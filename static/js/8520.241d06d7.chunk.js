There are few permanent secrets, and the scruple against revealing them will not last forever.","That which makes the vanity of others unbearable to us is that which wounds our own.","Tis more dishonourable to distrust a friend than to be deceived by him.","Misers mistake gold for their good; whereas \'tis only a means of attaining it.","There are some disguised falsehoods so like truths, that \'twould be to judge ill not to be deceived by them.","We bear, all of us, the misfortunes of other people with heroic constancy.","Not all who discharge their debts of gratitude should flatter themselves that they are grateful.","Of all the violent passions, the one that becomes a woman best is love.","There is a kind of love, the excess of which forbids jealousy.","Narrow minds think nothing right that is above their own capacity.","Youth changes its tastes by the warmth of its blood; age retains its tastes by habit.","To praise great actions with sincerity may be said to be taking part in them.","Avarice is more opposite to economy than liberality.","Men are not only prone to forget benefits; they even hate those who have obliged them, and cease to hate those who have injured them. The necessity of revenging an injury, or of recompensing a benefit seems a slavery to which they are unwilling to submit.","The generality of men have, like plants, latent properties, which chance brings to light.","Clemency, which we make a virtue of, proceeds sometimes from vanity, sometimes from indolence, often from fear, and almost always from a mixture of all three.","Confidence in conversation has a greater share than wit.","He is safe who admits no one to his confidence.","For the credit of virtue we must admit that the greatest misfortunes of men are those into which they fall through their crimes.","It is far better to be deceived than undeceived by those whom we tenderly love.","Fancy sets the value on the gifts of fortune.","A fool has not material enough to be good.\\n[Fr., Un sot n\'a pas assez d\'etoffe pour etre bon.]","Gravity is a mysterious carriage of the body invented to cover the defects of the mind.","We have more indolence in the mind than in the body.","Self-love is more cunning than the most cunning man in the world.","Men more easily renounce their interests than their tastes.","Generally speaking, we would make a good bargain by renouncing all the good that people say of us, upon condition they would say no ill.","We do not like to praise, and seldom praise anyone without self-interest.","Pride has a greater share than goodness in the reproofs we give other people for their faults; and we chide them not so much to make them mend those faults as to make them believe that we ourselves are without fault.","Nothing is more contagious than example, and no man does any exceeding good or exceeding ill but it spawns new deeds of the same kind. The good we imitate through emulation, the ill through the malignity of our nature, which shame keeps locked up, but example sets free.","Men are often so foolish as to boast and value themselves upon their passions, even those that are most vicious. But envy is a passion so full of cowardice and shame that no one every ever had the confidence to own it.","The passions of youth are not more dangerous to health than is the lukewarmness of old age.","A respectable man may love madly, but not foolishly.","In love deceit almost always outstrips distrust.","Lovers, when they are no longer in love, find it very hard to break up.","It is easier to rule others than to keep from being ruled oneself.","The esteem of good men is the reward of our worth, but the reputation of the world in general is the gift of our fate.","There are some people upon whom their very faults and failings sit gracefully; and there are others whose very excellencies and accomplishments do not become them.","Eloquence resides as much in the tone of voice, in the eyes, and in the expression of the face, as in the choice of words.","Humility is often only the putting on of a submissiveness by which men hope to bring other people to submit to them; it is a morecalculated sort of pride, which debases itself with a design of being exalted; and though this vice transform itself into a thousand several shapes, yet the disguise is never more effectual nor more capable of deceiving the world than when concealed under a form of humility.","Bravery in simple soldiers is a dangerous trade, to which they have bound themselves to get their livelihood.","The breeding we give young people is ordinarily but an additional self-love, by which we make them have a better opinion of themselves.","All men are equally proud. The only difference is that not all take the same methods of showing it.","What we cut off from our other faults is very often but so much added to our pride.","We often brag that we are never bored with ourselves, and are so vain as never to think ourselves bad company.","A weak mind is the only defect out of our power to mend.","Some good qualities are like the senses: Those who are entirely deprived of them can have no notion of them.","It is often hard to determine whether a clear, open, and honorable proceeding is the result of goodness or of cunning.","The exceeding delight we take in talking about ourselves should give us cause to fear that we are giving but very little pleasureto our listeners.","The moderation of men in the most exalted fortunes is a desire to be thought above those things that have raised them so high.","What makes the pain we feel from shame and jealousy so cutting is that vanity can give us no assistance in bearing them.","What men have called friendship is only a social arrangement, a mutual adjustment of interests, an interchange of services given and received; it is, in sum, simply a business from which those involved propose to derive a steady profit for their own self-love.","If we judge love by most of its effects, it resembles rather hatred than affection.","All the passions make us commit faults; love makes us commit the most ridiculous ones.","We are never so ridiculous through what we are as through what we pretend to be.","There are bad people who would be less dangerous if they were quite devoid of goodness.","Sometimes accidents happen in life from which we have need of a little madness to extricate ourselves successfully","The shame that arises from praise which we do not deserve often makes us do things we should otherwise never have attempted.","There are people who would never have been in love, had they never heard love spoken of.","Good taste comes more from the judgment than from the mind.","Humility is often a false front we employ to gain power over others.","One cannot answer for his courage when he has never been in danger.","Jealousy springs more from love of self than from love of another.","It is more often from pride than from ignorance that we are so obstinately opposed to current opinions; we find the first places taken, and we do not want to be the last.","Jealousy is bred in doubts. When those doubts change into certainties, then the passion either ceases or turns absolute madness.","Nothing is so contagious as example; and we never do any great good or evil which does not produce its like.","What is called generosity is usually only the vanity of giving; we enjoy the vanity more than the thing given.","Silence is the safest course for any man to adopt who distrust himself.","The intellect is always fooled by the heart.","The heart is forever making the head its fool.","Hope and fear are inseparable. There is no hope without fear, nor any fear without hope.","Most men, like plants, possess hidden qualities which chance discovers.","Passion often makes a fool of the cleverest man and often makes the most foolish men clever","Love, like fire, cannot subsist without constant impulse; it ceases to live from the moment it ceases to hope or to fear.","A true friend is the greatest of all blessings, and that which we take the least care of all to acquire.","Few know how to be old.","It is more difficult for a man to be faithful to his mistress when he is favored than when he is ill treated by her.","Organize one\'s values in the order of their worth","The great interests of man: air and light, the joy of having a body, the voluptuousness of looking.","Hope, deceitful as it is, carries us through life agreeably enough.","What men call friendship is no more than a partnership, a mutual care of interests, an exchange of favors - in a word, it is a sort of traffic, in which self-love ever proposes to be the gainer.","Old men delight in giving good advice as a consolation for the fact that they can no longer set bad examples.","Were we perfectly acquainted with the object, we should never passionately desire it.","We often boast that we are never bored; but yet we are so conceited that we do not perceive how often we bore others.","Esteem never makes ingrates.","It is not expedient or wise to examine our friends too closely; few persons are raised in our esteem by a close examination.","There are certain people fated to be fools; they not only commit follies by choice, but are even constrained to do so by fortune.","The qualities we have do not make us so ridiculous as those which we affect to have.\\n[Fr., On n\'est jamais si ridicule par les qualites que l\'on a que par celles que l\'on affecte d\'avoir.]","Many young persons believe themselves natural when they are only impolite and coarse.","We acknowledge that we should not talk of our wives; but we seem not to know that we should talk still less of ourselves.","Nothing is more ridiculous in old people that were once good-looking, than to forget that they are not so still.","There is a kind of elevation which does not depend on fortune; it is a certain air which distinguishes us, and seems to destine us for great things; it is a price which we imperceptibly set upon ourselves.","There are good marriages, but there are no delightful ones.","There are heroes in evil as well as in good.","Jealousy lives upon doubts. It becomes madness or ceases entirely as soon as we pass from doubt to certainty.","No accidents are so unlucky [bad] but that the wise may draw some advantage [good] from them.","There is a form of eminence which does not depend on fate; it is an air which sets us apart and seems to prtend great things; it is the value which we unconsciously attach to ourselves; it is the quality which wins us deference of others; more than birth, position, or ability, it gives us ascendance.","None but the contemptible are apprehensive of contempt.","The intention of cheating no one lays us open to being cheated ourselves.","Women find it far more difficult to overcome their inclination to coquetry than to overcome their love.","The most sure method of subjecting yourself to be deceived is to consider yourself more cunning than others.","In love the deceit generally outstrips the distrust.","It is easier for a man to be thought fit for an employment that he has not, than for one he stands already possessed of, and is exercising.","Our good qualities expose us more to hatred and persecution than all the ill we do.","Fortune mends more faults in us than ever reason would be able to do.","We often are consoled by our want of reason for misfortunes that reason could not have comforted.","In their early passions women are in love with the lover, later they are in love with love.","It is harder to hide the feelings we have than to feign the ones we do not have.","The first lover is kept a long while, when no offer is made of a second.","Jealousy is always born with love, but does not die with it. In jealousy there is more of self-love than of love to another.","Tricks and treachery are merely proofs of lack of skill.","Gratitude is a lively sense of benefits to come.","To know oneself is not necessarily to improve oneself","We give nothing so freely as advice.","We forget our faults easily when they are known to ourselves alone.","Absence cools moderate passions, and inflames violent ones; just as the wind blows out candles, but kindles fires.","Jealousy is not so much the love of another as the love of ourselves.","We are never either so fortunate or so misfortunate as we imagine.","Sincerity is a certain openness of heart. It is to be found in very few, and what we commonly look upon to be so is only a cunningsort of dissimulation, to insinuate ourselves into the confidence of others.","We had better appear what we are, than affect to appear what we are not.","Hope is the last thing that dies in man.","The wind which snuffs the candle fans the fire.","We take less pains to be happy, than to appear so.","Tis a sort of coquetry to boast that we never coquet.","The health of the soul is as precarious as that of the body; for when we seem secure from passions, we are no less in danger of their infection than we are of falling ill when we appear to be well.","True friendship destroys envy, and true love destroys coquetterie.","As the great ones of this world are unable to bestow health of body or peace of mind, we always pay too high a price for any good they can do.","Generosity is the vanity of giving.","We should not be much concerned about faults we have the courage to own.","Women in love sooner forgive great indiscretions than small infidelities.","Few people know death, we only endure it, usually from determination, and even from stupidity and custom; and most men only die because they know not how to prevent dying.","Passion makes idiots of the cleverest men, and makes the biggest idiots clever.","Love is the smallest part of gallantry.","Few men know all the ill they do.","The rust of business is sometimes polished off in a camp; but never in a court.","Passions often produce their contraries: avarice sometimes leads to prodigality, and prodigality to avarice; we are often obstinate through weakness and daring through timidity.","A well-trained mind has less difficulty in submitting to than in guiding an ill-trained mind.","Cunning and treachery proceed from want of capacity.","That conduct often seems ridiculous the secret reasons of which are wise and solid.","The clemency of Princes is often but policy to win the affections of the people.","Men sometimes think they hate flattery, but they hate only the manner of flattering.","A fool has not stuff enough to make a good man.","The moderation of fortunate people comes from the calm which good fortune gives to their tempers.","Boredom ... causes us to neglect more duties than does interest.","The passions often engender their contraries.","What makes false reckoning, as regards gratitude, is that the pride of the giver and the receiver cannot agree as to the value of the benefit.","We may say of agreeableness, as distinct from beauty, that it consists in a symmetry of which we know not the rules, and a secret conformity of the features to each other, as also to the air and complexion of the person.","Beautiful coquettes are quacks of love.","Old fools are greater fools than young ones.","Passion often renders the most clever man a fool, and sometimes renders the most foolish man clever.","We seldom find people ungrateful so long as it is thought we can serve them.","We often forgive those who bore us, but we cannot forgive those whom we bore.","Hypocrisy is an homage that vice renders to virtue.","He is not to pass for a man of reason who stumbles upon reason by chance but he who knows it and can judge it and has a true taste for it.","The sicknesses of the soul have their ups and downs like those of the body; what we take to be a cure is most often merely a respite or change of disease.","Spiritual health is no more stable than bodily; and though we may seem unaffected by the passions we are just as liable to be carried away by them as to fall ill when in good health.","As it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words, so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing.","Sobriety is concern for one\'s health - or limited capacity.","Every one complains of a poor memory, no one of a weak judgment.","We often in our misfortunes take that for constancy and patience which is only dejection of mind; we suffer without daring to holdup our heads, just as cowards let themselves be knocked on the head because they have not courage to strike back.","Avarice is more directly opposed to thrift than generosity is.","Envy is more incapable of reconciliation than hatred is.","The only thing that should astonish us is that anything can yet astonish us.","There are but very few men clever enough to know all the mischief they do.","Most people know no other way of judging men\'s worth but by the vogue they are in, or the fortunes they have met with.","Never give anyone the advice to buy or sell shares, because the most benevolent price of advice can turn out badly.","Flattery is a base coin which is current only through our vanity.","There are reproaches which praise, and praises which defame.","It is difficult to like those whom we do not esteem; but it is no less so to like those whom we esteem more than ourselves.","People would not long remain in social life if they were not the dupes of each other.","Reason alone is insufficient to make us enthusiastic in any matter.","What we take for virtue is often nothing but an assemblage of different actions, and of different interests, that fortune or our industry knows how to arrange.","However wicked men may be, they do not dare openly to appear the enemies of virtue, and when they desire to persecute her they either pretend to believe her false or attribute crimes to her.","Luxury and excessive refinement are sure forerunners of the decadence of states, because when all individuals seek their own interests they neglect the public weal.","We are inconsolable at being deceived by our enemies and being betrayed by our friends, yet we are often content in be being treated like that by our own selves.","It\'s the height of folly to want to be the only wise one.","The passions possess a certain injustice and self interest which makes it dangerous to follow them, and in reality we should distrust them even when they appear most trustworthy.","Coquetry is the essential characteristic, and the prevalent humor of women; but they do not all practice it, because the coquetry of some is restrained by fear or by reason.","Time\'s chariot-wheels make their carriage-road in the fairest face.","Novelty is to love like bloom to fruit; it gives a luster which is easily effaced, but never returns.","Politeness is a desire to be treated politely, and to be esteemed polite oneself.","There are various sorts of curiosity; one is from interest, which makes us desire to know that which may be useful to us; and the other, from pride which comes from the wish to know what others are ignorant of.","It is only persons of firmness that can have real gentleness. Those who appear gentle are, in general, only a weak character, which easily changes into asperity.","It is easier to deceive yourself, and to do so unperceived, than to deceive another.","Some reproaches praise; some praises reproach.","Nothing should lessen our satisfaction with ourselves as much as when we notice that we disapprove of something at one time that we approve of at another time.","All our qualities, whether good or bad, are unstable and ambiguous, and almost all are at the mery of chance.","It is much easier to seem fitted for posts we do not fill than for those we do.","What we call generosity is for the most part only the vanity of giving; and we exercise it because we are more fond of that vanity than of the thing we give.","Those who are overreached by our cunning are far from appearing to us as ridiculous as we appear to ourselves when the cunning of others has overreached us.","Truth is the foundation and the reason of the perfection of beauty, for of whatever stature a thing may be, it cannot be beautiful-and perfect, unless it be truly what it should be, and possess truly all that it should have.","To awaken a man who is deceived as to his own merit is to do him as bad a turn as that done to the Athenian madman who was happy in believing that all the ships touching at the port belonged to him.","The prospect of being pleased tomorrow will never console me for the boredom of today.","No man can love a second time the person whom he has once truly ceased to love.","As we grow older we grow both more foolish and wiser at the same time.","A wise man should order his interests, and set them all in their proper places. This order is often troubled by greed, which putsus upon pursuing so many things at once that, in eagerness for matters of less consideration, we grasp at trifles, and let go things of greater value.","One should treat one\'s fate as one does one\'s health; enjoy it when it is good, be patient with it when it is poor, and never attempt any drastic cure save as an ultimate resort.","It is not enough that we should succeed, but our friends must fail as well.","It is often merely for an excuse that we say things are impossible.","When a man must force himself to be faithful in his love, this is hardly better than unfaithfulness.","A lofty mind always thinks nobly, it easily creates vivid, agreeable, and natural fancies, places them in their best light, clothes them with all appropriate adornments, studies others\' tastes, and clears away from its own thoughts all that is useless and disagreeable.","Indolence, languid as it is, often masters both passions and virtues.","Were we faultless, we would not derive such satisfaction from remarking the faults of others.","The reason why most women have so little sense of friendship is that this is but a cold and flat passion to those that have felt that of love.","Philosophy triumphs easily over past evils and future evils, but present evils triumph over it.","Fortune cures us of many faults that reason could not.","Humility is often merely feigned submissiveness assumed in order to subject others, an artifice of pride which stoops to conquer, and although pride has a thousand ways of transforming itself it is never so well disguised and able to take people in as when masquerading as humility.","Few things are impossible in themselves: application to make them succeed fails us more often than the means.","High fortune makes both our virtues and vices stand out as objects that are brought clearly to view by the light.","We often do shallow good in order to accomplish evil with impunity.","We love much better those who endeavor to imitate us, than those who strive to equal us. For imitation is a sign of esteem, but competition of envy.","The soul\'s maladies have their relapses like the body\'s. What we take for a cure is often just a momentary rally or a new form of the disease.","Most men expose themselves in battle enough to save their honor, few wish to do so more than sufficiently, or than is necessary to make the design for which they expose themselves succeed.","We judge so superficially of things, that common words and actions spoke and done in an agreeable manner, with some knowledge of what passes in the world, often succeed beyond the greatest ability.","It is as easy to deceive one\'s self without perceiving it, as   it is difficult to deceive others without their finding out.","The reason why lovers and their mistresses never tire of being together is that they are always talking of themselves.\\n[Fr., Ce qui fait que amants et les maitresses ne s\'ennuient point d\'etre ensemble; c\'est qu\'ils parlent toujours d\'eux memes.]","If we took as much pains to be what we ought, as we do to deceive others by disguising what we are; we might appear as we are, without being at the trouble of any disguise.","Philosophy finds it an easy matter to vanquish past and future evils, but the present are commonly too hard for it.","Jealousy is the greatest of all evils, and the one that arouses the least pity in the person who causes it.","A man often imagines that he acts, when he is acted upon.","Men may boast of their great actions; but they are more often the effects of chance than of design.","The dullness of certain people is sometimes a sufficient security against the attack of an artful man.","A man often thinks he rules himself, when all the while he is ruled and managed; and while his understanding directs one design, his affections imperceptibly draw him into another.","History never embraces more than a small part of reality","True bravery means doing alone that which one could do if all the world were by.","Sobriety is love of health, or inability to eat much.","Friendship is insipid to those who have experienced love.","Of all our faults, the one we avow most easily is idleness; we persuade ourselves that it is allied to all the peaceable virtues,and as for the others, that it does not destroy them utterly, but only suspends the exercise of their functions.","There are more defects in temperament than in the mind.","There are no events so disastrous that adroit men do not draw some advantage from them, nor any so fortunate that the imprudent cannot turn to their own prejudice.","We sometimes think that we hate flattery, but we only hate the manner in which it is done.\\n[Fr., On croit quelquefoir hair la flatterie; maid on ne hait que a maniere de flatter.]","The health of the soul is something we can be no more sure of than that of the body; and though a man may seem far from the passions, yet he is in as much danger of falling into them as one in a perfect state of health of having a fit of sickness.","There are some good marriages, but practically no delightful ones.","He who lives without committing any folly is not so wise as he thinks.\\n[Fr., Qui vit sans folie n\'est pas si sage qu\'il croit.]","There are some who never would have loved if they never had heard it spoken of.","Things often offer themselves to our mind in a more finished form in the very first thought, than we might have made them by muchart and study.","Love of glory, fear of shame, greed for fortune, the desire to make life agreeable and comfortable, and the wish to depreciate others - all of these are often the causes of the bravery that is spoken so highly of by men.","Humility is often only feigned submission which people use to render others submissive. It is a subterfuge of pride which lowers itself in order to rise.","The courage of a great many men, and the virtue of a great many women, are the effect of vanity, shame, and especially a suitabletemperament.","Fearlessness is a more than ordinary strength of mind, which raises the soul above the troubles, disorders, and emotions which theprospect of great dangers are used to produce. And by this inward strength it is that heroes preserve themselves in a calm and quiet state, and enjoy a presence of mind and the free use of their reason in the midst of those terrible accidents that amaze and confound other people.","We do not lack strength so much as the will to use it; and very often our imagining that things are impossible is nothing but an excuse of our own contriving, to reconcile ourselves to our own idleness.","We have not strength enough to follow our reason so far as it would carry us.","Were we not proud ourselves, we should not complain of the pride of others.","Nothing ought in reason to mortify our self-satisfaction more that the considering that we condemn at one time what we highly approve and commend at another.","Humility is the sure evidence of Christian virtues. Without it, we retain all our faults still, and they are only covered over with pride, which hides them from other men\'s observation, and sometimes from our own too.","There are heroes of wickedness, as there are of goodness.","The reason why lovers are never bored together is that they are always talking of themselves.","When we seek reconciliation with our enemies, it is commonly out of a desire to better our own condition, a being harassed and tired out with a state of war, and a fear of some ill accident which we are willing to prevent.","Self-love is the love of a man\'s own self, and of everything else for his own sake. It makes people idolaters to themselves, and tyrants to all the world besides.","Treachery is more often the effect of weakness than of a formed design.","Great men\'s honor ought always to be measured by the methods they made use of in attaining it.","Fortune makes our virtues and vices visible, just as light does the objects of sight.","Virtue would not make such advances if there were not a little vanity to keep it company.","Virtues lose themselves in self-interest, as rivers in the sea.","The older a fool is, the worse he is.","Men frequently do good only to give themselves opportunity of doing ill with impunity.","The appearances of goodness and merit often meet with a greater reward from the world than goodness and merit themselves.","The whimsicalness of our own humor is a thousand times more fickle and unaccountable than what we blame so much in fortune.","There are a great many simpletons who know themselves to be so, and who make a very cunning use of their own simplicity.","Some men are like ballads, that are in everyone\'s mouth a little while.","Affected simplicity is a subtle imposture.","A readiness to believe ill of others, before we have duly examined it, is the effect of laziness and pride. We are eager to find aculprit, and loath to give ourselves the trouble of examining the crime.","No one thinks fortune so blind as those she has been least kind to.","A man may be sharper than another, but not than all others.","There are few people who would not be ashamed of being loved when they love no longer.","We own up to minor failings, but only so as to convince others that we have no major ones.","We make promises to the extent that we hope-and keep them to the extent that we fear.","Preserving the serious health condition is usually painful.","It is a mistake to imagine, that the violent passions only, such as ambition and love, can triumph over the rest. Idleness, languid as it is, often masters them all; she influences all our designs and actions, and insensibly consumes and destroys both passions and virtues.","A man often believes himself leader when he is led; as his mind endeavors to reach one goal, his heart insensibly drags him towards another.","The more we love, the nearer we are to hate.","The fame of great men ought to be judged always by their big, fancy names.","The only real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes. The glory of great men should always be measured by the means they have used to acpuire it.","There are two things which Man cannot look at directly without flinching: the sun and death.","Jealousy contains more of self-love than of love.","The man that thinks he loves his mistress for her own sake is mightily mistaken.","However rare true love may be, it is less so than true friendship.","People that are conceited of their own merit take pride in being unfortunate, that themselves and others may think them considerable enough to be the envy and the mark of fortune.","We seldom find any person of good sense, except those who share our opinions.","The more one loves a mistress, the more one is ready to hate her.","In love we often doubt what we most believe.","Flattery is a kind of bad money, to which our vanity gives us currency.","Virtue would go far if vanity did not keep it company.","Funeral pomp is more for the vanity of the living than for the honor of the dead.","The surest way to be deceived is to consider oneself cleverer than others.","It is a great act of cleverness to be able to conceal one\'s being clever.","It is often laziness and timidity that keep us within our duty while virtue gets all the credit.","However greatly we distrust the sincerity of those we converse with, yet still we think they tell more truth to us than to anyone else.","It is not enough to have great qualities; We should also have the management of them.","The principal point of cleverness is to know how to value things just as they deserve.","Our aversion to lying is commonly a secret ambition to make what we say considerable, and have every word received with a religious respect.","It is almost always a fault of one who loves not to realize when he ceases to be loved.","People always complain about their memories, never about their minds.","Why is it that our memory is good enough to retain the least triviality that happens to us, and yet not good enough to recollect how often we have told it to the same person?","Innocence does not find near so much protection as guilt.","The happiness and misery of men depend no less on temper than fortune.","If it were not for the company of fools, a witty man would often be greatly at a loss.","Men give away nothing so liberally as their advice.","The desire of talking of ourselves, and showing those faults we do not mind having seen, makes up a good part of our sincerity.","There are few virtuous women who are not bored with their trade.","When a man is in love, he doubts, very often, what he most firmly believes.","Everyone complains of his memory, and nobody complains of his judgment.","Repentance is not so much remorse for what we have done as the fear of the consequences.","The reason why so few people are agreeable in conversation is that each is thinking more about what he intends to say than others are saying.","A great many men\'s gratitude is nothing but a secret desire to hook in more valuable kindnesses hereafter.","Weakness of character is the only defect which cannot be amended.","Being a blockhead is sometimes the best security against being cheated by a man of wit.","However glorious an action in itself, it ought not to pass for great if it be not the effect of wisdom and intention.","We get so much in the habit of wearing disguises before others that we finally appear disguised before ourselves.","Old people love to give good advice; it compensates them for their inability to set a bad example.","Some counterfeits reproduce so very well the truth that it would be a flaw of judgment not to be deceived by them.","Hope, deceiving as it is, serves at least to lead us to the end of our lives by an agreeable route.","In the misfortunes of our best friends we always find something not altogether displeasing to us.","Some accidents there are in life that a little folly is necessary to help us out of.","The mind cannot long play the heart\'s role.","We are very far from always knowing our own wishes.","If we have not peace within ourselves, it is in vain to seek it from outward sources.","We come altogether fresh and raw into the several stages of life, and often find ourselves without experience, despite our years.","We say little, when vanity does not make us speak.","Perfect courage is to do without witnesses what one would be capable of doing with the world looking on.","The desire to seem clever often keeps us from being so.","The generality of virtuous women are like hidden treasures, they are safe only because nobody has sought after them.","It is not in the power of even the most crafty dissimulation to conceal love long, where it really is, nor to counterfeit it long where it is not.","Moderation is the feebleness and sloth of the soul, whereas ambition is the warmth and activity of it.","Only the contemptible fear contempt.","There are very few people who are not ashamed of having been in love when they no longer love each other.","Those who are incapable of committing great crimes do not readily suspect them in others.","We are all strong enough to bear other men\'s misfortunes.","We are so used to dissembling with others that in time we come to deceive and dissemble with ourselves.","A man\'s worth has its season, like fruit.","Fortune converts everything to the advantage of her favorites.","Heat of blood makes young people change their inclinations often, and habit makes old ones keep to theirs a great while.","It is with an old love as it is with old age a man lives to all the miseries, but is dead to all the pleasures.","\u03a4\u03bf know how to profit by good advice, requires nearly as much ability as to know how to act for one\'self.","Love often leads on to ambition, but seldom does one return from ambition to love.","Perfect valour consists in doing without witnesses that which we would be capable of doing before everyone.","Pride, which inspires us with so much envy, is sometimes of use toward the moderating of it too.","The greatest part of intimate confidences proceed from a desire either to be pitied or admired.","The moderation of people in prosperity is the effect of a smooth and composed temper, owing to the calm of their good fortune.","The one thing people are the most liberal with, is their advice.","The virtues and vices are all put in motion by interest.","There is many a virtuous woman weary of her trade.","Timidity is a fault for which it is dangerous to reprove persons whom we wish to correct of it.","To know how to hide one\'s ability is great skill.","Usually we praise only to be praised.","We do not despise all those who have vices, but we do despise those that have no virtue.","We only confess our little faults to persuade people that we have no big ones.","We seldom praise anyone in good earnest, except such as admire us.","What keeps us from abandoning ourselves entirely to one vice, often, is the fact that we have several.","Whatever good things people say of us, they tell us nothing new.","Few things are impracticable in themselves; and it is for want of application, rather than of means, that men fail to succeed.","Great souls are not those who have fewer passions and more virtues than others, but only those who have greater designs.","If we resist our passions, it is more due to their weakness than our strength.","In the human heart new passions are forever being born; the overthrow of one almost always means the rise of another.","It is easier to know men in general, than men in particular.","Neither the sun nor death can be looked at steadily.","That good disposition which boasts of being most tender is often stifled by the least urging of self-interest.","The accent of a man\'s native country remains in his mind and his heart, as it does in his speech.","There are crimes which become innocent and even glorious through their splendor, number and excess.","There is nothing men are so generous of as advice.","Those that have had great passions esteem themselves for the rest of their lives fortunate and unfortunate in being cured of them.","Too great haste to repay an obligation is a kind of ingratitude.","We all have enough strength to endure the misfortunes of others.","We are easily comforted for the misfortunes of our friends, when those misfortunes give us an occasion of expressing our affection and solicitude.","We are nearer loving those who hate us than those who love us more than we wish.","We do not praise others, ordinarily, but in order to be praised ourselves.","We easily forgive our friends those faults that do no affect us ourselves.","We may sooner be brought to love them that hate us, than them that love us more than we would have them do.","We pardon to the extent that we love.","We would rather speak ill of ourselves than not talk about ourselves at all.","Women\'s virtue is frequently nothing but a regard to their own quiet and a tenderness for their reputation.","Our concern for the loss of our friends is not always from a sense of their worth, but rather of our own need of them and that we have lost some who had a good opinion of us.","A work can become modern only if it is first postmodern. Postmodernism thus understood is not modernism at its end but in the nascent state, and this state is constant.","No man deserves to be praised for his goodness, who has it not in his power to be wicked. Goodness without that power is generally nothing more than sloth, or an impotence of will.","Nature seems at each man\'s birth to have marked out the bounds of his virtues and vices, and to have determined how good or how wicked that man shall be capable of being.","If there be a love pure and free from the admixture of our other passions, it is that which lies hidden in the bottom of our heart, and which we know not ourselves.","Our actions seem to have their lucky and unlucky stars, to which a great part of that blame and that commendation is due which is given to the actions themselves.","Love can no more continue without a constant motion than fire can; and when once you take hope and fear away, you take from it its very life and being.","In all professions each affects a look and an exterior to appear what he wishes the world to believe that he is. Thus we may say that the whole world is made up of appearances.","Though men are apt to flatter and exalt themselves with their great achievements, yet these are, in truth, very often owing not so much to design as chance.","Our enemies come nearer the truth in the opinions they form of us than we do in our opinion of ourselves.","Listening well and answering well is one of the greatest perfections that can be obtained in conversation.","Second-rate minds usually condemn everything beyond their grasp.","Of all our faults, the one that we excuse most easily is idleness.","Those who most obstinately oppose the most widely-held opinions more often do so because of pride than lack of intelligence. They find the best places in the right set already taken, and they do not want back seats.","One may outwit another, but not all the others.","There are few things we should keenly desire if we really knew what we wanted.","In the human heart one generation of passions follows another; from the ashes of one springs the spark of the next.","There are some people who would never have fallen in love if they had not heard there was such a thing.","We forgive just so long as we love.","Passion often makes fools of the wisest men and gives the silliest wisdom.","Extreme boredom provides its own antidote.","We are almost always bored by just those whom we must not find boring.","Imagination could never invent the number of different contradictions that exist innately in each person\'s heart.","The confidence which we have in ourselves give birth to much of that, which we have in others.","To safeguard one\'s health at the cost of too strict a diet is a tiresome illness, indeed.","The temperament that produces a talent for little things is the opposite of that required for great ones.","Some beautiful things are more dazzling when they are still imperfect than when they have been too perfectly crafted.","We would rather see those to whom we do good, than those who do good to us.","If we had no faults, we would not derive so much pleasure from noting those of other people.","The truest mark of being born with great qualities is to be born without envy.","If we did not have pride, we would not complain of it in others.","Happiness is in the taste, and not in the things.","There is such a thing as a general revolution which changes the taste of men as it changes the fortunes of the world.","True bravery is shown by performing without witness what one might be capable of doing before all the world.","The measure of great men should always be measured by the means they have used to acquire it.","Our enemies\' opinion of us comes closer to the truth than our own.","The greatest of all gifts is the power to estimate things at their true worth","It is with certain good qualities as with the senses; those who have them not can neither appreciate nor comprehend them in others.","Our minds are lazier than our bodies.","Nature creates ability; luck provides it with opportunity.","The violence done us by others is often less painful than that which we do to ourselves.","It\'s easier to know people in general than one person in particular","The world more often rewards the appearances of merit than merit itself.","We never desire strongly, what we desire rationally.","Women know not the whole of their coquetry.","We pardon as long as we love.","The greatest miracle of love is the cure of coquetry.","It seems that nature, which has so wisely disposed our bodily organs with a view to our happiness, has also bestowed on us pride, to spare us the pain of being aware of our imperfections.","Hope and fear are inseparable.","To establish yourself in the world a person must do all they can to appear already established.","Vanity, shame, and above all disposition, often make men brave and women chaste.","It is not always from valor or from chastity that men are brave, and women chaste.","What makes us so often discontented with those who transact business for us is that they almost always abandon the interest of their friends for the interest of the business, because they wish to have the honor of succeeding in that which they have undertaken.","It appears that nature has hid at the bottom of our hearts talents and abilities unknown to us. It is only the passions that have the power of bringing them to light, and sometimes give us views more true and more perfect than art could possibly do.","When fortune surprises us by giving us some great office without having gradually led us to expect it, or without having raised our hopes, it is well nigh impossible to occupy it well, and to appear worthy to fill it.","The qualities we have, make us so ridiculous as those which we affect.","What renders other people\'s vanity insufferable is that it wounds our own.","Whilst weakness and timidity keep us to our duty, virtue has often all the honor.","The only good copies are those which make us see the absurdity of bad originals.","A man convinced of his own merit will accept misfortune as an honor, for thus can he persuade others, as well as himself, that he is a worthy target for the arrows of fate.","It is as easy to unknowingly deceive yourself as it is to deceive others.","There are people who in spite of their merit disgust us and others who please us in spite of their faults.","The person giving the advice returns the confidence placed in him with a disinterested eagerness... and he is usually guided only by his own interest or reputation.","We label judges with having the meanest motives, and yet we desire that our reputation and fame should depend upon the judgment of men, who are all, either from their jealousy or preoccupation or want of intelligence, opposed to us - and yet despite their bias, just for the sake of making these men decide in our favor, we peril in so many ways both our peace and our life.","Ideas often flash across our minds more complete than we could make them after much labor.","Imagination does not enable us to invent as many different contradictions as there are by nature in every heart.","Pity is often a reflection of our own evils in the ills of others. It is a delicate foresight of the troubles into which we may fall.","Some allow themselves to be overcome by panic, and others charge because they dare not remain at their posts. Some may be found whose courage is strengthened by small perils that prepare them to face greater dangers. Some are daring when facing swords but dread facing bullets; others dread bullets little but fear facing swords a lot.","Behind many acts that are thought ridiculous there lie wise and weighty motives.","No matter how brilliant an action, it should not be considered great unless it was the result of a great motive.","Moderation in people who are contented comes from that calm that good fortune lends to their spirit.","Renewed friendships require more care than those that have never been broken.","A clever man should handle his interests so that each will fall in suitable order of their value.","The intention of never deceiving often exposes us to deception.","The extreme delight we experience in talking about ourselves should warn us that those who listen do not share it.","When we exaggerate our friends\' tenderness towards us, it is often less from gratitude than from a desire to exhibit our own virtue.","To boast that one never flirts is actually a kind of flirtation.","Women do not know all their powers of flirtation.","We have more ability than will power, and it is often an excuse to ourselves that we imagine that things are impossible.","We are never so easily deceived as when we imagine we are deceiving others.","Avarice misapprehends itself almost always. There is no passion which more often will miss its aim, nor upon which the present has so much influence to the prejudice of the future.","When our vices desert us, we flatter ourselves that we are deserting our vices.","We often bore others when we think we cannot possibly bore them.","Weakness is the only fault that is incorrigible.","Weakness is more opposed to virtue than is vice.","The pleasure of love is in loving; we are happier in the passion we feel than in what we inspire.","Some people are like popular songs that you only sing for a short time.","The gratitude of most men is but a secret desire of receiving greater benefits.","There are two sorts of constancy in love one arises from continually discovering in the loved person new subjects for love, the other arises from our making a merit of being constant.","It requires greater virtues to support good fortune than bad.","One can no more look steadily at death than at the sun.","What makes vanity so insufferable to us, is that it hurts our own.","Self-love is the greatest of all flatterers.","What makes lovers never tire of one another is that they talk always about themselves.","There are few good women who do not tire of their role.","What is called liberality is often merely the vanity of giving.","The common foible of women who have been handsome is to forget that they are no longer so.","Old people are fond of giving good advice; it consoles them for no longer being capable of setting a bad example.","People would never fall in love if they hadn\'t heard love talked about.","A woman is faithful to her first lover for a long time - unless she happens to take a second.","On why I don\'t trust democracy without extremely powerful systems of accountability and recall What seems to be generosity is often only disguised ambition - which despises small interests to gain great ones.","When love becomes labored we welcome an act of infidelity towards ourselves to free us from fidelity.","Our actions are like the terminations of verses, which we rhyme as we please.","You are never so easily fooled as when trying to fool someone else.","To establish oneself in the world, one does all one can to seem established there already.","The height of ability consists in a thorough knowledge of the real value of things, and of the genius of the age in which we live.","We should only affect compassion, and carefully avoid having any.","Politeness of the mind is to have delicate thoughts","There are no circumstances, however unfortunate, that clever people do not extract some advantage from.","Nature has concealed at the bottom of our minds talents and abilities of which we are not aware.","We sometimes imagine we hate flattery, but we only hate the way we are flattered.","We often credit ourselves with vices the reverse of what we have, thus when weak we boast of our obstinacy.","Nothing is given so profusely as advice.","In growing old, we become more foolish - and more wise.","It is a wearisome disease to preserve health by too strict a regimen.","If it requires great tact to speak to the purpose, it requires no less to know when to be silent.","Whatever pretext we may give for our affections, often it is only interest and vanity which cause them.","Nothing ought more to humiliate men who have merited great praise than the care they still take to boast of little things.","Perfect courage and utter cowardice are two extremes which rarely occur.","It is more often from pride than from defective understanding that people oppose established opinions: they find the best places taken in the good party and are reluctant to accept inferior ones.","\u039fur own distrust somewhat justifies the deceit of others.","Envy is destroyed by true friendship, as coquetry by true love.","The head does not know how to play the part of the heart for long.","Fortunate persons hardly ever amend their ways: they always imagine that they are in the right when fortune upholds their bad conduct.","Fortune never appears so blind as to those to whom she does no good.","The greater part of mankind judge of men only by their fashionableness or their fortune.","Love\'s greatest miracle is the curing of coquetry.","Friendship is only a reciprocal conciliation of interests, and an exchange of good offices; it is a species of commerce out of which self-love always expects to gain something.","We are better pleased to see those on whom we confer benefits than those from whom we receive them.","Gratitude is like credit; it is the backbone of our relations; frequently we pay our debts not because equity demands that we should, but to facilitate future loans.","However great the advantages given us by nature, it is not she alone, but fortune with her, which makes heroes.","Happy people rarely correct their faults; they consider themselves vindicated, since fortune endorses their evil ways.","In love deceit nearly always goes further than mistrust.","Great names abase, instead of elevating, those who do not know how to bear them.","In great affairs we ought to apply ourselves less to creating chances than to profiting from those that offer.","Men would not live in society long if they were not each others dupes.","In the human heart there is a ceaseless birth of passions, so that the destruction of one is almost always the establishment of another.","The duration of our passions is no more dependent on ourselves than the duration of our lives.","Solemnity is a device of the body to hide the faults of the mind.","We often pride ourselves on even the most criminal passions, but envy is a timid and shamefaced passion we never dare to acknowledge.","Ridicule dishonours more than dishonour.","There is merit without rank, but there is no rank without some merit.","The only security is courage.","Affected simplicity is an elegant imposture.","However much we may distrust men\'s sincerity, we always believe they speak to us more sincerely than to others.","The extreme pleasure we take in speaking of ourselves should make us apprehensive that it gives hardly any to those who listen to us.","We feel good and ill only in proportion to our self-love.","There are some bad qualities which make great talents.","Sometimes we think we dislike flattery, but it is only the way it is done that we dislike.","Tastes in young people are changed by natural impetuosity, and in the aged are preserved by habit.","However evil men may be they dare not be openly hostile to virtue, and so when they want to attack it they pretend to find it spurious , or impute crimes to it.","Many men are contemptuous of riches; few can give them away.","It often happens that things come into the mind in a more finished form than could have been achieved after much study.","There are no accidents so unlucky from which clever people are not able to reap some advantage, and none so lucky that the foolish are not able to turn them to their own disadvantage.","Humility is the altar upon which God wishes that we should offer Him His sacrifices.","Idleness is more an infirmity of the mind than of the body.","We endeavor to make a virtue of the faults we are unwilling to correct.","Silence is the best tactic for he who distrusts himself.","It requires no small degree of ability to know when to conceal one\'s ability.","Our actions are like blank rhymes, to which everyone applies what sense he pleases.","The ambitious deceive themselves in proposing an end to their ambition; that end, when attained, becomes a means.","Those who have the most cunning affect all their lives to condemn cunning; that they may make use of it on some great occasion, and to some great end.","For envy, like lightning, generally strikes at the top Or any point which sticks out from the ordinary level. LUCRETIUS, De Rerum Natura Our envy always outlives the felicity of its object.","One of the greatest and also the commonest of faults is for men to believe that, because they never hear their shortcomings spoken of, or read about them in cold print, others can have no knowledge of them. GEORG CHRISTOPH LICHTENBERG, The Reflections of Lichtenberg We are often more agreeable through our faults than our good qualities.","Though most of the friendships of the world ill deserve the name of friendships; yet a man may make use of them on occasion, as of a traffic whose returns are uncertain, and in which \'tis usual to be cheated.","There are few women whose charm survives their beauty.","There are women who never had an intrigue; but there are scarce any who never had but one.","Constancy in love ... is only inconstancy confined to one object.","Our merit gains us the esteem of the virtuous-our star that of the public.","Nothing is so contagious as example; never was there any considerable good or ill done that does not produce its like. We imitate good actions through emulation, and had ones through a malignity in our nature, which shame conceals, and example sets at liberty.","There are follies as catching as contagious disorders.","Flattery is false money, which would not be current were it not for our vanity.","If we never flattered ourselves we should have but scant pleasure.","Interest blinds some people, and enlightens others.","As love increases, prudence diminishes.","In infants, levity is a prettiness; in men a shameful defect; but in old age, a monstrous folly.","Nature makes merit, and fortune puts it to work.","The mark of extraordinary merit is to see those most envious of it constrained to praise.","Penetration has an air of divination; it pleases our vanity more than any other quality of the mind.","There are people who, like new songs, are in vogue only for a time.","The contempt of riches in the philosophers was a concealed desire of revenging on fortune the injustice done to their merit, by despising the good she denied them.","Moderation cannot have the credit of combatiug and subduing ambition, they are never found together. Moderation is the languor and indolence of the soul, as ambition is its activity and ardor.","Good and bad fortune are found severally to visit those who have the most of the one or the other.","Our probity is not less at the mercy of fortune than our property.","The good or the bad fortune of men depends not less upon their own dispositions than upon fortune.","Self-love increases or diminishes for us the good qualities of our friends, in proportion to the satisfaction we feel with them; and we judge of their merit by the manner in which they act towards us.","The generality of friends puts us out of conceit with friendship; just as the generality of religious people puts us out of conceit with religion.","Friendship is a traffic wherein self-love always proposes to be the gainer.","We love everything on our own account; we even follow our own taste and inclination when we prefer our friends to ourselves; and yet it is this preference alone that constitutes true and perfect friendship.","Great men should not have great faults.","Those whom the world has delighted to honor have oftener been influenced in their doings by ambition and vanity than by patriotism.","All who know their own minds know not their own hearts.","One honor won is a surety for more.","There are several remedies which will cure love, but there are no infallible ones.","In misfortune we often mistake dejection for constancy; we bear it without daring to look on it; like cowards, who suffer themselves to be murdered without resistance.","Pity is a sense of our own misfortunes in those of another man; it is a sort of foresight of the disasters which may befall ourselves. We assist others,, in order that they may assist us on like occasions; so that the services we offer to the unfortunate are in reality so many anticipated kindnesses to ourselves.","Prudence and love are inconsistent; in proportion as the last increases, the other decreases.","There is no praise we have not lavished upon prudence; and yet she cannot assure to us the most trifling event.","Nothing is so capable of diminishing self-love as the observation that we disapprove at one time what we approve at another.","Self-love, as it happens to be well or ill conducted, constitutes virtue and vice.","Whatever discoveries we may have made in the regions of self-love, there still remain many unknown lands.","It is with sincere affection or friendship as with ghosts and apparitions,--a thing that everybody talks of, and scarce any hath seen.","Kings do with men as with pieces of money; they give them what value they please, and we are obliged to receive them at their current and not at their real value.","It may be said that the vices await us in the journey of life like hosts with whom we must successively lodge; and I doubt whether experience would make us avoid them if we were to travel the same road a second time.","The vices enter into the composition of the virtues, as poisons into that of medicines. Prudence collects and arranges them, and uses them beneficially against the ills of life.","What often prevents our abandoning ourselves to a single vice is, our having more than one.","The vivacity that augments with years is not far from folly.","We should wish for few things with eagerness, if we perfectly knew the nature of that which was the object of our desire.","The most brilliant fortunes are often not worth the littleness required to gain them.","Our wisdom is no less at fortune\'s mercy than our wealth.","Wit sometimes enables us to act rudely with impunity.","A man does not please long when he has only species of wit.","A small degree of wit, accompanied by good sense, is less tiresome in the long run than a great amount of wit without it.","Women can less easily surmount their coquetry than their passions.","As it is the mark of great minds to say many things in a few words, so it is that of little minds to use many words to say nothing.","Youth is a continual intoxication; it is the fever of reason.","Moral severity in women is only a dress or paint which they use to set off their beauty.","To think to be wise alone is a very great folly.","The desire to be thought clever often prevents a man from becoming so.","As we grow older, we increase in folly--and in wisdom.","Our wisdom lies as much at the mercy of fortune as our possessions do.","There is an excess both in happiness and misery above our power of sensation.","Happiness does not consist in things themselves but in the relish we have of them; and a man has attained it when he enjoys what he loves and desires himself, and not what other people think lovely and desirable.","Men\'s happiness and misery depends altogether as much upon their own humor as it does upon fortune.","What we take for virtue is often but an assemblage of various ambitions and activities that chance, or our own astuteness, have arranged in a certain manner; and it is not always out of courage or purity that men are brave, and women chaste.","If one judges love according to the greatest part of the effects it produces, it would appear to resemble rather hatred than kindness.","As long as we love, we can forgive.","Self-love makes our friends appear more or less deserving in proportion to the delight we take in them, and the measures by whichwe judge of their worth depend upon the manner of their conversing with us.","The grace of novelty and the length of habit, though so very opposite to one another, yet agree in this, that they both alike keepus from discovering the faults of our friends.","When we enlarge upon the affection our friends have for us, this is very often not so much out of a sense of gratitude as from a desire to persuade people of our own great worth, that can deserve so much kindness.","The boldest stroke and best act of friendship is not to disclose our own failings to a friend, but to show him his own.","As uncommon a thing as true love is, it is yet easier to find than true friendship.","The reason we do not let our friends see the very bottom of our hearts is not so much distrust of them as distrust of ourselves.","The thing that makes our friendships so short and changeable is that the qualities and dispositions of the soul are very hard to know, and those of the understanding and wit very easy.","Truth has scarce done so much good in the world as the false appearances of it have done hurt.","When the philosophers despised riches, it was because they had a mind to vindicate their own merit, and take revenge upon the injustice of fortune by vilifying those enjoyments which she had not given them.","The fondness or indifference that the philosophers expressed for life was merely a preference inspired by their self-love, and will no more bear reasoning upon than the relish of the palate or the choice of colors.","The distempers of the soul have their relapses, as many and as dangerous as those of the body; and what we take for a perfect cureis generally either an abatement of the same disease or the changing of that for another.","We should desire very few things passionately if we did but perfectly know the nature of the things we desire.","Idleness and constancy fix the mind to what it finds easy and agreeable. This habit always confines and cramps up our knowledge; and no one has ever taken the trouble to stretch and carry his understanding as far as it could go.","It is necessary, in order to know things well, to know the particulars of them; and these, being infinite, make our knowledge eversuperficial and imperfect.","Some follies are caught, like contagious diseases.","Our self-love can less bear to have our tastes than our opinions condemned.","Women can more easily conquer their passion than their coquetterie.","He that fancies such a sufficiency in himself that he can live without all the world is greatly mistaken; but he that imagines himself so necessary that other people cannot live without him is a great deal more mistaken.","We often make use of envenomed praise, that reveals on the rebound, as it were, defects in those praised which we dare not exposeany other way.","That man, we may be sure, is a person of true worth, whom those who envy him most are yet forced to praise.","Criticism sometimes is really praise, and praise sometimes slander.","Praise is a more ingenious, concealed, and subtle kind of flattery, that satisfies both the giver and the receiver, though by verydifferent ways. The one accepts it as a reward due to his merit; the other gives it that he may be looked upon as a just and discerning person.","Very few people are acquainted with death. They undergo it, commonly, not so much out of resolution as custom and insensitivity; and most men die because they cannot help it.","We often see malefactors, when they are led to execution, put on resolution and a contempt of death which, in truth, is nothing else but fearing to look it in the face--so that this pretended bravery may very truly be said to do the same good office to their mind that the blindfold does to their eyes.","Those great and glorious actions that dazzle our eyes with their luster are represented by statesmen as the result of great wisdomand excellent design; whereas, in truth, they are commonly the effects of the humors and passions.","When the soul is ruffled by the remains of one passion, it is more disposed to entertain a new one than when it is entirely curedand at rest from all.","It is a mighty error to suppose that none but violent and strong passions, such as love and ambition, are able to vanquish the rest. Even idleness, as feeble and languishing as it is, sometimes reigns over them; it usurps the throne and sits paramount over all the designs and actions of our lives, and imperceptibly wastes and destroys all our passions and all our virtues.","Men never desire anything very eagerly which they desire only by the dictates of reason.","The heart of man ever finds a constant succession of passions, so that the destroying and pulling down of one proves generally tobe nothing else but the production and the setting up of another.","The passions do very often give birth to others of a nature most contrary to their own. Thus avarice sometimes brings forth prodigality, and prodigality avarice; a man\'s resolution is very often the effect of levity, and his boldness that of cowardice and fear.","The same strength of character which helps a man resist love, helps to make it more violent and lasting too. People of unsettled minds are always driven about with passions, but never absolutely filled with any.","There is a sort of love whose very excessiveness prevents the lover\'s being jealous.","Even the most disinterested love is, after all, but a kind of bargain, in which self-love always proposes to be the gainer one wayor another.","Unfaithfulness ought to extinguish love, and we should not be jealous when there is reason to be. Only those who give no grounds for jealousy are worthy of it.","A man is sometimes better off deceived about the one he loves, than undeceived.","Considering how little the beginning or the ceasing to love is in our own power, it is foolish and unreasonable for the lover or his mistress to complain of one another\'s inconstancy.","Constancy in love is a perpetual inconstancy which fixes our hearts successively to all the qualities of the person loved--sometimes admiring one and sometimes another above all the rest--so that this constancy roves as far as it can, and is no better than inconstancy, confined within the compass of one person.","Constancy in love is of two sorts: One is the effect of new excellencies that are always presenting themselves afresh, and attractour affections continually; the other is only from a point of honor, and a taking of pride not to change.","Love has its name borrowed by a great number of dealings and affairs that are attributed to it--in which it has no greater part than the Doge in what is done at Venice.","Love is one and the same in the original; but there are a thousand different copies of it.","A man\'s wits are better employed in bearing up under the misfortunes that lie upon him at present than in foreseeing those that may come upon him hereafter.","Silence is the best security to the man who distrusts himself.","Moderation is represented as a virtue in order to restrain the ambition of great men, and to console those of a meaner condition in their lesser merit and fortune.","What we take for high-mindedness is very often no other than ambition well disguised, that scorns means interests, only to pursuegreater.","The cunningest dissimulation is when a man pretends to be caught in the traps others set for him; and a man is never so easily over-reached as when he is contriving to over-reach others.","Men are inconsolable concerning the treachery of their friends or the deceptions of their enemies; and yet they are often very highly satisfied to be both deceived and betrayed by their own selves.","The most effectual way to be deceived is to believe oneself more cunning than one\'s neighbors.","The most ingenious men continually pretend to condemn tricking--but this is often done that they may use it more conveniently themselves, when some great occasion or interest offers itself to them.","We are much mistaken if we think that men are always brave from a principle of valor, or women chaste from a principle of modesty.","Moderation is a fear of falling into that envy and contempt which those who grow giddy with their good fortune quite justly draw upon themselves. It is a vain boasting of the greatness of our mind.","There is something to be said for jealousy, because it only designs the preservation of some good which we either have or think wehave a right to. But envy is a raging madness that cannot bear the wealth or fortune of others.","It is sometimes a point of as much cleverness to know to make good use of advice from others as to be able give good advice to oneself.","One man may be more cunning than another, but no one can be more cunning than all the world.","Perseverance is neither praiseworthy nor blameworthy; for it seems to be only the enduring of certain inclinations and opinions which men neither give themselves nor take away from themselves.","Our repentances are generally not so much a concern and remorse for the harm we have done, as a fear of the harm we may have brought upon ourselves.","That which occasions so many mistakes in the computations of men, when they expect return for favors, is that the giver\'s pride and the receiver\'s cannot agree upon the value of the kindness done.","We frequently are troublesome to others, when we think it impossible for us ever to be so.","The applause we give those who are new to society often proceeds from a secret envying of those already established.","A man seldom finds people unthankful, as long as he remains in a condition of benefiting them further.","It is safer to do most men harm than to do them too much good.","A man is ridiculous less through the characteristics he has than through those he affects to have.","Commonplace minds usually condemn what is beyond the reach of their understanding.","Some disguised deceits counterfeit truth so perfectly that not to be taken in by them would be an error of judgment.","We exaggerate the glory of some men in order to detract from that of others.","We are always bored by the very people by whom it is vital not to be bored.","Happiness does not consist in things themselves but in the relish we have of them.","Without humility, we keep all our defects; and they are only crusted over by pride, which conceals them from others, and often from ourselves.","It is easier to fall in love when you are out of it than to get out of it when you are in.","We are never so generous as when giving advice.","Virtue is to the soul what health is tot he body.","It is not always for virtue\'s sake that women are virtuous.","Our hopes, often though they deceive us, lead us pleasantly along the path of life.","In friendship, as in love, we are often more happy from the things we are ignorant of than from those we are acquainted with.","A woman often thinks she regrets the lover, when she only regrets the love.","Absence abates a moderate passion and intensifies a great one - as the wind blows out a candle but fans fire into flame.","Consolation for unhappiness can often be found in a certain satisfaction we get from looking unhappy.","He who refuses praise the first time that it is offered does so because he would hear it a second time.","Humility is often only a feigned submissiveness by which men hope to bring other people to submit to them; it is a more calculated sort of pride.","If you cannot find peace in yourself, it is useless to look for it elsewhere.","Loyalty is in most people only a ruse used by self-interest to attract confidence.","Plenty of people want to be pious, but no one yearns to be humble.","We are eager to believe that others are flawed because we are eager to believe in what we wish for.","There are many predicaments in life that one must be a bit crazy to escape from.","We confess to little faults only to persuade ourselves we have no great ones.","There are few people more convinced of their own genius than those who complain of how stupid they are.","We should not be upset that others hide the truth from us, when we hide it so often from ourselves.","One kind of happiness is to know exactly at what point to be miserable.","Men have written in the most convincing manner to prove that death is no evil, and this opinion has been confirmed on a thousand celebrated occasions by the weakest of men as well as by heroes. Even so I doubt whether any sensible person has ever believed it, and the trouble men take to convince others as well as themselves that they do shows clearly that it is no easy undertaking.","If it were not for poetry, few men would ever fall in love.","The most clever and polite are content with only seeming attentive while we perceive in their mind and eyes that at the very time they are wandering from what is said and desire to return to what they want to say.","It is oftener by the estimation of our own feelings that we exaggerate the good qualities of others than by their merit, and when we praise them we wish to attract their praise.","Moderation is caused by the fear of exciting the envy and contempt which those merit who are intoxicated with their good fortune; it is a vain display of our strength of mind, and in short the moderation of men at their greatest height is only a desire to appear greater than their fortune.","Those who are condemned to death affect sometimes a constancy and contempt for death which is only the fear of facing it; so that one may say that this constancy and contempt are to their mind what the bandage is to their eyes.","When great men permit themselves to be cast down by the continuance of misfortune, they show us that they were only sustained by ambition, and not by their mind; so that PLUS a great vanity, heroes are made like other men.","People are often vain of their passions, even of the worst, but envy is a passion so timid and shame-faced that no one ever dare avow her.","Jealousy is in a manner just and reasonable, as it tends to preserve a good which belongs, or which we believe belongs to us, on the other hand envy is a fury which cannot endure the happiness of others.","Pride indemnifies itself and loses nothing even when it casts away vanity.","We have not enough strength to follow all our reason.","The caprice of our temper is even more whimsical than that of Fortune.","The contempt of riches in philosophers was only a hidden desire to avenge their merit upon the injustice of fortune, by despising the very goods of which fortune had deprived them; it was a secret to guard themselves against the degradation of poverty, it was a back way by which to arrive at that distinction which they could not gain by riches.","A man is perhaps ungrateful, but often less chargeable with ingratitude than his benefactor is.","We are deceived if we think that mind and judgment are two different matters: judgment is but the extent of the light of the mind. This light penetrates to the bottom of matters; it remarks all that can be remarked, and perceives what appears imperceptible. Therefore we must agree that it is the extent of the light in the mind that produces all the effects which we attribute to judgment.","Everyone praises his heart, none dare praise their understanding.","Men and things have each their proper perspective; to judge rightly of some it is necessary to see them near, of others we can never judge rightly but at a distance.","A man for whom accident discovers sense, is not a rational being. A man only is so who understands, who distinguishes, who tests it.","One kind of flirtation is to boast we never flirt.","The most subtle of our acts is to simulate blindness for snares that we know are set for us.","We often act treacherously more from weakness than from a fixed motive.","The smallest fault of women who give themselves up to love is to love.","A man would rather say evil of himself than say nothing.","Praise is flattery, artful, hidden, delicate, which gratifies differently him who praises and him who is praised. The one takes it as the reward of merit, the other bestows it to show his impartiality and knowledge.","We often select envenomed praise which, by a reaction upon those we praise, shows faults we could not have shown by other means.","Few are sufficiently wise to prefer censure which is useful to praise which is treacherous.","The desire which urges us to deserve praise strengthens our good qualities, and praise given to wit, valour, and beauty, tends to increase them.","There are persons whose only merit consists in saying and doing stupid things at the right time, and who ruin all if they change their manners.","If one acts rightly and honestly, it is difficult to decide whether it is the effect of integrity or skill.","The evil that we do does not attract to us so much persecution and hatred as our good qualities.","Our distrust of another justifies his deceit.","Instead of considering that the worst way to persuade or please others is to try thus strongly to please ourselves, and that to listen well and to answer well are some of the greatest charms we can have in conversation.","The hate of favourites is only a love of favour. The envy of NOT possessing it, consoles and softens its regrets by the contempt it evinces for those who possess it, and we refuse them our homage, not being able to detract from them what attracts that of the rest of the world.","Neither love nor fire can subsist without perpetual motion; both cease to live so soon as they cease to hope, or to fear.","What renders us so changeable in our friendship is, that it is difficult to know the qualities of the soul, but easy to know those of the mind.","We often persuade ourselves to love people who are more powerful than we are, yet interest alone produces our friendship; we do not give our hearts away for the good we wish to do, but for that we expect to receive.","The daily employment of cunning marks a little mind, it generally happens that those who resort to it in one respect to protect themselves lay themselves open to attack in another.","Too great cleverness is but deceptive delicacy, true delicacy is the most substantial cleverness.","Fortune turns all things to the advantage of those on whom she smiles.","There is real love just as there are real ghosts; every person speaks of it, few persons have seen it.","Everyone blames his memory, no one blames his judgment.","The largest ambition has the least appearance of ambition when it meets with an absolute impossibility in compassing its object.","Absence diminishes small loves and increases great ones, as the wind blows out the candle and fans the bonfire.","If we had no faults we should not take so much pleasure in noting those of others.","We are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others, that in the end, we become disguised to ourselves.","True love is like ghosts, which everybody talks about and few have seen.","Our envy always lasts longer than the happiness of those we envy.","Hypocrisy is a tribute that vice pays to virtue.","The truest way to be deceived is to think oneself more knowing than others.","Almost all our faults are more pardonable than the methods we resort to to hide them.","Everyone complains of his memory, and no one complains of his judgment.","How can you expect another to keep a secret if we have been unable to keep it ourselves?","Before we set our hearts too much upon anything, let us examine how happy those are who already possess it.","We would often be ashamed of our best actions if the world only knew the motives behind them.","It is with true love as with ghosts and apparitions: Every one talks of it, and scarcely any one has seen it","We forgive so long as we love.","If we had no faults of our own, we would not take so much pleasure in noticing those of others.","How rare true love maybe, it is less so than true friendship.","It is more shameful to distrust one\'s friends than to be deceived by them","In jealousy there is more of self-love than love","Passion often makes a madman of the cleverest man, and renders the greatest fools clever.","He who lives without folly is not as wise as he may think.","All passions make us commit faults, but love makes us commit the most ridiculous ones.","We all have strength enough to endure the misfortunes of others.","We always like those who admire us; we do not always like those whom we admire","Our virtues are most frequently but vices disguised.","Sometimes we are less unhappy in being deceived by those we love, than in being undecieved by them.","357.\u2014Little minds are too much wounded by little things; great minds see all and are not even hurt.","Some beautiful things are more impressive when left imperfect than when than when too highly finished","Almost always we are bored by people to whom we ourselves are boring.","A weakling is incapable of sincerity.","Absense diminishes small loves and increases great ones, as the wind blows out the candle and blows up the bonfire.","The defects and faults of the mind are like wounds in the body. After all imaginable care has been taken to heal them up, still there will be a scar left behind.","142.\u2014As it is the mark of great minds to say many things in a few words, so it is that of little minds to use many words to say nothing.","We do not despise all those with vices, but we do despise all those without a single virtue.","There is only one kind of love, but there are a thousand different versions.","321.\u2014We are nearer loving those who hate us, than those who love us more than we desire.","78.\u2014The love of justice is simply in the majority of men the fear of suffering injustice.","269.\u2014No man is clever enough to know all the evil he does.","93.\u2014Old men delight in giving good advice as a consolation for the fact that they can no longer set bad examples.","324.\u2014There is more self-love than love in jealousy.","437.\u2014We should not judge of a man\'s merit by his great abilities, but by the use he makes of them.","When not prompted by vanity, we say little.","How is it that our memory is good enough to retain the least triviality that happens to us, and yet not good enough to recollect how often we have told it to the same person? ~Fran\xe7ois Duc de La Rochefoucauld","267.\u2014A quickness in believing evil without having sufficiently examined it, is the effect of pride and laziness. We wish to find the guilty, and we do not wish to trouble ourselves in examining the crime.","How comes it that our memories are good enough to retain even the minutest details of what has befallen us, but not to recollect how many times we have recounted to the same person?","It is a great ability to be able to conceal one\'s ability.","It is a kind of happiness to know just how unhappy we could be.","103.\u2014Those who know their minds do not necessarily know their hearts.","386.\u2014No people are more often wrong than those who will not allow themselves to be wrong.","En la amistad como en el amor se es m\xe1s feliz por las cosas que se ignoran que por las que se saben\\".","The defects of the mind arelike the wounds of the body. Whatever care we take to heal them the scars ever remain, and there is always danger of their reopening.","It is much easier to extinguish a first desire than to satisfy all of those that follow it.","70.\u2014There is no disguise which can long hide love where it exists, nor feign it where it does not.","158.\u2014Flattery is base coin to which only our vanity gives currency.","We often forgive those who bore us, but we do not forgive those we bore.\u201d","Nothing so much prevents our being natural as the desire to seem so.","237.\u2014No one should be praised for his goodness if he has not strength enough to be wicked. All other goodness is but too often an idleness or powerlessness of will.","Virtues are lost in self interest as rivers are lost in the sea.","329.\u2014We believe, sometimes, that we hate flattery \u2014we only dislike the method.","We are often more treacherous through weakness than calculation","Nous avons plus de paresse dans l\'esprit que dans le corps.","409.\u2014We should often be ashamed of our very best actions if the world only saw the motives which caused them.","469.\u2014We never desire earnestly what we desire in reason.","On n\'est jamais si heureux ni si malheureux qu\'on s\'imagine.","The desire to be pitied or to be admired often forms the greater part of our confidence.","Les d\xe9fauts de l\'\xe2me sont comme les blessures du corps: quelque soin qu\'on prenne de les gu\xe9rir, la cicatrice para\xeet toujours, et elles sont \xe0 tout moment en danger de se rouvrir.","22.\u2014Philosophy triumphs easily over past evils and future evils; but present evils triumph over it.","Perfect valour is to do without witnesses whatone would do before all the world.","350.\u2014Why we hate with so much bitterness those who deceive us is because they think themselves more clever than we are.","356.\u2014Usually we only praise heartily those who admire us.","Nobody deserves to be praised for goodness unless he is strong enough to be bad.","Si nous r\xe9sistons \xe0 nos passions, c\'est plus par leur faiblesse que par notre force.","Orang yang mengira bisa hidup tapa orang lain berarti membohongi diri sendiri, tetapi mereka yang mengira orang-orang lain tidak bisa hidup tanpa dia lebih keliru lagi.","L\'esprit est toujours la dupe du coeur.","The only thing constant in life is change.","It is a great act of cleverness to conceal one\'s being clever.","19.\u2014We have all sufficient strength to support the misfortunes of others.","313.\u2014How is it that our memory is good enough to retain the least triviality that happens to us, and yet not good enough to recollect how often we have told it to the same person?","Nothing prevents us being natural so much as the desire to appear so.","433.\u2014The most certain sign of being born with great qualities is to be born without envy.

All other goodness is generally nothing but indolence or impotence of will.","31.\u2014If we had no faults we should not take so much pleasure in noting those of others.","Man is so wretched that, while directing all his conduct towards satisfying his passions, he constantly moans about their tyranny: he cannot bear their violence, nor the violence he must use against himself in order to free himself from their yoke; he finds them disgusting, but so too their remedies, and he cannot come to terms with the pain of his illness, nor with the labour necessary for a cure.","In their first passion women love their lovers, in all the others they love love.","To praise princes for virtues they do not possess is but to reproach them with impunity.","Wisdom is to the soul what health is to the body.","Virtue would not go so far if vanity did not keep it company.","248.\u2014Magnanimity despises all, to win all.","201.\u2014He who thinks he has the power to content the world greatly deceives himself, but he who thinks that the world cannot be content with him deceives himself yet more.","We promise according to our hopes; we perform according to our fears.","If we conquer our passions it is more from their weakness than from our strength.","It is impossible to love a second time those whom we have really ceased to love.","What we term virtue is often but a mass of various actions and diverse interests, which fortune, or our own industry, manage to arrange; and it is not always from valor or from chastity that men are brave, and women chaste.","95.\u2014The test of extraordinary merit is to see those who envy it the most yet obliged to praise it.","[\\"Ambition has been so strong as to make very miserable men take comfort that they were supreme in misery;","Nos vertus ne sont, le plus souvent, que de vices d\xe9guis\xe9s.","Where love is, no disguise can hide it for very long; where it is not, none can simulate it.","What we find the least of in flirtation is love.","463.\u2014There is often more pride than goodness in our grief for our enemies\' miseries; it is to show how superior we are to them, that we bestow on them the sign of our compassion.","However we distrust the sincerity of those whom we talk with, we always believe them more sincere with us than with others.","Women cannot be completely severe unless they hate.","En la adversidad de nuestros mejores amigos siempre encontramos algo que no nos desagrada","It is not enough to succeed; others must fail.","When we love too much it is difficult to discover when we have ceased to be beloved.","most men only die because they know not how to prevent dying.","We are always bored by those whom we bore.","390.\u2014We give up more easily our interest than our taste.","Great souls are not those who have fewer passions and more virtues than the common, but those only who have greater designs.","We are never so happy or so unhappy as we suppose.","It is far easier to be wise for others than to be so for oneself.","160.\u2014However brilliant an action it should not be esteemed great unless the result of a great motive.","315.\u2014What commonly hinders us from showing the recesses of our heart to our friends, is not the distrust we have of them, but that we have of ourselves.","Los defectos y faltas de la mente son como las heridas del cuerpo.
