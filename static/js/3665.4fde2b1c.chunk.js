Health is primarily that state in which these constituent substances are in the correct proportion to each other, both in strength and quantity, and are well mixed.","Fat people who want to reduce should take their exercise on an empty stomach and sit down to their food out of breath.... Thin people who want to get fat should do exactly the opposite and never take exercise on an empty stomach.","Any man who is intelligent must, on considering that health is of the utmost value to human beings, have the personal understanding necessary to help himself in diseases, and be able to understand and to judge what physicians say and what they administer to his body, being versed in each of these matters to a degree reasonable for a layman.","Declare the past,\\ndiagnose the present,\\nforetell the future.","It is better not to apply any treatment in cases of occult cancer; for if treated (by surgery), the patients die quickly; but if not treated, they hold out for a long time.","Healing in a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity.","Divine is the task to relieve pain","Your foods shall be your \'remedies,\' and your \'remedies\' shall be your foods.","Even when all is known, the care of a man is not yet complete, because eating alone will not keep a man well; he must also take exercise.

Through these come knowledge or lack of it.","Life is short, science is long; opportunity is elusive, experiment is dangerous, judgement is difficult.","Medicine in its present state is, it seems to me, by now completely discovered, insofar as it teaches in each instance the particular details and the correct measures. For anyone who has an understanding of medicine in this way depends very little upon good luck, but is able to do good with or without luck. For the whole of medicine has been established, and the excellent principles discovered in it clearly have very little need of good luck.","I swear... to hold my teacher in this art equal to my own parents; to make him partner in my livelihood; when he is in need of money to share mine with him; to consider his family as my own brothers and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it, without fee or indenture.","I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion.","Correct is to recognize what diseases are and whence they come; which are long and which are short; which are mortal and which are not; which are in the process of changing into others; which are increasing and which are diminishing; which are major and which are minor; to treat the diseases that can be treated, but to recognize the ones that cannot be, and to know why they cannot be; by treating patients with the former, to give them the benefit of treatment as far as it is possible.","It is changes that are chiefly responsible for diseases, especially the greatest changes, the violent alterations both in the seasons and in other things. (:)...regimen and temperature, and one period of life to another.","Time is that wherein there is opportunity, and opportunity is that wherein there is no great time.","The body of man has in itself blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile; these make up the nature of this body, and through these he feels pain or enjoys health. Now he enjoys the most perfect health when these elements are duly proportioned to one another in respect of compounding, power and bulk, and when they are perfectly mingled.","If for the sake of a crowded audience you do wish to hold a lecture, your ambition is no laudable one, and at least avoid all citations from the poets, for to quote them argues feeble industry.","Life is short, the art long.","For where there is love of man, there is also love of the art.","Timidity betrays want of powers, and audacity a want of skill. There are, indeed, two things, knowledge and opinion, of which the one makes its possessor really to know, the other to be ignorant.","For extreme diseases, extreme methods of cure, as to restriction, are most suitable.","Men ought to know that from the brain, and from the brain only, arise our pleasures, joy, laughter and jests, as well as our sorrows, pains, griefs, and tears.","There are some arts which to those that possess them are painful, but to those that use them are helpful, a common good to laymen, but to those that practise them grievous. Of such arts there is one which the Greeks call medicine.

It is not, in my opinion, any more divine or more sacred that other diseases, but has a natural cause, and its supposed divine origin is due to men\'s inexperience, and to their wonder at its peculiar character.","The art is long, life is short","Those things which are sacred, are to be imparted only to sacred persons; and it is not lawful to import them to the profane until they have been initiated in the mysteries of the science.","Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.","There are in fact two things, science and opinion; the former begets knowledge, the latter ignorance.","Declare the past, diagnose the present, foretell the future.","As to diseases, make a habit of two things \u2014 to help, or at least, to do no harm.","Ars longa,vita brevis,occasio praeceps,experimentum periculosum,iudicium difficile.Life is short,[the] art long,opportunity fleeting,experiment dangerous,judgment difficult.","People think that epilepsy is divine simply because they don\'t have any idea what causes epilepsy.
