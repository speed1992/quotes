One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky his is to have you....The one who turns to his friends and says, \'that\'s her.\'","History is filled with brilliant people who wanted to fix things and just made them worse.","We all die. The goal isn\'t to live forever, the goal is to create something that will.","Are these things really better than the things I already have? Or am I just trained to be dissatisfied with what I have now?","Your past is just a story. And once you realize this it has no power over you.","Stop trying to control everything and just let go! LET GO!","If you don\'t know what you want, you end up with a lot you don\'t.","People don\'t want their lives fixed. Nobody wants their problems solved. Their dramas. Their distractions. Their stories resolved. Their messed cleaned up. Because what would they have left? Just the big scary unknown.","You have a class of young strong men and women, and they want to give their lives to something. Advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don\'t need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don\'t really need. We don\'t have a great war in our generation, or a great depression, but we do, we have a great war of the spirit. We have a great revolution against the culture. The great depression is our lives. We have a spiritual depression.","The unreal is more powerful than the real. Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. Because its only intangible ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. Wood rots. People, well, they die. But things as fragile as a thought, a dream, a legend, they can go on and on. If you can change the way people think. The way they see themselves. The way they see the world. You can change the way people live their lives. That\'s the only lasting thing you can create.","A good story should change the way you see the world.","Real smarts begin when you quit quoting other people.","Big Brother isn\'t watching. He\'s singing and dancing. He\'s pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big Brother\'s busy holding your attention every moment you\'re awake. He\'s making sure you\'re always distracted. He\'s making sure you\'re fully absorbed. He\'s making sure your imagination withers. Until it\'s as useful as your appendix. He\'s making sure your attention is always filled. And this being fed, it\'s worse than being watched. With the world always filling you, no one has to worry about what\'s in your mind. With everyone\'s imagination atrophied, no one will ever be a threat to the world.","Yes, terrible things happen, but sometimes those terrible things - they save you.","Don\'t do what you want. Do what you don\'t want. Do what you\'re trained not to want. Do the things that scare you the most.","This is your life and its ending one moment at a time.","If you can change the way people think. The way they see themselves. The way they see the world. If you do that, you can change the way people live their lives. That\'s the only lasting thing you can create.","The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person.","May I never be complete. May I never be content. May I never be perfect.","I would say any behavior that is not the status quo is interpreted as insanity, when, in fact, it might actually be enlightenment. Insanity is sorta in the eye of the beholder.","You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you\'re satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you\'ve got your sofa issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The drapes. The rug. Then you\'re trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.","You\'re always haunted by the idea you\'re wasting your life.","All the effort in the world won\'t matter if you\'re not inspired.","What makes earth feel like hell is our expectation that it should feel like heaven.","There\'s an opposite to d\xe9j\xe0 vu. They call it jamais vu. It\'s when you meet the same people or visit places, again and again, but each time is the first. Everybody is always a stranger. Nothing is ever familiar.","Actually, watching television and surfing the Internet are really excellent practice for being dead.","We\'ve spent so much time judging what other people created that we\'ve created very, very little of our own.","Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I\'ve ever known.","Have your adventures, make your mistakes, and choose your friends poorly -- all these make for great stories.","There are only patterns, patterns on top of patterns, patterns that affect other patterns. Patterns hidden by patterns. Patterns within patterns. If you watch close, history does nothing but repeat itself. What we call chaos is just patterns we haven\'t recognized. What we call random is just patterns we can\'t decipher. what we can\'t understand we call nonsense. What we can\'t read we call gibberish. There is no free will. There are no variables.","We can spend our lives letting the world tell us who we are\u2026Or we can decide for ourselves.","When did the future switch from being a promise to a threat?","I don\'t know the difference between what I want and what I\'m trained to want.","Did perpetual happiness in the Garden of Eden maybe get so boring that eating the apple was justified?","Because nothing is as good as you can imagine it. No one is as beautiful as she is in your head. Nothing is as exciting as your fantasy.","Having nothing to lose is the new wealth.","When you\'re an addict, you can go without feeling anything except drunk or stoned or hungry. Still, when you compare this to other feelings, to sadness, anger, fear, worry, despair, and depression, well, an addiction no longer looks so bad. It looks like a very viable option.","Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it\'s your responsibility to love it, or change it.","In truth, the degree of anyone\'s success depends on how often they can say the word yes and hear the word no.","If you worry about disaster all the time, that\'s what you\'re going to get.","I don\'t want to die without any scars.","People don\'t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk.","It\'s so hard to forget pain, but it\'s even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace.","Just for the record, the weather today is calm and sunny, but the air is full of bullshit.","Maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves.","I let go. Lost in oblivion. Dark and silent and complete. I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom.","A good story should make you laugh, and a moment later break your heart.","your handwriting. the way you walk. which china pattern you choose. it\'s all giving you away. everything you do shows your hand. everything is a self portrait. everything is a diary.","The first step - especially for young people with energy and drive and talent, but not money - the first step to controlling your world is to control your culture. To model and demonstrate the kind of world you demand to live in. To write the books. Make the music. Shoot the films. Paint the art.","To some of us, the nights are too long. To some, the days.","What I want is to be needed. What I need is to be indispensable to somebody. Who I need is somebody that will eat up all my free time, my ego, my attention. Somebody addicted to me. A mutual addiction.","When you understand, that what you\'re telling is just a story. It isn\'t happening anymore. When you realize the story you\'re telling is just words, when you can just crumble up and throw your past in the trashcan, then we\'ll figure out who you\'re going to be.","Emotionally, in our minds, we get so filled with resentments where we\'ve got a story about absolutely everything.","The problem with educating stupid people was that they didn\u2019t know they were stupid. The same went for curing crazy people.","If you knew that your life was merely a phase or short, short segment of your entire existence, how would you live? Knowing nothing \'real\' was at risk, what would you do? You\'d live a gigantic, bold, fun, dazzling life. You know you would. That\'s what the ghosts want us to do - all the exciting things they no longer can.","People have to really suffer before they can risk doing what they love.","Your birth is a mistake you\'ll spend your whole life trying to correct.","We can spend our lives letting the world tell us who we are. Sane or insane. Saints or sex addicts. Heroes or victims. Letting history tell us how good or bad we are. Letting our past decide our future. Or we can decide for ourselves. And maybe it\'s our job to invent something better.","By the time you read this, you\'ll be older than you remember.","Books can create a depth of story, a background of information and ideas, that televison and movies can\'t. Sure, the television shows may shock, but only on a superficial level. They\'d never risk market share to really explore the issues. They report, but don\'t analyze or suggest any new ways for living our lives.","The difference between how you look and how you see yourself is enough to kill most people. And maybe the reason vampires don\u2019t die is because they can never see themselves in photographs or mirrors.","If you haven\'t already noticed, all my books are about a lonely person looking for some way to connect with other people.In a way, that is the opposite of the American Dream: to get so rich you can rise above the rabble, all those people on the freeway or, worse, the bus.","The answer is there is no answer.","Parenthood is the opiate of the masses.","Carl Jung called this his shadow work. He said we never see others. Instead we see only aspects of ourselves that fall over them. Shadows. Projections. Our associations.","I say never be complete, I say stop being perfect, I say let... lets evolve, let the chips fall where they may.","In a world where billions believe their deity conceived a mortal child with a virgin human, it\'s stunning how little imagination most people display.","Maybe self-improvement isn\'t the answer, maybe self-destruction is the answer.","We live and we die and anything else is just a delusion.","The only thing that separates us from the animals... is we have pornography.","You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You\'re the same decaying organic matter as everything else.","We come from a generation of people who need their TV or stereo playing all the time. These people so scared of silence. These soundaholics, these quietophobics.","Every masterpiece is just dirt and ash put together in some perfect way.","If you love something set it free, but don\'t be surprised if it comes back with herpes.","You ever wonder if Adam and Eve were just the puppies God dumped because they wouldn\'t house-train?","Our real discoveries come from chaos, from going to the place that looks wrong and stupid and foolish.","Every woman is just a different kind of problem.","The only reason why we ask other people how their weekend was is so we can tell them about our own weekend.","Which is worse, hell or nothing?","Everyone holds a certain type of power. For young people, it\'s their youth, their attractiveness, and their energy. But they\'re terrified that as those qualities fade, what are they going to replace that form of power with?","What people forget is a journey to nowhere starts with a single step, too.","It only takes one mistake and nothing else you ever do will matter. No matter how hard you work or how smart you become, you\'ll always be known for that one poor choice.","No, none of us seem so very real. We\'re only supporting characters in the lives of each other. Any real truth, any precious fact will always be lost in a mountain of shattered make-believe.","This was freedom. Losing all hope was freedom.","The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up.","Sometimes the very best way to deal with unpleasant things is to depict them in ways that allow people to laugh at them and destroy the power of unsayable things, rather than refusing to acknowledge them.","It\'s easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will reject you or die.","Nothing feels as awful as pouring your heart out to some talk therapist, then realizing this so-called professional is actually vastly stupid and you\'ve just professed your most secret secrets to some goon who\'s wearing one brown sock and one blue sock.","What I\'m always trying to do with every book is to recreate the effect of the stories we heard as children in front of campfires and fireplaces - the ghost stories that engaged us.","Some of us are lucky enough to fall in love once or twice but the luckiest of us are those who find that someone they simply can\'t live without and have the pleasure of falling in love with them day in and day out for the rest of their lives. Relationships aren\'t about simply falling in love once and being done with it, they\'re about loving someone until the end of your days and growing that love endlessly.","Las Vegas looks the way you\'d imagine heaven must look at night.","You realize you have no control over how you\'re perceived.","On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.","We\'re all going overnight express delivery straight to Hell.","I admire addicts. In a world where everybody is waiting for some blind, random disaster or some sudden disease, the addict has the comfort of knowing what will most likely wait for him down the road. He\'s taken some control over his ultimate fate, and his addiction keeps the cause of his death from being a total surprise.","If the living are haunted by the dead, then the dead are haunted by their own mistakes.","There\'s a big difference between \\"not caring\\" or being \\"nihilistic\\" about a topic and simply not being enrolled by the drama presented by other people. Just because my characters choose not to react in standard, socially-appropriate ways - that does not mean they don\'t care. They just reject ordinary dramas.","You become smart when you don\'t need to quote someone anymore.\\" I am still stupid: I quoted Chuck Palahiniuk","It\'s creepy, but here we are, the Pilgrims, the crackpots of our time, trying to establish our own alternate reality. To build a world out of rocks and chaos. What it\'s going to be, I don\'t know. Even after all that rushing around, where we\'ve ended up is the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. And maybe knowing isn\'t the point. Where we\'re standing right now, in the ruins in the dark, what we build could be anything.","It\'s pathetic how we can\'t live with the things we can\'t understand. How we need everything labeled and explained and deconstructed.","The world will always punish the few people with special talents the rest of us don\u2019t recognize as real.","People didn\'t know who I was or why I was there, so they started inventing stories about me. I was a registered sex offender and I\'d just been released from prison and was being forced to do community-service work. I was a murderer, an arsonist - all these horrific things had been projected on me because no one knew what to make of this white guy who showed up and made toast at 5 o\'clock every morning.","If death meant just leaving the stage long enough to change costume and come back as a new character, would you slow down? Or speed up?","No matter how many luxuries you get, something will be missing. No matter how carefully you choose, you\'ll never be totally happy.","It\'s the Marilyn Monroe school of medicine where enough of any drug will cure any disease.","What they don\'t teach you in art school is how your whole life is about discovering who you already were.","Do you know why most survivors of the Holocaust are vegan? It\'s because they know what it\'s like to be treated like an animal.","If You Don\u2019t Claim Your Humanity, You Will Become A Statistic.","Intellectual culture seems to separate high art from low art. Low art is horror or pornography or anything that has a physical component to it and engages the reader on a visceral level and evokes a strong sympathetic reaction. High art is people driving in Volvos and talking a lot. I just don\'t want to keep those things separate. I think you can use visceral physical experiences to illustrate larger ideas, whether they\'re emotional or spiritual. I\'m trying to not exclude high and low art or separate them.","Angel says that rich people don\'t like to tolerate much. Money gives you permission to just walk away from everything that isn\'t pretty and perfect. You can\'t put up with anything less than lovely. You spend your life running, avoiding, escaping.","When nobody will look at you, you can stare a hole in them. Picking out all the little details you\'d never stare long enough to get if they\'d even just return your gaze, this, this is your revenge.","The laws that keep us safe, these same laws condemn us to boredom.","The damaged love the damaged. True fact.","Without animals, there would be no humanity. In a world of just people, people will mean nothing . . .","Think of spoiled cat food and ulcerated cankers and expired donor organs. That\'s how beautiful she looks.","You have a choice. Live or die. Every breath is a choice. Every minute is a choice. To be or not to be.","You couldn\'t have small, dying children in a movie without really bringing everyone down, but you can in comics.","First your parents, they give you your life, but then they try to give you their life.","I take pens and I write on the inside of my arm. When I\'m with people and somebody says a really fascinating anecdote, or fact, or phrase, I\'ll write it on the inside of my arm. At the end of the day, I\'ll take the very best things that are on my arm and I\'ll copy them into a notebook that I always carry and only when the weather is absolutely terrible will I really key the very best of that notebook into the computer. At that point, it\'s all sort of censored twice - only the best things go from the arm to the book and only the best things go from the book to the computer.","Because after you\'ve crossed some lines, you just keep crossing them. And there\'s no escaping from constant escape. Distracting ourselves. Avoiding confrontation. Getting past the moment. Jacking off. Television. Denial.","It\'s only in drugs or death we\'ll see anything new, and death is just too controlling.","When we die, these are the stories still on our lips. The stories we\u2019ll only tell strangers, someplace private in the padded cell of midnight. These important stories, we rehearse them for years in our head but never tell. These stories are ghosts, bringing people back from the dead. Just for a moment. For a visit. Every story is a ghost.","Everything is funnier in retrospect, funnier and prettier and cooler. You can laugh at anything from far enough away.","I always really curious to see how people interpret things. I know my version, and I\'m kind of bored with my version so I want to see their version.","There are the most fantastic, beautiful things and people out there. It\u2019s up to you to find them.","Without just one nest\\nA bird can call the world home\\nLife is your career","I\'m always identifying some fallacy in my own life. I\'m sort of making fun of myself by exploring and unpacking just why I\'m sort of automatically thrown to be a certain way.","You have endless ways you can commit suicide without dying dying.","This is how it is with insomnia. Everything is so far away, a copy of a copy of a copy. The insomnia distance of everything, you can\'t touch anything and nothing can touch you.","Worker bees can leave. Even drones can fly away. The Queen is their slave.","The government says Rant\'s alive because they need a villain. The kids say he\'s alive because they need a hero.","You tell yourself that noise is what defines silence. Without noise, silence would not be golden. Noise is the exception. Think of deep outer space, the incredible cold and quiet where your wife and kid wait. Silence, not heaven, would be reward enough.","Maybe the only thing each of us can see is our own shadow. Carl Jung called this his shadow work. He said we never see others. Instead we see only aspects of ourselves that fall over them. Shadows. Projections. Our associations. The same way old painters would sit in a tiny dark room and trace the image of what stood outside a tiny window, in the bright sunlight. The camera obscura. Not the exact image, but everything reversed or upside down.","I just don\'t want to die without a few scars.","Hey, even the Mona Lisa is falling apart.","The truth is, immigrants tend to be more American than people born here.","It\'s not love or anything, but I think I like you, too.","If I can\'t be beautiful, I want to be invisible.","There will always be an underground.","There\'s a moment in every book when the book turns and it surprises me.","I\'m not sure what we\'re running from. Nobody. Or the future. Fate. Growing up. Getting old. Picking up the pieces. As if running we won\'t have to get on with our lives.","I don\'t want to die without a few scars.","For years now, I\'ve wanted to fall asleep. The sort of slipping off, the giving up, the falling part of sleep. Now sleeping is the last thing I want to do.","Make me into anything, but just love me.","We\'re all trapped. It\'s always 1734. All of us, we\'re stuck in the same time capsule, the same as those television shows where the same people are marooned on the same desert island for thirty seasons and never age or escape. They just wear more makeup. In a creepy way, those shows are maybe too authentic.","She\'s not wearing makeup so her face just looks like skin.","My first time I jacked off, I thought I\'d invented it. I looked down at my sloppy handful of junk and thought, This is going to make me rich.","I haven\'t had a TV in 10 years, and I really don\'t miss it. \'Cause it\'s always so much more fun to be with people than it ever was to be with a television.","Parents are like God because you wanna know they\'re out there, and you want them to think well of you, but you really only call when you need something.","In the big factory of perfecting human souls, the Earth was kind of tumbler. The sale as the kind people use to polish rocks. All souls come here to rub the sharp edges off each other. This isn\'t suffering. It\'s erosion.","I\'ve met God across his long walnut desk with his diplomas hanging on the wall behind him, and God asks me, \'Why?\' Why did I cause so much pain? Didn\'t I realize that each of us is a sacred, unique snowflake of special unique specialness? Can\'t I see how we\'re all manifestations of love? I look at God behind his desk, taking notes on a pad, but God\'s got this all wrong. We are not special. We are not crap or trash, either. We just are. We just are, and what happens just happens. And God says, \'No, that\'s not right.\' Yeah. Well. Whatever. You can\'t teach God anything.","Game shows are designed to make us feel better about the random, useless facts that are all we have left of our education.","I wish I had the courage not to fight and doubt everything... I wish, just once, I could say, \'This. This is good enough. Just because I choose it.","The things you used to own, now they own you.","Tyler lies back and asks, \\"If Marilyn Monroe were alive right now, what would she be doing?\\" I say, goodnight. The headliner hangs down in shreds from the ceiling and Tyler says, \\"Clawing at the lid of her coffin.","The joke is, we all have the same punchline.","You gain power by pretending to be weak.","You have a choice. Live or die. Every breath is a choice. Every minute is a choice. Every time you don\'t throw yourself down the stairs, that\'s a choice. Every time you don\'t crash your car, you re-enlist.","Art never comes from happiness.","Picture anybody growing up so stupid he didn\'t know that hope is just another phase you\'ll grow out of.","You realize that people take drugs because it\'s the only real personal adventure left to them in their time-constrained, law-and-order, property-lined world. It\'s only in drugs or death we\'ll see anything new, and death is just too controlling.","It can only take a moment to waste the rest of your life.","Does it hurt very much to die? Well, sweetheart, yes, but it hurts a lot more to keep living.","Just for the record, she still loves you. She wouldn\'t bother to torture you if she didn\'t.","How much can you know about yourself if you\'ve never been in a fight?","Anything you can aquire is only another thing you\'ll lose.","Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don\'t really need.","Nevertheless, if you ask me, most people have children just as their own enthusiasm about life begins to wane. A child allows us to revisit the excitement we once felt about, well... everything. A generation later, our grandkids bump up our enthusiasm yet again. Reproducing is a kind of booster shot to keep us loving life.","Someone bent on suicide won\'t have much sense of humor left.","If you ask me, most people have children just as their own enthusiasm about life begins to wane.","No matter how bad things get, you can still walk away.","Scratch any fortune and you\'ll find blood only a generation or two back...child labor in mines or mills...Slavery. Drugs. Stock swindles. Wasting nature with clear-cuts, pollution, harvesting to extinction. Monopolies. Disease. War. Every fortune comes out of something unpleasant.","Regret, Daisy knew, was the only confirmation of a well-lived life. If you didn\'t occasionally go too far, you weren\'t going anywhere.","The voice says, maybe you don\'t go to hell for the things you do. Maybe you go to hell for the things you don\'t do. The things you don\'t finish.","Since change is constant, you wonder if people crave death because it\'s the only way they can get anything really finished.","Ideas come at any moment -- except when you demand them. Most ideas come while I\'m physically active, at the gym, with friends, gardening, so I always carry pen and paper. My first draft is always written in longhand. But once the first dozen chapters, more like short stories, are written, then momentum builds until I can\'t leave the project until it\'s done.","Why do I do anything?\' she says. \'I\'m educated enough to talk myself out of any plan. To deconstruct any fantasy. Explain away any goal. I\'m so smart I can negate any dream.","For the record, knowing when people are only pretending to like you isn\'t such a great skill to have.","People are all over the world telling their one dramatic story and how their life has turned into getting over this one event. Now their lives are more about the past than their future.","Big Brother isn\u2019t watching. He\u2019s singing and dancing. He\u2019s pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big Brother\u2019s busy holding your attention every moment you\u2019re awake. He\u2019s making sure you\u2019re always distracted. He\u2019s making sure you\u2019re fully absorbed.","Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.","Only after disaster can we be resurrected. It\'s only after you\'ve lost everything that you\'re free to do anything. Nothing is static, everything is evolving, everything is falling apart.","Brandy is so attractive you could chop her head off and put it on blue velvet in the window at Tiffany\'s and somebody would buy it for a million dollars.","The best fights don\'t occur between strangers. They occur between friends who trust each other.","You cannot be the person they know and the great, glorious person you want to become. Not at the same time.","You see, life only turns out good or bad for only a little bit. And then it turns out some other way.","When you reach the end of your life - trust me, you won\'t look back and savor the moments you spent alone.","The avant-garde in every field consists of the lonely, the friendless, the uninvited. All progress is the product of the unpopular.","People had been working for so many years to make the world a safe organized place. Nobody realized how boring it would become.","What do you do when your entire identity is destroyed in an instant? How do you cope when your whole life story turns out to bw wrong?","How you\'re still always trapped. How your head is the cave, your eyes the cave mouth. How you live inside your head and only see what you want. How you only watch the shadows and make up your own meaning.","Love is bullshit. Emotion is bullshit. I am a rock. A jerk. I\'m an uncaring asshole and proud of it.","I am Jack\'s complete lack of surprise. I am Jack\'s Broken Heart.","We thought all this teaching was to make us smart. What it did was make us stupid. With all the little facts we learned, we never had the time to think.","Find out what you\'re afraid of and go live there.","The lower you fall, the higher you\'ll fly.","You can\'t base your life on the past or the present. You have to tell me about your future.","Personal identity seems like it\'s just such an American archetype, from Holly Golightly re-inventing herself in \'Breakfast At Tiffany\'s\' to Jay Gatsby in \'The Great Gatsby.\' It seems like the sort of archetypal American issue. If you\'re given the freedom to be anything, or be anyone, what do you do with it?","I want you to invent it. I want you to have that skill. To create your own reality. Your own set of laws. I want to try and teach you that.","If it comes down to a choice between being unloved and being vulnerable and sensitive and emotional, then you can just keep your love.","Everything is a self-portrait. A diary. Your whole drug history\u2019s in a strand of your hair. Your fingernails. The forensic details. The lining of your stomach is a document. The calluses on your hand tell all your secrets. Your teeth give you away. Your accent. The wrinkles around your mouth and eyes. Everything you do shows your hand.","I see the strongest and the smartest men who have ever lived... and these men are pumping gas and waiting tables.","All God does is watch us and kill us when we get boring. We must never, ever be boring.","Recycling and speed limits are bullshit. They\'re like someone who quits smoking on his deathbed.","Ask yourself: What did I eat for breakfast today? What did I eat for dinner last night? You see how fast reality fades away?","By the time you\'re thirty, your worst enemy is yourself.","Most people would never admit it, but they\'d been bitching since they were born. As soon as their head popped out into that bright delivery-room light, nothing had been right. Nothing had been as comfortable or felt so good. Just the effort it took to keep your stupid physical body alive, just finding food and cooking it and dishwashing, the keeping warm and bathing and sleeping, the walking and bowel movements and ingrown hairs, it was all getting to be too much work.","I suppose it\u2019s comfort, perhaps a sense of self-control, doing worse things to yourself than the world will ever dare inflict.","We are not special. We are not crap or trash, either. We just are. We just are, and what happens just happens.","Reality means you live until you die. The real truth is nobody wants reality.","All human beings search for either reasons to be good, or excuses to be bad.","New carpet will exude poisonous formaldehyde for up to two years after it\'d been laid. I know the feeling.","Life is short, death is forever","Someday you will die, and until you know that, you\'re useless to me.","It is a hundred-year-old witch book, bound in human skin and probably written in ancient cum...YOU lick it!","Until you find something to fight for, you settle for something to fight against.","If I could wake up in a different place, at a different time, could I wake up as a different person?","Here in your mind you have complete privacy.

This is insomnia.","The future you have, tomorrow, won\'t be the same future you had, yesterday.","Just keep asking yourself: What would Jesus not do?","Anybody\'s true nature is bullshit. There is no human soul. Emotion is bullshit. Love is bullshit.","Who you are moment to moment is just a story.","some soap opera, you know, real people pretending to be fake people with made-up problems being watched by real people to forget their real problems.","Without pain, without sacrifice we would have nothing. Like the first monkey shot into space.","Masochism is a valuable job skill.","Hope is something really tough and tenacious you have to give up.

Our war is spiritual. Our depression is our lives.","Everyone smiles with that invisible gun to their head.","Put a gun to my head and paint the wall with my brains.","The unreal is more powerful than the real. Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. Because it\'s only intangibles, ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. Wood rots. People, well, they die.","Honest is how I want to look. The truth doesn\'t glitter and shine.","The gyms you go to are crowded with guys trying to look like men, as if being a man means looking the way a sculptor or an art director says.","You have to jump into disaster with both feet.","If you flee from the things you fear, there\'s no resolution.","Help me give up my addiction to Hope.","You realize that our mistrust of the future makes it hard to give up the past.","I wanted to write about the moment when your addictions no longer hide the truth from you.

The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.","After you find out all the things that can go wrong, your life becomes less about living and more about waiting.","Most times, it\'s just a lot easier not to let the world know what\'s wrong.","You think maybe if you just work harder and faster, you can hold off the chaos, but then one day you\u2019re changing a patio light bulb with a five-year life span and you realize how you\u2019ll only be changing this light maybe ten more times before you\u2019ll be dead.","We don\'t have a great war in our generation, or a great depression, but we do, we have a great war of the spirit. We have a great revolution against the culture. The great depression is our lives. We have a spiritual depression.","Rant Casey used to say, \\"No matter what happens, it\'s always now...\\" Talk about cryptic.

It\'s a lot more difficult to perform one.","When we don\'t know who to hate, we hate ourselves.","If we can forgive what\u2019s been done to us... If we can forgive what we\u2019ve done to others... If we can leave all of our stories behind. Our being villains or victims. Only then can we maybe rescue the world.","Drugs or overeating or alcohol or sex, it was all just another way to find peace. To escape what we know. Our education. Our bite of the apple.","That\'s why I write, because life never works except in retrospect. You can\'t control life, at least you can control your version.","The truth is, every son raised by a single mom is pretty much born married.

When they\u2019re little, they believe everything you tell them about the world. As a mother, you\u2019re the world almanac and the encyclopedia and the dictionary and the Bible, all rolled up together. But after they hit some magic age, it\u2019s just the opposite. After that, you\u2019re either a liar or a fool or a villain.","I think, in a way, I invented the term \'fight club\' and that these things have always existed, but they never really had a label.

Mrs. Clark says it\u2019s to find a job you hate even more.","Want to talk third-wave feminism, you could cite Ariel Levy and the idea that women have internalized male oppression. Going to spring break at Fort Lauderdale, getting drunk, and flashing your breasts isn\'t an act of personal empowerment. It\'s you, so fashioned and programmed by the construct of patriarchal society that you no longer know what\'s best for yourself. A damsel too dumb to even know she\'s in distress.","And if you believe that we really have free will, then you know that God can\'t really control us. And since God can\'t control us, all God does is watch and change channels when He gets bored.","Maybe it\'s our sins that give God consolation when he finally has to give us cancer.","Jump way back to one time, Evie and me did this fashion shoot in a junk yard, in a slaughterhouse, in a mortuary. We\'d go anywhere to look good by comparison, and what I realize is mostly what I hate about Evie is the fact that she\'s so vain and stupid and needy.

You wonder, if there had been a low turnout at the crucifixion, would they have rescheduled?","What you have to understand, is your father was your model for God. If you\'re male and you\'re Christian and living in America, your father is your model for God. And if you never know your father, if your father bails out or dies or is never at home, what do you believe about God? What you end up doing is you spend your life searching for a father and God.

Using charm and beauty and good cheer to make life look easy.","It seems that so much writing is being done in the nineteenth-century model, where every connection has to be thoroughly explained.","It\'s only after we\'ve lost everything that we\'re free to do anything.","We\'ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we\'d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars.

Men or women, anybody bent over had no way of knowing who was doing the ram job, and this was the real reason you never wanted to end up here unless you had a family member or a friend who\'d stand with you the whole time. To protect you. To watch your ass, for real.","If anything I try to write something that would be more difficult to film. I tend to see film as competition and would like instead to do what books do best.","...no way could I fall in love. I just couldn\'t go there yet. Settle for less.

That year eventually unfolded as something less than the dream we\'d imagined.","When I first started writing, there was no way I\'d write a sex scene. That just seemed impossible. That\'s why in \\"Fight Club\\" all the sex happens off-screen. It\'s all just a noise on the other side of the wall or the ceiling. I just couldn\'t bring to write in a scene like that. So one of the challenges with \\"Choke\\" was I wanted to write sex scenes until I was really comfortable just writing them in a very mechanical way.","Taste is such a changing thing. Every age our tastes change. But the things that really last aren\'t necessarily the best or the worst or the most loved things, but they\'re the things that make the biggest impression.","I\'m giving you my life to prove to myself I can, I really can love somebody. Even when I\'m not getting paid, I can give love and happiness and charm. You see, I can handle the baby food and the not talking and being homeless and invisible, but I have to know that I can love somebody. Completely and totally, permanently and without hope of reward, just as an act of will, I will love somebody.","Just for the record, the weather today is increasing turmoil with a possible physical and emotional breakdown.","The photographer in my head says: Give me peace. Flash. Give me release. Flash.","Some stories, she\u2019d say, the more you tell them, the faster you use them up. Those kind, the drama burns off, and every version, they sound more silly and flat. The other kind of story, it uses you up. The more you tell it, the stronger it gets. Those kind of stories only remind you how stupid you were. Are. Will always be.","I\'m never going to have to work. None of my descendants are ever going to have to work; this is going to make me so much money. It was such a letdown when I realized that wasn\'t my invention.","\\"Getting fired,\\" Tyler says, \\"is the best thing that could happen to any of us. That way, we\u2019d quit treading water and do something with our lives.\\"","Some of the best ideas I get seem to happen when I\'m doing mindless manual labor or exercise.

Two\u2019s company. Drinking is fun. If there\u2019s a bottle, even if your glass isn\u2019t empty, a drunk, he\u2019ll pour a little in your glass before he fills his own. This only looks like generosity.","So often with beginning writers, the story that they want to start with is the most important story of their life - my molestation, my this, my horrible drug addiction - they want to tell that most important story, and they don\'t have the skills to tell it yet, so it ends up becoming a comedy. A powerful story told poorly becomes funny, it just makes people laugh behind their hands.","On a night without moon or stars you can\'t see a thing, but you can imagine anything.","To merely observe your culture without contributing to it seems very close to existing as a ghost.","Every stage of life has its own form of power, and we\'re always sort of terrified as to whether we can make the jump to the next form of power.","You humiliate a rich person and they\'re still rich. You humiliate a brilliant person and they\'re still smart. A person who is well connected is still the king of England. But if you humiliate a young person, you take away the only form of power they have.","Just let yourself be broken and humiliated. Just your whole life, keep telling people, I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry.","The weather today is an increasing trend towards denial.","My writing has to excite people and depict or include their experiences. That\'s part of my process - to go out and interact with people. It\'s very much like an archival process. I understand that the Brothers Grimm would go out and get people talking so they could document folk tales that weren\'t being documented any other way. I try to offer a little bit of myself - some experience from my life that evokes stories in other people.","More and more, the hardest part of crying is when I can\'t stop.","Nothing happened, and nothing kept happening.","Sticks and stones may break your bones but words can hurt like hell.","A writer\'s job is to cultivate what can go wrong.

As for the rest - God bless it all.","My whole life is about forgetting. It\'s my most valuable job skill.","you ever been trapped in a world where you\'re everyone\'s worst nightmare?","My stories tend to bring people from isolation into community - with at least one other person, usually with a whole community of people - so that they find themselves accepted back by a world that they kind of fled from.","The last story you should write is the most important story. You should start with a story that is just an amusing, entertaining, fun story to write and learn your writing chops with the least important things before you start applying them to the most important things.","I hate how on TV they have to fill so many minutes. It means they have to put in anything, and by doing so they sort of trivialize news; news becomes this commodity that they need to fill dead time between commercials with.","The liberator who destroys my property is fighting to save my spirit. The teacher who clears all possessions from my path will set me free.","What we think of as Halloween is really the product of media barons, city mayors, and candy-makers. You know, before the 1920s, Halloween was really a terrible, terrible night.","There was no real sense of life because she had nothing to contrast it with.","That if you could acquire enough, accomplish enough, you\u2019d never want to own or do another thing. That if you could eat or sleep enough, you\u2019d never need more. That if enough people loved you, you\u2019d stop needing love.","Disaster is a natural part of my evolution toward tragedy and dissolution.","That guy behind me on the airplane? He\'s been kicking my seat because he hates me. He\'s kicking my seat because he hates me and I\'m gonna kill him. When we get off this plane, I\'m gonna make eye contact. I\'m gonna kill that guy. And all of that is just stuff in my head, but it\'s good to get rid of that stuff.","A minute of perfection was worth the effort. A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection.","We\'re so structured and micromanaged, this isn\'t a world anymore, it\'s a damn cruise ship.","No matter how much you think you love somebody, you\'ll step back when the pool of their blood edges up too close.","I am an invisible monster, and I am incapable of loving anybody. You don\'t know which is worse.","It\'s funny how you never think about the women you\'ve had. It\'s always the ones who get away that you can\'t forget.","No matter how careful you are, there\'s going to be the sense you missed something, the collapsed feeling under your skin that you didn\'t experience it all. There\'s that fallen heart feeling that you rushed right through the moments where you should\'ve been paying attention. Well, get used to that feeling. That\'s how your whole life will feel some day.","The future is just wasted on some people.","At this rate, we\'ll never get to the future.","Doesn\'t reincarnation strike you as just another form of procrastination?","Torture is torture and humiliation is humiliation only when you choose to suffer.","Give me rampant intellectualism as a coping mechanism.","Six hundred and forty fish later, the only thing I know is everything you love will die.

The dinosaurs weren\'t morally good or bad, but they\'re all dead.","Folks build a reputation by attacking you while you\u2019re alive - or praising you after you ain\u2019t.","Maybe this is why so many serial killers work in pairs.

You and me against the world.","No matter what happens, it\u2019s always now.","I tagged a first-timer one night at fight club. That Saturday night, a young guy with an angel\u2019s face came to his first fight club, and I tagged him for a fight. That\u2019s the rule. If it\u2019s your first night in fight club, you have to fight. I knew that so I tagged him because the insomnia was on again, and I was in a mood to destroy something beautiful.","People die\', she says. \'People tear down houses. But furniture, fine, beautiful furniture, it just goes on and on, surviving everything.\' She says, \'Armoires are the cockroaches of our culture.","People had been working for so many years to make the world a safe, organized place. Nobody realized how boring it would become. With the whole world property-lined and speed-limited and zoned and taxed and regulated, with everyone tested and registered and adressed and recorded. Nobody had left much room for adventure, except maybe the kind you could buy. [...] The laws that keep us safe, these same laws condemn us to boredom.","Years of living in the hope that what you\'ll get will be better than what you have. Years of looking and feeling worse in the hope that you might look better.","A child who is disillusioned abruptly, by his peers or siblings, being ridiculed for his faith and imagination, may choose never to believe in anything- tangible or intangible- again. To never trust or wonder.","Somehow it seems wrong to photograph a blind person. It\u2019s like stealing something valuable they don\u2019t even know they own.","This is why I loved the support groups so much, if people thought you were dying, they gave you their full attention. If this might be the last time they saw you, they really saw you. Everything else about their checkbook balance and radio songs and messy hair went out the window. You had their full attention. People listened instead of just waiting for their turn to speak. And when they spoke, they weren\'t just telling you a story. When the two of you talked, you were building something, and afterward you were both different than before.","If it is the case that love does survive death, then you may consider this to be a happy ending. Boy meets girl. Boy gets girl. Happily ever after or not.","What you have to consider is the possibility that God doesn\'t like you. Could be, God hates us. This is not the worst thing that could happen.","It\'s obsequious little nicety-nice girls like me who allow assholes to run the world: Miss Harlot O\'Harlots, billionaire phony tree huggers, hypocrite drug-snorting, weed-puffing peace activists who fund the mass-murdering drug cartels and perpetuate crushing poverty in dirt-poor banana republics.

The murderer, the victim, the witness each of us thinks our role is the lead. Probably that goes for anybody in the world.","How this feels is I\'m just another task in God\'s daily planner: The Renaissance pencilled in for right after the Dark Ages. The Information Age is scheduled immediately after the Industrial Revolution. Then the Post-Modern Era, then The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Famine. Check. Pestilence. Check. War. Check. Death. Check. And between the big events, the earthquakes and tidal waves, God\'s got me squeezed in for a cameo appearance.

If you\u2019re watching daytime television, this is your new demographic. You\u2019re a drunk. Or a cripple. Or an idiot.","They assume she was once gorgeously beautiful. Because now she looks so\u2014bad.","Telling some stories, Miss Leroy says, is committing suicide.","That\u2019s how a scary story works. It echoes some ancient fear.

It\u2019s something you\u2019d hoped was healed.","No, Miss Wright didn\'t want to meet her kid. To her, that relationship was just as important, just as ideal and impossible as it would be to the child. She\'d expect that young man to be perfect, smart, and talented, everything to compensate for all the mistakes that she\'d made. The whole wasted, unhappy mess of her life.","I used rebellion as a way to hide out. We use criticism as a fake participation.","This is less teaching than damage control. You may as well paint a house that\u2019s on fire.","If you look at old pictures, Irene Casey is so pretty.

They were completely omniscient and you took their word for everything. And then you got older and you went through this hideous age when suddenly they were the devil, they were bullies, and they didn\'t know anything.","If you take my stuff apart, you\'ll find my choruses of repetitions are picked up almost verbatim from Kurt Vonnegut, and my distanced fracture quality is all from Amy Hempel, who\'s probably my favourite writer.","Minimalism seems closest to the sophisticated storytelling of movies. Movies have really educated contemporary audiences to be the most intelligent, sophisticated audiences in history. We don\'t any longer need to have the relationship between one scene and the next explained. We will figure it out ourselves.","My goal is more to be remembered. They\'ll remember this thing and like it in the future. The trick is to stay remembered long enough for that to happen.","You can tell a more over-the-top incredible story if you use a nonfiction form.","Any \'artist\' makes a living by expressing what others can\'t - because they\'re unaware of their feelings, they\'re too afraid to express those feelings, or they lack the skills to communicate and be understood.","Only through destroying myself can I discover the greater power of my spirit.","More and more, it feels like I\'m doing a really bad impersonation of myself.","You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake... This is your life, and it\'s ending one minute at a time.","Why is it you feel like a dope if you laugh alone, but that\'s usually how you end up crying?","I\'m always trying to reach a transcendent point, a romantic point, but reach it in a really unconventional way, a really profane way. To get to that romantic, touching, heartbreaking place, but through a lot of acts of profanity.","I like to get people moving and jumping. I think it\'s good to add more emotion and chaos.","I really love idiot, enlightened characters - these characters who fail to engage with the drama of their immediate circumstances; they fail to be reactive and enrolled by drama as it happens around them.","The only difference between suicide and martyrdom is press coverage.","I think in a way, you\'re doomed, once you can envision something. You\'re sort of doomed to make it happen. I\'ve found that the moment I can envision leaving a relationship, that\'s usually the moment that the relationship starts to fall apart.","Every time I write something, I think, this is the most offensive thing I will ever write. But no. I always surprise myself.","Maybe humans are just the pet alligators that God flushed down the toilet.","The only thing I shy away from is non-consensual violence.

I decided I wouldn\'t write on people anymore, but I\'d give them arms and legs and if they wanted those autographed I\'d do that.","You hear the best stories from ordinary people. That sense of immediacy is more real to me than a lot of writerly, literary-type crafted stories. I want that immediacy when I read a novel.","I want out of the labels.

Unknown. Undefined.","Sorry, mom. Sorry, God.","He was assaulting the world by assaulting himself.","I tiger can smile A snake will say it loves you Lies make us evil","This is the biggest mistake I could think would save me. I wanted to give up the idea that I had any control. Shake things up. To be saved by chaos. To see if I could cope, I wanted to force myself to grow again. To explode my comfort zone.","Find good in what the world says is evil.","What\'s burning down is a re-creation of a period revival house patterned after a copy of a copy of a copy of a mock Tudor big manor house.

You can be a student in anything and not have to know anything. Just say toxicology or marine biokinesis, and the person you\'re talking to will change the subject to himself. If this doesn\'t work, mention the neural synapses of embryonic pigeons.","Hysteria is impossible without an audience. Panicking by yourself is the same as laughing alone in an empty room. You feel really silly.","I hate how I don\'t feel real enough unless people are watching.","You only ask people about themselves so you can tell them about yourself.","I could imagine myself becoming one of Marla\'s stories.","If you\'re going to read this, don\'t bother.","At first, the new owner pretends he never looked at the living room floor.","As young people we want something to slow us down and keep us trapped in one place long enough to look below the surface of the world. That disaster is a car crash or a war. To make us sit still. It can be getting cancer or getting pregnant. The important part is how it seems to catch us by surprise. That disaster stops us from living the life we\'d planned as children - a life of constant dashing around.","All you can do is hope for a pattern to emerge, and sometimes it never does. Still, with a plan, you only get the best you can imagine. I\'d always hoped for something better than that.","Skinny guys fight till they\'re burger.","If you start in the pit of despair with these profane, awful things, even a glimmer of hope or awareness is going to occur that\'s much brighter coming from this dark, awful beginning.","In the world I see you are stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rock feller Center. You\'ll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life. You\'ll climb the wrist-thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Towers. And when you look down, you\'ll see tiny figures pounding corn, laying stripes of venison on the empty car pool lane of some abandoned superhighways.","We\'re consumers. We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don\'t concern me.

I say evolve, and let the chips fall where they may!","You have to give up! you have to give up! You have to realize that someday you will die, Until you know that, you are useless!","For thousands of years, human beings had screwed up and trashed and crapped on this planet, and now history expected me to clean up after everyone. I have to wash out and flatten my soup cans. And account for every drop of used motor oil.

Others use you up.","I know this because Tyler knows this.","We just had a near-life experience!","You turn up your music to hide the noise. Other people turn up their music to hide yours.

By now this should be easy.","A guy\'s calling to say he\'s failing algebra II. Just as a point of practice, I say, Kill yourself. A woman calls and says her kids won\'t behave.

Please, don\u2019t kill it with big words.","Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, I\'ll be anybody you want me to be. Use me. Change me. I can be thin with big breasts and big hair. Take me apart. Make me into anything, but just love me.","That\'s what I love about fire, how it would kill me as quick as anybody else. How it can\'t know I\'m its mother.

Jump to the day another house will stand here and the people living there won\'t know we ever happened.","Be famous. Be a big social experiment in getting what you don\'t want. Find value in what we\'ve been taught is worthless. Find good in what the world says is evil. I\'m giving you my life because I want the whole world to know you.

The day men can give birth, that\'s when we can start talking about equal rights.","Really, just looking around, you feel a twinge of pity for the poor souls who succeeded in getting past the Pearly Gates. One can\'t help but picture the lackluster VIP lounge in Heaven, a kind of nonalcoholic ice-cream social starring Harriet Beecher Stowe and Mahatma Gandhi.

That most genuine form of joy.","I\'m not so much a good friend as I\'m the savior who wants you to worship him forever.","No matter how much you love someone, you still want to have you own way.","Those who can forget the past are way ahead of the rest of us.","I spent my life attacking everything because I was too afraid to risk creating anything.","There are bodies buried everywhere you just have to know where to look.","You know that old phrase \u2018Those who don\u2019t remember the past are condemned to repeat it\u2019?

Teachers and education can only remind us of what we already know.","Seek midday nourishment.

Not a child of God.","Maybe the truth is I really want to like you instead.","Our culture has made us all the same. No one is truly white or black or rich, anymore. We all want the same. Individually, we are nothing.","Nobody wants to worship you if you have the same problems, the same bad breath and messy hair and hangnails, as a regular person. You have to be everything regular people aren\u2019t. Where they fail, you have to go all the way. Be what people are too afraid to be. Become whom they admire.

The tragedy of her life is that she doesn\'t.","Because I can\'t hit bottom, I can\'t be saved.","Ever since college, I make friends. They get married.

Preserve every second.","It\'s nice to see something more pathetic than I feel right now.","Love is bullshit. Emotion is bullshit.","The same as real life, there is no happily ever after.","There\'s still a thousand places I haven\'t gone to die.","You gain power by pretending to be weak. By contrast, you make people feel strong. You save people by letting them save you.","Just let your hand drop; and let fate decide for you.","The first time we meet another person an insidious little voice in our heads says, \\"I might wear eyeglasses or be chunky around the hips or a girl, but at least I\'m not Gay or Black or a Jew.\\" Meaning: I may be me- but at least I have the good sense not to be YOU.","Deliver me from Swedish furniture.

It\'s a kind of slummy, condescending gesture, like when rich people ask poor people where they summer. To me, this smacks of a blatant, insensitive \\"let them eat cake\\" type of chauvinism.","In all probability the Human Genome Project will, someday, find that I carry some recessive gene for optimism, because despite all my best efforts I still can\'t scrape together even a couple days of hopelessness. Future scientists will call it the Pollyanna Syndrome, and if forced to guess, I\'d say that mine has been a way-long case history of chasing rainbows.","I might be a touch of a sadist and a little bit jejune... but at least I\'m not a victim, not any longer. I hope. I hope, therefore I am.","I was tired and crazy and rushed, and every time I boarded a plane, I wanted the plane to crash. I envied people dying of cancer. I hated my life.

Every generation hates the next trend in music they can\'t understand. We hate to give up those reins of our culture. To find our own music playing in elevators. The ballad for our revolution, turned into background music for a television commercial. To find our generation\'s clothes and hair suddenly retro.","Language, she said, was just our way to explain away the wonder and glory of the world. To deconstruct. To dismiss.

Even what\u2019s inside you already, the colonies of microbes and bugs that eat your food for you, without them you\u2019d die. Nothing of you is all-the-way yours. All of you is inherited.

People didn\'t seem at all bothered by that.","You could go church and you could describe your worst behavior, your worst self, and despite your worst behavior you would be forgiven and then redeemed and then accepted back into the community through communion. So you didn\'t have to carry this burden your entire life. Once a week you went someplace you went someplace where you could really look terrible and be loved despite how terrible you were.","My theory is that church used to be that place. Instead of being a place where you went to look good, it was a place where you could risk going every week to look your worst.","Don\'t write about your most emotionally charged moment as a learning thing.","My books are always about someone obtaining a power to replace the previous sort of power that they held.","More and more we are taught something throughout our growing up, our education, and continuously, no matter how much we believe in this thing, something comes up that forces us to revise our entire belief system. No matter whom you idolize, it turns out that Louis Armstrong collected vast amounts of pornography.","All major publishing houses have these big fat biographies sitting there, waiting for people to die. All you have to do is slap on the end and put in on the market. It\'s that kind of commoditization and completion of your life before you die - and this kind of imposition of a public idea of self that replaces the actual living self - that I find so frightening.","I know so many writers who are a hundred times better than me and have longer, greater ideas than mine, but they gave up; they stopped. The biggest talent you can have is determination.","I have to have everything in my life completely fixed and perfect and cleaned up and I have to be complete with everyone in my life and I have seven days in which to do that. So I might make it to day three or four, but I\'ve never made it all the way to day seven.","You don\'t have ideas when you\'re sitting in that sort of sterile little place, and you\'re not around people. The most boring scenes are the scenes where a character is alone. I just need that dynamic of other people around me to get my work done.","After you hear even the shortest great story, it should fill you with a little bit of fear.","That\'s how a good story works. It changes how you feel. It brings you to a greater appreciation, a greater joy, of your own existence.","The one thing I cannot stand is when I do interviews, when I interview people, and I listen to the tapes and I hear myself talking and sort of stumble and stammer, or I hear the horrible sound of my own voice, or God forbid I see myself on video, there is that complete revulsion with seeing how I occur in the world.","People who don\'t want to get on with their lives, and don\'t want to accept responsibility for the direction of their lives want to hang out with other people who don\'t want to accept responsibility or move on, and so you find that your entire culture around you are people who are just like you, because that\'s what\'s comforting.","Public taste changes and the aesthetic of a culture changes over time, so the idea isn\'t to appeal to the aesthetic of the moment and what people will like right now; the idea is to somehow keep yourself in the public memory so that as taste evolves it will eventually come to embrace your thing. So, it\'s about writing to be remembered rather than writing to be liked.","More and more people are defining themselves not by what they are about, but by what they are against, what they are overcoming, the thing that is wrong with them.","I went to sexaholics anonymous for six months. For research. I wanted to see the structure of the groups, how they were conducted, and what the atmosphere was like, and also to be able to describe the people as human beings, rather than as the dirty jokes that they are in our culture.","What you write should entertain you and serve you first. Don\'t worry about maintaining anything beyond your own attention. Focus on exorcising your demons in the work. If you can do that, then you\'ll succeed in the world.","And it [Fight Club novel] was written so general that my father thought I was writing about his father, and my boss thought I was writing about his boss. People really put themselves, you know, in the shoes of the narrator.","As a child of the 1970s, I couldn\'t hold a narrative in my head; I was lucky if I could hold a joke in my head, because every time you turn on television or radio, it wipes the slate clean - at least in my case. After I gave up television, I found I could carry longer and longer stories or ideas in my head and put them together until I was carrying an entire short story. That\'s pretty much when I started writing.","For the most part my friends can always be more entertaining than the tube ever can be.","Language is what books do very well and movement is what movies does very well.","I\'m really glad that I made a lot of mistakes, poorly chose my friends throughout my twenties, and didn\'t have a rocket trajectory that set me on one path without making any mistakes or having any setbacks. The older I get, the more I realize that it\'s all of these failed, horrible things from my past, and the stories that they generated, that are the things I will draw on for the rest of my life.","Screenwriters get paid a hell of a lot more money but their level of frustration seems to be so high that I don\'t want that.","I\'m always looking for context in which people tell stories. In \\"Fight Club\\" it\'s these support groups for dying people, and then in \\"Choke\\" it\'s 12-step recovery groups. In one novel it\'s artists\' colonies, in another novel it\'s a diary form that submariners\' wives typically keep so that when their husband comes back from serving on a submarine they have an accounting of their spouse\'s time. So I\'m always looking for, number one, a non-fiction context - because you can tell a more outrageous story if you use a non-fiction form.","People take conventional ways that other people have always decorated their cars, and use them as ways of giving other people permission to approach them.","A certain number of people have to live their lives outdoors between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., and a certain number of people can only leave their homes between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. So basically, public life has to be lived in these shifts, in order for everyone to fit on the streets because there\'s just no more room for any more infrastructure, any more highways. So it polarizes the community into day people and night people, and it becomes sort of a metaphor for racism and classism.","I\'m not really into comfort books. There are too many of those as it is. Just sort of narcotic books, like my grandmother used to read. They have value like Paxil has value, but there\'s plenty of them in the world already. There\'s a shortage of confronting, stimulating, exciting books.","Schools of science and physics replacing each other at a faster and faster rate. Just the nature of our world is constant revision, constant...negation of previous beliefs, and so...the whole world is a twist ending. Every week is a twist ending.","When I see people talking on the internet about me or my work it\'s almost always more a description of themselves and so I never really think of myself as anything more than just who I always was.","I thought why not write a kind of mystery, murder, thriller book, but use romance language where the language plays completely against the very dark subject matter, that very strange murderous plot, but use that Harlequin Romance language.","The ultimate joke was the idea that capitalism would eat its own feces in order to make money, that would make fun of itself if capitalism thought there was a buck in it.","I have an experience with as many of my readers as possible that\'s really genuine. I love it when they write to me, and I\'m able to send them things. I love meeting them in person, and even if it\'s only for a moment I love having that physical, touching interaction.","The short stories tend to be a journalistic gathering of anecdotes that are put together to make something larger.","I think standardization is really the first step to something being commodified.","Cults make people sing so hard for so long - because it over-oxygenates the blood and sets them up to faint.","The rules that I adhere to are the rules of minimalism. And those rules kind of force writing to be more filmic... to have the immediacy and accessibility of film so that the reader really has to fill in a lot of the details.","A comedy ends with a wedding, and a tragedy ends with a funeral: you always have to juxtapose sex and death.","Everyone wants to be tested and challenged. Everyone would like a good, honest fight to exhaust their frustrations.","To a certain extent everybody has a certain sort of way of being a persona that they learn how to be when they\'re really little. They figure out that if they\'re really funny, or really pretty, or if they work really, really hard or are really smart, then that\'s what\'s going to get them by. That is what is going to make people like them.","I think we\'re in an age starved for genuine experiences, instead of cathartic phony experiences through the media, structured, engineered experiences. And those are the fast food, the masturbation of experience. They don\'t really exhaust any aspect of ourselves; they don\'t make us any stronger.","Everyone is equal and everyone is forced to participate; you can\'t just be a spectator.","My books do have a sort of romantic community at the end - people coming together. But on a more basic level, I always see them as being about power, in the same way that Harry Potter books are pitched to a population of young people who really have no power.","I\'m fascinated by the whole issue of arousal addiction, which seems to be mostly a problem for young men.","I\'m working harder than I have ever worked in my entire life, but what the hell, my life is my job now, and my job is my life and that\'s the way it should be.","I see so many tattoos of my stuff on people - tattoos of my book covers, tattoos of quotes . . . it\'s kind of daunting sometimes.","I spend most of my life just listening to people.","The money is in television. Books are not the dominant medium of our time, so fewer people will create them. In a sad way, books have become a form of \\"comfort food\\" we expect to lull us to sleep.","I realized that my book readings were boring me. I was going to go up there and read a passage and sleepwalk through the whole event and I needed to make it more interesting. I wanted to be running and jumping and do something so that the event would be so exciting. I had to trick myself into having fun every time.","I learned all those jokes in second grade. Second grade is really where they tell you those horrific jokes, racist jokes and misogynistic jokes that you have no idea what they mean, and you just memorize them because they have a very strong effect, they make people laugh in this kind of nervous, horrible way, and it\'s only later that you realize that you\'ve got a head full of crap.","My writing process isn\'t a very organized thing. The actual writing part is a tiny part of my life. I often write in public. I bring my laptop or write freehand in notebooks. Then, I\'ll read through them while I exercise or walk the dog. The very last thing I do is the sitting alone at the computer part.","When someone walks in and you say \\"a six-foot-tall man,\\" you miss the opportunity to describe what a six-foot-tall man would look like to your narrator, because how the narrator describes a six-foot-tall man says more about the narrator than about the man.","There is a social contract in \\"Fight Club\\" and in \\"Choke\\" where the protagonist has deceived a whole bunch of people. In \\"Choke\\" it\'s all of these people who think that they\'ve saved his life, and really care about him because they\'ve embraced him and they\'ve been his saviors. In \\"Fight Club\\" it\'s all of these people who are dying of various diseases, and they thought that Edward Norton was also dying so they allowed him really strong pent-up emotions.","Since we do operate in a binary world, if there\'s something that cannot be this or that, it drives us crazy.","Everybody\'s still miserable in the same way they\'ve always been miserable, and more and more of my friends - especially my male friends - find themselves taking anti-anxiety, psychotropic drugs. It seems like everybody I know is wondering if they\'re really who they are, or once the prescription runs out, will they become someone different?","I can manage my own pain. I can drink. I can go to the doctor and get a prescription. I can exercise. I can write a story about it. I\'ve done it a million times! But I don\'t want to see the people I love tortured and suffering.","Abortion occurs so frequently in my stories. Abortion sort of synthesizes both sex and death. To have sex and death placed as close to one another as possible is always a goal of mine.","I remember selling my first short story and thinking, Oh my god, I sold something for fifty dollars! That gives me the authority to say I\'m a writer and to actually write more things! It legitimized the activity.","Ultimately, everyone is acting out of what they feel is the best choice. In a way, they\'re all trying to improve the world. And I think that those basic choices make the world a better place.","I am a writer and the greatest compliment I can get is to know that I\'ve contributed language to the culture, that I\'ve defined something, given it a name. So I think that is one of the great things a writer can do.","My books are more about people experimenting with different identities and social models in a short-term way before they can break through to something authentic.","I write because it\'s a way of presenting something without having to be there.","The only place where you can really surprise or shock the reader, or make someone laugh, is on the lower righthand corner - the very last panel - so as you turn the page, the payoff is in the upper lefthand panel. To pace every story so that there\'s a setup and a payoff at the page turn was a huge challenge; it\'s a part of the medium and you really have to learn what can be done in the medium.","It\'s interesting because when David Fincher was making \\"Fight Club,\\" he said, \\"It\'s a romance.\\" And it really is. Almost everything I ever write is just a romance. And that needed to be sort of pointed up at the end of \\"Fight Club.\\" The film has a very different ending than the book does.","Every character sees the world through a framework of education and experience that they\'re proud experts about. To write a character, find out what they know best, and THEN you\'ll know how they\'ll describe a \\"hot day.\\" Or a \\"pretty girl.\\"","I\'m really glad that I spent my twenties messing around and having disaster after disaster - with people who were doing likewise - because it\'s really my greatest treasure now.","You are not your job, you\'re not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You\'re not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.","No matter how careful you are, there\'s going to be the sense you missed something, the collapsed feeling under your skin that you didn\'t experience it all. There\'s that fallen heart feeling that you rushed right through the moments where you should\'ve been paying attention.Well, get used to that feeling. That\'s how your whole life will feel some day.This is all practice.","You are not special. You\'re not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You\'re the same decaying organic matter as everything else. We\'re all part of the same compost heap. We\'re all singing, all dancing crap of the world.","If death meant just leaving the stage long enough to change costume and come back as a new character...Would you slow down? Or speed up?","A girl calls and asks, \\"Does it hurt very much to die?\\"\\"Well, sweetheart,\\" I tell her, \\"yes, but it hurts a lot more to keep living.","Ok. You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me. You show me a sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole. Is this a pretty accurate description of our relationship.","At the time, my life just seemed too complete, and maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves.","When did the future switch from being a promise to being a threat?","Warning: If you are reading this then this warning is for you. Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don\'t you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can\'t think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all that claim it? Do you read everything you\'re supposed to read? Do you think every thing you\'re supposed to think? Buy what you\'re told to want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex. Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you\'re alive. If you don\'t claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned.","If you don\'t know what you want,\\" the doorman said, \\"you end up with a lot you don\'t.","The only difference between a suicide and a martyrdom really is the amount of press coverage.","I see in the fight club the strongest and smartest men who\'ve ever lived. I see all this potential and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables, slaves with white collars, advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don\'t need. We\'re the middle children of the history man, no purpose or place, we have no Great war, no Great depression, our great war is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives, we\'ve been all raised by television to believe that one day we\'d all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars, but we won\'t and we\'re slowly learning that fact. and we\'re very very pissed off.","Just for the record, the weather today is partly suspicious with chances of betrayal.","There are only patterns, patterns on top of patterns, patterns that affect other patterns. Patterns hidden by patterns. Patterns within patterns. If you watch close, history does nothing but repeat itself. What we call chaos is just patterns we haven\'t recognized. What we call random is just patterns we can\'t decipher. what we can\'t understand we call nonsense. What we can\'t read we call gibberish.There is no free will. There are no variables.","I\u2019ve met God across his long walnut desk with his diplomas hanging on the wall behind him, and God asks me, \u201cWhy?Why did I cause so much pain?Didn\u2019t I realize that each of us is a sacred, unique snowflake of special unique specialness?Can\u2019t I see how we\u2019re all manifestations of love?I look at God behind his desk, taking notes on a pad, but God\u2019s got this all wrong.We are not special.We are not crap or trash, either.We just are.We just are, and what happens just happens.And God says, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right.\u201dYeah. Well. Whatever. You can\u2019t teach God anything.\u201d","Reality means you live until you die...the real truth is nobody wants reality.","The things you own end up owning you. It\'s only after you lose everything that you\'re free to do anything.","People don\'t want their lives fixed. Nobody wants their problems solved. Their dramas. their distractions. Their stories resolved. Their messes cleaned up. Because what would they have left? Just the big scary unknown.","Fuck me. I\'m so tired of being me. Me beautiful. Me ugly. Blonde. Brunette. A million fucking fashion makeovers that only leave me trapped being me.Who I was before the accident is just a story now. Everything before now, before now, before now, is just a story I carry around. I guess that would apply to anybody in the world. What I need is a new story about who I am.What I need to do is fuck up so bad I can\'t save myself.","Just for the record, the weather today is bitter with occasional fits of jealous rage.","The idea that I can\'t share my problems with other people makes me not give a shit about their problems.","Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don\'t need.","I thought we were a real love relationship. I did. I was very invested in love, but it was just this long long sex thing that could end at any moment because after all, it\'s just about getting off. Almost all the time, you tell yourself you\'re loving somebody when you\'re just using them. This only looks like love.","Give me lust, baby.Flash.Give me malice.Flash.Give me detached existentialist ennui.Flash.Give me rampant intellectualism as a coping mechanism.Flash.","Nothing drives people crazier than seeing someone have a good fucking life.","Maybe you don\'t go to hell for the things you do. Maybe you go to hell for the things you don\'t do. The things you don\'t finish.","Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken!","Experts in ancient Greek culture say that people back then didn\'t see their thoughts as belonging to them. When ancient Greeks had a thought, it occurred to them as a god or goddess giving an order. Apollo was telling them to be brave. Athena was telling them to fall in love. Now people hear a commercial for sour cream potato chips and rush out to buy, but now they call this free will.At least the ancient Greeks were being honest.","Worker bees can leave.Even drones can fly away.The Queen is their slave.","We\u2019re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War\u2019s a spiritual war\u2026 our Great Depression is our lives.

And we\u2019re very, very pissed off.","Remember this. The people you\'re trying to step on, we\'re everyone you depend on.

Other forms of mass media cost too much to produce a risk reaching only a limited audience. Only one person. But a book. . . . A book is cheap to print and bind. A book is as private and consensual as sex. A book takes time and effort to consume - something that gives a reader every chance to walk away. Actually, so few people make the effort to read that it\'s difficult to call books a \\"mass medium.\\" No one really gives a damn about books.

Like swimming a river of shit for a kiss.","By first believing in Santa Claus, then the Easter Bunny, then the Tooth Fairy, Rant Casey was recognizing that those myths are more than pretty stories and traditions to delight children. Or to modify behavior. Each of those three traditions asks a child to believe in the impossible in exchange for a reward. These are stepped-up tests to build a child\'s faith and imagination. The first test is to believe in a magical person, with toys as the reward. The second test is to trust in a magical animal, with candy as the reward. The last test is the most difficult, with the most abstract reward: To believe, trust in a flying fairy that will leave money. From a man to an animal to a fairy. From toys to candy to money. Thus, interestingly enough, transferring the magic of faith and trust from sparkling fairy-dom to clumsy, tarnished coins. From gossamer wings to nickels... dimes... and quarters. In this way, a child is stepped up to greater feats of imagination and faith as he or she matures. Beginning with Santa in infancy, and ending with the Tooth Fairy as the child acquires adult teeth. Or, plainly put, beginning with all the possibility of childhood, and ending with an absolute trust in the national currency.","We just had a near-life experience","How you\'re still always trapped.How your head is the cave, your eyes the cave mouth.

Despite the fact most parents don\'t recognize this function, they still practice the exercise. Rant also saw how resolving the illusions is crucial to how the child uses any new skills. A child who is never coached with Santa Claus may never develop an ability to imagine. To him, nothing exists except the literal and tangible. A child who is disillusioned abruptly, by his peers or siblings, being ridiculed for his faith and imagination, may choose never to believe in anything- tangible or intangible- again. To never trust or wonder.But a child who relinquishes the illusions of Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy, that child may come away with the most important skill set. That child may recognize the strength of his own imagination and faith. He will embrace the ability to create his own reality. That child becomes his own authority. He determines the nature of his world. His own vision. And by doing so, by the power of his example, he determines the reality of the other two types: those who can\'t imagine, and those who can\'t trust.","It\u2019s pathetic how we can\u2019t live with the things we can\u2019t understand.

As each subsequent civilization became a dominant power, among its first acts was to depose and demonize whoever the previous culture had worshipped. The Jews attacked Belial, the god of the Babylonians. The Christians banished Pan and Loki anda Mars, the respective deities of the ancient Greeks and Celts and Romans. The Anglican British banned belief in the Australian aboriginal spirits known as the Mimi. Satan is depicted with cloven hooves because Pan had them, and he carries a pitchfork based on the trident carried by Neptune. As each deity was deposed, it was relegated to Hell. For gods so long accustomed to receiving tribute and loving attention, of course this status shift put them into a foul mood.","Getting fired,\u2019 Tyler says, \u2018is the best thing that could happen to any of us.

And if you never know your father, if your father bails out or dies or is never at home, what do you believe about God?What you end up doing is you spend your life searching for a father and God.

This first patch of cheatgrass was in southern British Columbia, Canada, in 1889. But fire spreads it. Every year, it dries to gunpowder, and now land that used to burn every ten years, it burns every year. And the cheatgrass recovers fast. Cheatgrass loves fire. But the native plants, the sagebrush and desert phlox, they don\u2019t. And every year it burns, there\u2019s more cheatgrass and less anything else. And the deer and antelope that depended on those other plants are gone now. So are the rabbits. So are the hawks and owls that ate the rabbits. The mice starve, so the snakes that ate the mice starve. Today, cheatgrass dominates the inland deserts from Canada to Nevada, covering an area over twice the size of the state of Nebraska and spreading by thousands of acres per year.

This was the very end of summer, and I was asleep. Tyler was naked and sweating, gritty with sand, his hair wet and stringy, hanging in his face.Tyler had been around before we met.Tyler was pulling driftwood logs out of the surf and dragging them up the beach. In the wet sand, he\u2019d already planted a half circle of logs so they stood a few inches apart and as tall as his eyes. There were four logs, and when I woke up, I watched Tyler pull a fifth log up the beach. Tyler dug a hole under one end of the log, then lifted the other end until the log slid into the hole and stood there at a slight angle.You wake up at the beach.We were the only people on the beach.With a stick, Tyler drew a straight line in the sand several feet away. Tyler went back to straighten the log by stamping sand around its base.I was the only person watching this.Tyler called over, \u201cDo you know what time it is?I always wear a watch,\u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201dI asked, where?\u201cRight here,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cRight now.\u201d It was 4:06 P.M.After a while, Tyler sat cross-legged in the shadow of the standing logs. Tyler sat for a few minutes, got up and took a swim, pulled on a T-shirt and a pair of sweatpants, and started to leave. I had to ask.I had to know what Tyler was doing while I was asleep.If I could wake up in a different place, at a different time, could I wake up as a different person?I asked if Tyler was an artist.Tyler shrugged and showed me how the five standing logs were wider at the base. Tyler showed me the line he\u2019d drawn in the sand, and how he\u2019d used the line to gauge the shadow cast by each log. Sometimes, you wake up and have to ask where you are. What Tyler had created was the shadow of a giant hand. Only now the fingers were Nosferatu-long and the thumb was too short, but he said how at exactly four-thirty the hand was perfect. The giant shadow hand was perfect for one minute, and for one perfect minute Tyler had sat in the palm of a perfection he\u2019d created himself.You wake up, and you\u2019re nowhere.One minute was enough Tyler said, a person had to work hard for it, but a minute of perfection was worth the effort.
