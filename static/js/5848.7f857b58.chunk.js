B. Spottsworth to make the obituary column. He thought the lion was dead, and the lion thought it wasn\'t.","One of the poets, whose name I cannot recall, has a passage, which I am unable at the moment to remember, in one of his works, which for the time being has slipped my mind, which hits off admirably this age-old situation.","An apple a day, if well aimed, keeps the doctor away.","He had just about enough intelligence to open his mouth when he wanted to eat, but certainly no more.","As we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of human happiness, we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people.","Alcohol is a misunderstood vitamin.","Everything in life that\u2019s any fun, as somebody wisely observed, is either immoral, illegal or fattening.","It was one of the dullest speeches I ever heard. The Agee woman told us for three quarters of an hour how she came to write her beastly book, when a simple apology was all that was required.","A melancholy-looking man, he had the appearance of one who has searched for the leak in life\'s gas-pipe with a lighted candle.","The voice of Love seemed to call to me, but it was a wrong number.","There is no surer foundation for a beautiful friendship than a mutual taste in literature.","He had the look of one who had drunk the cup of life and found a dead beetle at the bottom.","It is a good rule in life never to apologize.

I can follow the broad, general principles, of course. I mean to say, I know that the main scheme is to work the ball down the field somehow and deposit it over the line at the other end and that, in order to squalch this programme, each side is allowed to put in a certain amount of assault and battery and do things to its fellow man which, if done elsewhere, would result in 14 days without the option, coupled with some strong remarks from the Bench.","A certain critic -- for such men, I regret to say, do exist -- made the nasty remark about my last novel that it contained \'all the old Wodehouse characters under different names.\' He has probably by now been eaten by bears, like the children who made mock of the prophet Elisha: but if he still survives he will not be able to make a similar charge against Summer Lightning. With my superior intelligence, I have out-generalled the man this time by putting in all the old Wodehouse characters under the same names. Pretty silly it will make him feel, I rather fancy.","A man\'s subconscious self is not the ideal companion. It lurks for the greater part of his life in some dark den of its own, hidden away, and emerges only to taunt and deride and increase the misery of a miserable hour.","Unlike the male codfish which, suddenly finding itself the parent of three million five hundred thousand little codfish, cheerfully resolves to love them all, the British aristocracy is apt to look with a somewhat jaundiced eye on its younger sons.","Sober or blotto, this is your motto: keep muddling through.","As Shakespeare says, if you\'re going to do a thing you might as well pop right at it and get it over.","I\'m not absolutely certain of the facts, but I rather fancy it\'s Shakespeare who says that it\'s always just when a fellow is feeling particularly braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with the bit of lead piping.","There are moments, Jeeves, when one asks oneself, \'Do trousers matter?\'\\" \\"The mood will pass, sir.","If men\'s minds were like dominoes, surely his would be the double blank.","It is true of course, that I have a will of iron, but it can be switched off if the circumstances seem to demand it.","You\'re one of those guys who can make a party just by leaving it. It\'s a great gift.","The least thing upset him on the links. He missed short putts because of the uproar of the butterflies in the adjoining meadows.","Always get to the dialogue as soon as possible. I always feel the thing to go for is speed. Nothing puts the reader off more than a big slab of prose at the start.","It is no use telling me there are bad aunts and good aunts. At the core, they are all alike. Sooner or later, out pops the cloven hoof.","And she\'s got brains enough for two, which is the exact quantity the girl who marries you will need.","Intoxicated?

A sombre nod. The nod Napoleon might have given if somebody had met him in 1812 and said, \\"So, you\'re back from Moscow, eh?","Every author really wants to have letters printed in the papers. Unable to make the grade, he drops down a rung of the ladder and writes novels.","Chumps always make the best husbands. When you marry, Sally, grab a chump. Tap his head first, and if it rings solid, don\'t hesitate. All the unhappy marriages come from husbands having brains. What good are brains to a man? They only unsettle him.","The real objection to the great majority of cats is their insufferable air of superiority.","Do you ever get moods when life seems absolutely meaningless? It\'s like a badly-constructed story, with all sorts of characters moving in and out who have nothing to do with the plot. And when somebody comes along that you think really has something to do with the plot, he suddenly drops out. After a while you begin to wonder what the story is about, and you feel that it\'s about nothing\u2014just a jumble.","What\'s the use of a great city having temptations if fellows don\'t yield to them?","This was not Aunt Dahlia, my good and kindly aunt, but my Aunt Agatha, the one who chews broken bottles and kills rats with her teeth.","Luck is a goddess not to be coerced and forcibly wooed by those who seek her favours. From such masterful spirits she turns away.

Absolutely.","It is fatal to let any dog know that he is funny, for he immediately loses his head and starts hamming it up.","Cats, as a class, have never completely got over the snootiness caused by the fact that in ancient Egypt they were worshipped as gods. This makes them prone to set themselves up as critics and censors of the frail and erring human beings whose lot they share.","In all crises of human affairs there are two broad courses open to a man. He can stay where he is or he can go elsewhere.","One of the Georges - I forget which - once said that a certain number of hours\xb4 sleep each night - I cannot recall at the moment how many - made a man something which for the time being has slipped my memory.","It was loud in spots and less loud in other spots, and it had that quality which I have noticed in all violin solos of seeming to last much longer than it actually did.","She looked like something that might have occured to Ibsen in one of his less frivolous moments.","I believe the only way a writer can keep himself up to the mark is by examining each story quite coldly before he starts writing it and asking himself if it is all right as a story. I mean, once you go saying to yourself, \'This is a pretty weak plot as it stands, but I\'m such a hell of a writer that my magic touch will make it okay,\' you\'re sunk. If they aren\'t in interesting situations, characters can\'t be major characters, not even if you have the rest of the troop talk their heads off about them.","From my earliest years I had always wanted to be a writer. It was not that I had any particular message for humanity. I am still plugging away and not the ghost of one so far, so it begins to look as though, unless I suddenly hit mid-season form in my eighties, humanity will remain a message short.","I flung open the door. I got a momentary flash of about a hundred and fifteen cats of all sizes and colours scrapping in the middle of the room, and then they all shot past me with a rush and out of the front door; and all that was left of the mobscene was the head of a whacking big fish, lying on the carpet and staring up at me in a rather austere sort of way, as if it wanted a written explanation and apology.","[He] saw that a peculiar expression had come into his nephew\'s face; an expression a little like that of a young hindu fakir who having settled himself on his first bed of spikes is beginning to wish that he had chosen one of the easier religions.","A golfer needs a loving wife to whom he can describe the day\'s play through the long evening.","What earthly good is golf? Life is stern and life is earnest. We live in a practical age. All around us we see foreign competition making itself unpleasant. And we spend our time playing golf? What do we get out of it? Is golf any use? That\'s what I\'m asking you. Can you name me a single case where devotion to this pestilential pastime has done a man any practical good?","If you could call the thing a horse. If it hadn\'t shown a flash of speed in the straight, it would have got mixed up with the next race.","I don\u2019t know if you have had the same experience, but the snag I always come up against when I\u2019m telling a story is this dashed difficult problem of where to begin it.","When you\'re alone you don\'t do much laughing.","She had more curves than a scenic railway","I pressed down the mental accelerator. The old lemon throbbed fiercely. I got an idea.","Routine is the death to heroism.","But everything is relative, Bertie... You, for instance, are my relative, and I am your relative.","I don\'t want to wrong anybody, so I won\'t go so far as to say that she actually wrote poetry, but her conversation, to my mind, was of a nature calculated to excite the liveliest of suspicions. Well, I mean to say, when a girl suddenly asks you out of a blue sky if you don\'t sometimes feel that the stars are God\'s daisy-chain, you begin to think a bit.","She\'s one of those soppy girls, riddled from head to foot with whimsy. She holds the view that the stars are God\'s daisy chain, that rabbits are gnomes in attendance on the Fairy Queen, and that every time a fairy blows its wee nose a baby is born, which, as we know, is not the case. She\'s a drooper.","...it has been well said that it is precisely these moments when we are feeling that ours is the world and everything that\'s in it that Fate selects for sneaking up on us with the rock in the stocking.","I should think it extremely improbable that anyone ever wrote for money.

It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.","The cup of tea on arrival at a country house is a thing which, as a rule, I particularly enjoy. I like the crackling logs, the shaded lights, the scent of buttered toast, the general atmosphere of leisured cosiness.","While not exactly disgruntled, he was far from feeling gruntled. He spoke with a certain what-is-it in his voice, and I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled.","[I\'m] as broke as the ten commandments.","I am told by those who know that there are six varieties of hangover-the Broken Compass, the Sewing Machine, the Comet, the Atomic, the Cement Mixer and the Gremlin Boogie, and his manner suggested that he had got them all.","Into the face of the young man who sat on the terrace of the Hotel Magnifique at Cannes there had crept a look of furtive shame, the shifty, hangdog look which announces that an Englishman is about to talk French.","Half a league Half a league Half a league onward With a hey-nonny-nonny And a hot cha-cha.","The drowsy stillness of the afternoon was shattered by what sounded to his strained senses like G.K. Chesterton falling on a sheet of tin.","I never want to see anyone, and I never want to go anywhere or do anything. I just want to write.","I love writing.

I could not stop writing.","To say that New York came up to its advance billing would be the baldest of understatements. Being there was like being in heaven without going to all the bother and expense of dying.","Why don\'t you get a haircut? You look like a chrysanthemum.","He\'s like one of those weird birds in India who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where they want them.

The thing to do is to say to yourself, \'Which are my big scenes?\' and then get every drop of juice out of them. The principle I always go on in writing a novel is to think of the characters in terms of actors in a play. I say to myself, if a big name were playing this part, and if he found that after a strong first act he had practically nothing to do in the second act, he would walk out. Now, then, can I twist the story so as to give him plenty to do all the way through?","I suppose half the time Shakespeare just shoved down anything that came into his head.","Golf, like the measles, should be caught young, for, if postponed to riper years, the results may be serious.","I turned on the pillow with a little moan, and at this juncture Jeeves entered with the vital oolong. I clutched at it like a drowning man at a straw hat.","It was one of those cases where you approve the broad, general principle of an idea but can\'t help being in a bit of a twitter at the prospect of putting it into practical effect. I explained this to Jeeves, and he said much the same thing had bothered Hamlet.","If there is one thing I dislike, it is the man who tries to air his grievances when I wish to air mine.","I was writing a story, \'The Artistic Career of Corky,\' about two young men, Bertie Wooster and his friend Corky, getting into a lot of trouble, and neither of them had brains enough to get out of the trouble. I thought: Well, how can I get them out? And I thought: Suppose one of them had an omniscient valet?","Many a man may look respectable, and yet be able to hide at will behind a spiral staircase.","Love has had a lot of press-agenting from the oldest times; but there are higher, nobler things than love.","If it were not for quotations, conversations between gentlemen would consist of an endless series of \'what-ho!\'s.","There are three things in the world that he held in the smallest esteem - slugs, poets and caddies with hiccups.","It was one of those days you sometimes get latish in the autumn when the sun beams, the birds toot, and there is a bracing tang in the air that sends the blood beetling briskly through the veins.","Red hair, sir, in my opinion, is dangerous.","...smoking is just a habit. \'Tolstoy\', she said, mentioning someone I hadn\'t met, \'says that just as much pleasure can be got from twirling the fingers\'. My impulse was to tell her Tolstoy was off his onion, but I choked down the heated words. For all I know, the man might be a bosom pal of hers and she might resent criticism of him, however justified.","When you have been just told that the girl you love is definitely betrothed to another, you begin to understand how Anarchists must feel when the bomb goes off too soon.","The exquisite code of politeness of the Woosters prevented me clipping her one on the ear-hole, but I would have given a shilling to be able to do it. There seemed to me something deliberately fat-headed in the way she persisted in missing the gist.","She looked away. Her attitude seemed to suggest that she had finished with him, and would be obliged if somebody would come and sweep him up.","I am not always good and noble. I am the hero of this story, but I have my off moments.","The Duke of Dunstable had one-way pockets. He would walk ten miles in the snow to chisel an orphan out of tuppence.","It is the bungled crime that brings remorse.","Sudden success in golf is like the sudden acquisition of wealth. It is apt to unsettle and deteriorate the character.","The only way of really finding out a man\'s true character is to play golf with him. In no other walk of life does the cloven hoof so quickly display itself.","I don\'t know if you know it, J.B., but you\'re the sort of fellow who causes hundreds to fall under suspicion when he\'s found stabbed in his library with a paper-knife of Oriental design.","I don\'t want to seem always to be criticizing your methods of voice production, Jeeves, I said, but I must inform you that that \'Well, sir\' of yours is in many respects fully as unpleasant as your \'Indeed, sir?","She fitted into my biggest arm-chair as if it had been built round her by someone who knew they were wearing arm-chairs tight about the hips that season","Rex Stout\'s narrative and dialogue could not be improved, and he passes the supreme test of being rereadable. I don\'t know how many times I have reread the Wolfe stories, but plenty. I know exactly what is coming and how it is all going to end, but it doesn\'t matter. That\'s writing.","There\'s too much of that where-every-prospect-pleases-and-only-man-is-vile stuff buzzing around for my taste.","Hell, it is well known, has no fury like a woman who wants her tea and can\'t get it.","Oh, Jeeves,\' I said; \'about that check suit.\' Yes, sir?\' Is it really a frost?\' A trifle too bizarre, sir, in my opinion.\' But lots of fellows have asked me who my tailor is.\' Doubtless in order to avoid him, sir.\' He\'s supposed to be one of the best men in London.\' I am saying nothing against his moral character, sir.","Statisticians estimate that crime among good golfers is lower than in any class of the community except possibly bishops.","It is the glorious uncertainty of golf that makes it the game it is.","...there occurred to me the simple epitaph which, when I am no more, I intend to have inscribed on my tombstone. It was this: \\"He was a man who acted from the best motives. There is one born every minute.","It was a silver cow. But when I say \'cow\', don\'t go running away with the idea of some decent, self-respecting cudster such as you may observe loading grass into itself in the nearest meadow. This was a sinister, leering, Underworld sort of animal, the kind that would spit out of the side of its mouth for twopence.","It was a nasty look. It made me feel as if I were something the dog had brought in and intended to bury later on, when he had time.","I believe there are two ways of writing novels. One is mine, making a sort of musical comedy without music and ignoring real life altogether; the other is going right deep down into life and not caring a damn.","I can detach myself from the world. If there is a better world to detach oneself from than the one functioning at the moment I have yet to hear of it.","As for Gussie Finknottle, many an experienced undertaker would have been deceived by his appearance and started embalming on sight.","Beginning with a critique of my own limbs, which she said, justly enough, were nothing to write home about, this girl went on to dissect my manners, morals, intellect, general physique, and method of eating asparagus with such acerbity that by the time she had finished the best you could say of Bertram was that, so far as was known, he had never actually committed murder or set fire to an orphan asylum.","A roll and butter and a small coffee seemed the only things on the list that hadn\'t been specially prepared by the nastier-minded members of the Borgia family for people they had a particular grudge against, so I chose them.","One prefers, of course, on all occasions to be stainless and above reproach, but, failing that, the next best thing is unquestionably to have got rid of the body.","Men capable of governing empires fail to control a small white ball, which presents no difficulties whetever to others with one ounce more brain than a cuckoo clock. I wish to goodness I knew the man who invented this infernal game. I\'d strangle him. But I suppose he\'s been dead for ages. Still, I could go and jump on his grave.","I\'m all for rational enjoyment, and so forth, but I think a fellow makes himself conspicuous when he throws soft-boiled eggs at the electric fan","It was one of those parties where you cough twice before you speak and then decide not to say it after all.","There was the man who seemed to be attempting to decieve his ball and lull it into a false sense of security by looking away from it and then making a lightning slash in the apparent hope of catching it off its guard.","To persons of spirit like ourselves the only happy marriage is that which is based on a firm foundation of almost incessant quarrelling.","The storm is over, there is sunlight in my heart. I have a glass of wine and sit thinking of what has passed.","Employers are like horses \u2014 they require management.","I just sit at a typewriter and curse a bit.","Golf, like measles, should be caught young.","Woman is the unfathomable, incalculable mystery, the problem we men can never hope to solve.","There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action.","You would not enjoy Nietzsche, sir. He is fundamentally unsound.","Skiing consists of wearing $3,000 worth of clothes and equipment and driving 200 miles in the snow in order to stand around at a bar and drink.","Has anybody ever seen a dramatic critic in the daytime? Of course not. They come out after dark, up to no good.","To find a man\'s true character, play golf with him.","Just another proof, of course, of what I often say - it takes all sorts to make a world.","You probably think that being a guest in your aunt\'s house I would hesitate to butter you all over the front lawn and dance on the fragments in hobnailed boots, but you are mistaken.

They seem to take the stuffing right out of you. I mean to say, there is something about their personality that paralyses the vocal cords and reduces the contents of the brain to cauliflower.","You are falling into your old error, Jeeves, of thinking that Gussie is a parrot. Fight against this. I shall add the oz.","I am Psmith,\\" said the old Etonian reverently. \\"There is a preliminary P before the name. This, however, is silent. Like the tomb.

It merely mummifies its corpse.","That\'s always the way in this world.

It may be weak of me, but a man has only to speak to me, and a sort of thrill goes down my spine and sets my tail wagging.","As a rule, from what I\'ve observed, the American Captain of Industry doesn\'t do anything out of business hours. When he has put the cat out and locked up the office for the night, he just relapses into a state of coma from which he emerges only to start being a Captain of Industry again.","I never was interested in politics. I\'m quite unable to work up any kind of belligerent feeling. Just as I\'m about to feel belligerent about some country I meet a decent sort of chap. We go out together and lose any fighting thoughts or feelings.","Mr Howard Saxby, literary agent, was knitting a sock. He knitted a good deal, he would tell you if you asked him, to keep himself from smoking, adding that he also smoked a good deal to keep himself from knitting.","So always look for the silver lining And try to find the sunny side of life.","He shimmered out, and I sat up in bed with that rather unpleasant feeling you get sometimes that you\'re going to die in about five minutes.","Golf acts as a corrective against sinful pride. I attribute the insane arrogance of the later Roman Emperors almost entirely to the fact that, never having played golf, they never knew that strange chastening humility which is engendered by a topped chip shot. If Cleopatra had been ousted in the first round of the Ladies\' Singles, we should have heard a lot less of her proud imperiousness.","Well, you know, there are limits to the sacred claims of friendship.","It was a morning when all nature shouted Fore! The breeze, as it blew gently up from the valley, seemed to bring a message of hope and cheer, whispering of chip shots holed and brassies landing squarely on the meat. The fairway, as yet unscarred by the irons of a hundred dubs, smiled greenly up at the azure sky.","It would take more than long-stemmed roses to change my view that you\'re a despicable cowardy custard and a disgrace to a proud family. Your ancestors fought in the Crusades and were often mentioned in despatches, and you cringe like a salted snail at the thought of appearing as Santa Claus before an audience of charming children who wouldn\'t hurt a fly. It\'s enough to make an aunt turn her face to the wall and give up the struggle.","You would be miserable if you had to go through life with a human doormat with \'Welcome\' written on him. You want some one made of sterner stuff. You want, as it were, a sparring-partner, some one with whom you can quarrel happily with the certain knowledge that he will not curl up in a ball for you to kick, but will be there with the return wallop.","I expect I shall feel better after tea.","\\"After all, golf is only a game\\", said Millicent. Women say these things without thinking. It does not mean that there is any kink in their character. They simply don\'t realise what they are saying.","A girl who bonnets a policeman with an ashcan full of bottles is obviously good wife-and-mother timber.","It is not the being paid money in advance that jars the sensitive artist: it is the having to work.","I marmaladed a slice of toast with something of a flourish and I don\'t suppose I have ever come much closer to saying \'Tra la la\' as I did the lathering for I was feeling in mid season form this morning.","I suppose even Dictators have their chummy moments, when they put their feet up and relax with the boys, but it was plain from the outset that if Roderick Spode had a sunnier side, he had not come with any idea of exhibiting it now. His manner was curt. One sensed the absence of the bonhomous note. ... Here he laid a hand on my shoulder, and I can\'t remember when I have experienced anything more unpleasant. Apart from what Jeeves would have called the symbolism of the action, he had a grip like the bite of a horse. \\"Did you say \'Oh yes?\'\\" he asked. \\"Oh no,\\" I assured him.","Hugo?\u2019 \u2018Millicent?\u2019 \u2018Is that you?\u2019 \u2018Yes. Is that you?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 Anything in the nature of misunderstanding was cleared away. It was both of them.","But what is the love life of newts, if you boil it right down? Didn\'t you tell me once that they just waggled their tails at one another in the mating season?\'\'Quite correct.\' I shrugged my shoulders. \'Well all right, if they like it. But it\'s not my idea of molten passion.","Never put anything on paper, my boy, and never trust a man with a small black moustache.","The ideas of debtor and creditor as to what constitutes a good time never coincide.","We do not tell old friends beneath our roof-tree that they are an offence to the eyesight.","Gussie, a glutton for punishment, stared at himself in the mirror.","We Woosters freeze like the dickens when we seek sympathy and meet with cold reserve. \\"Nothing further Jeeves\\", I said with quiet dignity.","Well, you certainly are the most wonderfully woolly baa-lamb that ever stepped.","Confidence, of course is an admirable asset to a golfer, but it should be an unspoken confidence. It is perilous to put it into speech. The gods of golf lie in wait to chasten the presumptious.","Mr Beach was too well bred to be inquisitive, but his eyebrows here not. \'Ah!\' he said. \'?\', cried the eyebrows. \'? ? ?\' Ashe ignored the eyebrows. ... Mr Beach\'s eyebrows were still mutely urging him to reveal all, but Ashe directed his gaze at that portion of the room which Mr Beach did not fill. He was hanged if he was going to let himself be hypnotized by a pair of eyebrows into incriminating himself.","the ice was not only broken; it was shivered into a million fragments","I suppose he must have taken about a nine or something in hats. Shows what a rotten thing it is to let your brain develop too much.","He was one of those earnest, persevering dancers--the kind that have taken twelve correspondence lessons.","the supply of the milk of human kindness was short by several gallons","Lady Glossip: Mr. Wooster, how would you support a wife? Bertie Wooster: Well, I suppose it depends on who\'s wife it was, a little gentle pressure beneath the elbow while crossing a busy street usually fits the bill.","Birds, except when broiled and in the society of a cold bottle, bored him stiff.","I may as well tell you, here and now, that if you are going about the place thinking things pretty, you will never make a modern poet. Be poignant, man, be poignant!","I\'ve just discovered the secret of golf. You can\'t play a really hot game unless you\'re so miserable that you don\'t worry over your shots. Take the case of a chip shot, for instance. If you\'re really wretched, you don\'t care where the ball is going and so you don\'t raise your head to see. Grief automatically prevents pressing and over-swinging. Look at the top-notchers. Have you ever seen a happy pro?","Comedy is the kindly contemplation of the incongruous.","...there was practically one handwriting common to the whole school when it came to writing lines. It resembled the movements of a fly that had fallen into an ink-pot, and subsequently taken a little brisk exercise on a sheet of foolscap by way of restoring the circulation.","Judges, as a class, display, in the matter of arranging alimony, that reckless generosity which is found only in men who are giving away someone else\'s cash.","The trouble with cats is that they\'ve got no tact.","What is Love compared with holing out before your opponent?","Bicky rocked, like a jelly in a high wind.","As a rule, you see, I\'m not lugged into Family Rows. On the occasions when Aunt is calling Aunt like mastodons bellowing across premieval swamps and Uncle James\'s letter about Cousin Mabel\'s peculiar behaviour is being shot round the family circle (\'Please read this carefully and send it on Jane\') the clan has a tendency to ignore me. It\'s one of the advantages I get from being a bachelor - and, according to my nearest and dearest, practically a half-witted bachelor at that.","Whenever I have that sad, depressed feeling, I go out and kill a policeman.","I shuddered from stem to stern, as stout barks do when buffeted by the waves.","Slice him where you like, a hellhound is always a hellhound.","However devoutly a girl may worship the man of her choice, there always comes a time when she feels an irresistible urge to haul off and let him have it in the neck.","I wouldn\'t have a face like that,\' proceeded the child, with a good deal of earnestness, \'not if you gave me a million dollars.\' He thought for a moment, then corrected himself. \'Two million dollars!\' he added.","A man who has spent most of his adult life trying out a series of patent medicines is always an optimist.","If he had a mind, there was something on it.","His whole aspect was that of a man who has unexpectedly been struck by lightning.","When it comes to letting the world in on the secrets of his heart, he has about as much shrinking reticence as a steam calliope.","I started violently, as if some unseen hand had goosed me.","This Vladimir Brusiloff to whom I have referred was the famous Russian novelist. . . . Vladimir specialized in gray studies of hopeless misery, where nothing happened till page three hundred and eighty, when the moujik decided to commit suicide. . . . Cuthbert was an optimist at heart, and it seemed to him that, at the rate at which the inhabitants of that interesting country were murdering one another, the supply of Russian novelists must eventually give out.","I mean to say, I know perfectly well that I\'ve got, roughly speaking, half the amount of brain a normal bloke ought to possess. And when a girl comes along who has about twice the regular allowance, she too often makes a bee line for me with the love light in her eyes. I don\'t know how to account for it, but it is so.\\" \\"It may be Nature\'s provision for maintaining the balance of the species, sir.","You agreee with me that the situation is a lulu? Certainly, a somewhat sharp crisis in your affairs would appear to have been precipitated, Sir.","Jeeves, you really are a specific dream-rabbit.\\" \\"Thank you, miss.

If I wasn\'t so crazy about Marmaduke, I could really marry you Bertie.","I pity the shrimp that matches wits with you Jeeves","Well, there it is. That\'s Jeeves. Where others merely smite the brow and clutch the hair, he acts. Napoleon was the same.","In a series of events, all of which had been a bit thick, this, in his opinion, achieved the maximum of thickness.","In your walks about London you will sometimes see bent, haggard figures that look as if they had recently been caught in some powerful machinery. They are those fellows who got mixed up with Catsmeat when he was meaning well.","She\'s a sort of human vampire-bat","I clutched at the brow. The mice in my interior had now got up an informal dance and were buck-and-winging all over the place like a bunch of Nijinskys.","We Woosters do not lightly forget. At least, we do - some things - appointments, and people\'s birthdays, and letters to post, and all that - but not an absolutely bally insult like the above.","Psmith is the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a plate with watercress round it, thus enabling me to avoid the blood, sweat and tears inseparable from an author\'s life.","He groaned slightly and winced like Prometheus watching his vulture dropping in for lunch.","The stationmaster\'s whiskers are of a Victorian bushiness and give the impression of having been grown under glass.","It\'s not that I don\'t trust you, Dunstable, it\'s simply that I don\'t trust you.","A lesser moustache, under the impact of that quick, agonised expulsion of breath, would have worked loose at the roots.","I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled.","I\'m bound to say that New York\'s a topping place to be exiled in. Everybody was awfully good to me, and there seemed to be plenty of things going on, and I\'m a wealthy bird, so everything was fine.","One of the rummy things about Jeeves is that, unless you watch like a hawk, you very seldom see him come into a room.","Great pals we\'ve always been. In fact there was a time when I had an idea I was in love with Cynthia. However, it blew over. A dashed pretty and lively and attractive girl, mind you, but full of ideals and all that. I may be wronging her, but I have an idea that she\'s the sort of girl who would want a fellow to carve out a career and what not. I know I\'ve heard her speak favourably of Napoleon. So what with one thing and another the jolly old frenzy sort of petered out, and now we\'re just pals. I think she\'s a topper, and she thinks me next door to a looney, so everything\'s nice and matey.","Joan was nothing more than a friend. He was not in love with her. One does not fall in love with a girl whom one has met only three times. One is attracted, yes; but one does not fall in love. A moment\'s reflection enabled him to diagnose his sensations correctly. This odd impulse to leap across the compartment and kiss Joan was not love. It was merely the natural desire of a good-hearted young man to be decently chummy with his species.","The cosy glow which had been enveloping the Duke became shot through by a sudden chill. It was as if he had been luxuriating in a warm shower bath, and some hidden hand had turned on the cold tap.","Few of them were to be trusted within reach of a trowel and a pile of bricks.","Golf is the Great Mystery.","I am strongly of the opinion that, after the age of twenty-one, a man ought not to be out of bed and awake at four in the morning. The hour breeds thought. At twenty-one, life being all future, it may be examined with impunity. But, at thirty, having become an uncomfortable mixture of future and past, it is a thing to be looked at only when the sun is high and the world full of warmth and optimism.","They were real golfers, for real golf is a thing of the spirit, not of mere mechanical excellence of stroke.","Do men who have got all their marbles go swimming in lakes with their clothes on?","I remember her telling me once that rabbits were the gnomes in attendance to the Fairy Queen and that the stars were God\'s daisy chain. Perfect rot, of course.","It is never difficult to distinguish between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine.","Golf is the Great Mystery. Like some capricous goddess, it bestows its favours with what would appear an almost fat-headed lack of method and discrimination. On every side we see big two-fisted he-men floundering round in three figures, stopping every few minutes to let through little shrimps with knock-knees and hollow cheeks, who are tearing up snappy seventy-fours.","And, anyway, no matter how much you may behave like the deaf adder of Scripture which, as you are doubtless aware, the more one piped, the less it danced, or words to that effect, I shall carry on as planned.","Many bad golfers marry, feeling that a wife\'s loving solicitude may improve their game. But they are rugged, thick-skinned men, not sensitive and introspective. It is one of the chief merits of golf that non-success at the game induces a certain amount of decent humilty, which keeps a man from pluming himself too much on any petty triumphs he may achieve in other walks of life.","It looked something like a pen wiper and something like a piece of hearth-rug. A second and keener inspection revealed it as a Pekinese puppy.","What I\'m worrying about is what Tom is going to say when he starts talking.\\" \\"Uncle Tom?\\" \\"I wish there was something else you could call him except \'Uncle Tom,\' \\" Aunt Dahlia said a little testily. \\"Every time you do it, I expect to see him turn black and start playing the banjo.","...what I feel we ought to do at this juncture is to dash off somewhere where it\'s quiet and there aren\'t so many housesdancing the \'Blue Danube\' and shove some tea into ourselves. And over the pot and muffins I shall have something veryimportant to say to you.","Back horses or go down to Throgmorton Street and try to take it away from the Rothschilds, and I will applaud you as a shrewd and cautious financier. But to bet at golf is pure gambling.","He enjoys that perfect peace, that peace beyond all understanding, which comes to its maximum only to the man who has given up golf.","Providence seems to look after the chumps of this world; and, personally, I\'m all for it.","When Cynthia smiles, said young Bingo, the skies are blue; the world takes on a roseate hue; birds in the garden trill and sing, and Joy is king of everything, when Cynthia smiles. He coughed, changing gears. When Cynthia frowns - What the devil are you talking about?I\'m reading you my poem. The one I wrote to Cynthia last night. I\'ll go on, shall I?No!No?No. I haven\'t had my tea.","It was one of the most disgusting spectacles I\'ve ever seen-- this white-haired old man, who should have been thinking of the hereafter, standing there lying like an actor.","It is not mere technical skill that makes a man a golfer, it is the golfing soul.","New York is a small place when it comes to the part of it that wakes up just as the rest is going to bed.","They pointed out that the friendship between the two artists had always been a byword or whatever you called it. A well-read Egg summed it up by saying that they were like Thingummy and what\'s-his-name.","Say what you will, there is something fine about our old aristocracy. I\'ll bet Trotsky couldn\'t hit a moving secretary with an egg on a dark night.","Love is a delicate plant that needs constant tending and nurturing, and this cannot be done by snorting at the adored object like a gas explosion and calling her friends lice.","No novelists any good except me. Sovietski -- yah! Nastikoff -- bah! I spit me of zem all. No novelists anywhere any good except me. P. G. Wodehouse and Tolstoi not bad. Not good, but not bad. No novelists any good except me.","Warm-hearted! I should think he has to wear asbestos vests!","I shoved on a dressing-gown, and flew downstairs like a mighty, rushing wind.","Why do dachshunds wear their ears inside out?","Other men puffed, snorted, and splashed. George passed through the ocean with the silent dignity of a torpedo. Other men swallowed water, here a mouthful, there a pint, anon, maybe, a quart or so, and returned to the shore like foundering derelicts. George\'s mouth had all the exclusiveness of a fashionable club. His breast stroke was a thing to see and wonder at. When he did the crawl, strong men gasped. When he swam on his back, you felt that that was the only possible method of progression.","Bertie,\\" he said, \\"I want your advice.\\" \\"Carry on.\\" \\"At least, not your advice, because that wouldn\'t be much good to anybody.

Not that I want to hurt your feelings, of course.\\" \\"No, no, I see that.\\" \\"What I wish you to do is put the whole thing to that fellow Jeeves of yours, and see what he suggests.","There are moments, Jeeves, when one asks oneself, \'Do trousers matter?\'\\"\\"The mood will pass, sir.","What ho!\\" I said.\\"What ho!\\" said Motty.\\"What ho! What ho!\\"\\"What ho! What ho!

It is called the guillotine.","I just sit at my typewriter and curse a bit.","Oh, Jeeves,\' I said; \'about that check suit.\'Yes, sir?\'Is it really a frost?\'A trifle too bizarre, sir, in my opinion.\'But lots of fellows have asked me who my tailor is.\'Doubtless in order to avoid him, sir.\'He\'s supposed to be one of the best men in London.\'I am saying nothing against his moral character, sir.","Whenever I get that sad, depressed feeling, I go out and kill a policeman.","I mean to say, I know perfectly well that I\'ve got, roughly speaking, half the amount of brain a normal bloke ought to possess.

Well may I get aboard! This is the chase: I am gone for ever.And then comes literature\'s most famous stage direction, \\"Exit pursued by a bear.\\" All well and good, but here\'s the way I would handle it:BERTIE: Touch of indigestion, Jeeves?JEEVES: No, Sir.BERTIE: Then why is your tummy rumbling?JEEVES: Pardon me, Sir, the noise to which you allude does not emanate from my interior but from that of that animal that has just joined us.BERTIE: Animal? What animal?JEEVES: A bear, Sir. If you will turn your head, you will observe that a bear is standing in your immediate rear inspecting you in a somewhat menacing manner.BERTIE (as narrator): I pivoted the loaf. The honest fellow was perfectly correct. It was a bear. And not a small bear, either. One of the large economy size. Its eye was bleak and it gnashed a tooth or two, and I could see at a g. that it was going to be difficult for me to find a formula. \\"Advise me, Jeeves,\\" I yipped. \\"What do I do for the best?\\"JEEVES: I fancy it might be judicious if you were to make an exit, Sir.BERTIE (narrator): No sooner s. than d.

I\'d always thought of Jeeves as a kind of natural phenomenon; but, by Jove! of course, when you come to think of it, there must be quite a lot of fellows who have to press their own clothes themselves and haven\'t got anybody to bring them tea in the morning, and so on.

Now, then, can I twist the story so as to give him plenty to do all the way through? I believe the only way a writer can keep himself up to the mark is by examining each story quite coldly before he starts writing it and asking himself it is all right as a story.

You look like a bereaved tapeworm.","Half a leagueHalf a leagueHalf a league onwardWith a hey-nonny-nonnyAnd a hot cha-cha.","On the occasions when Aunt is calling Aunt like mastodons bellowing across primeval swamps...","It has never been hard to tell the difference between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine.","There is no time, sir, at which ties do not matter.","Bertie,\\" he said, \\"I want your advice.\\"\\"Carry on.\\"\\"At least, not your advice, because that wouldn\'t be much good to anybody. I mean, you\'re a pretty consummate old [prat], aren\'t you? Not that I want to hurt your feelings, of course.\\"\\"No, no, I see that.\\"\\"What I wish you to do is put the whole thing to that fellow Jeeves of yours, and see what he suggests.","I read the paragraph again. A peculiar feeling it gave me. I don\'t know if you have ever experienced the sensation of seeing the announcement of the engagement of a pal of yours to a girl whom you were only saved from marrying yourself by the skin of your teeth. It induces a sort of -- well, it\'s difficult to describe it exactly; but I should imagine a fellow would feel much the same if he happened to be strolling through the jungle with a boyhood chum and met a tigress or a jaguar, or what not, and managed to shin up a tree and looked down and saw the friend of his youth vanishing into the undergrowth in the animal\'s slavering jaws. A sort of profound, prayerful relief, if you know what I mean, blended at the same time with a pang of pity. What I\'m driving at is that, thankful as I was that I hadn\'t had to marry Honoria myself, I was sorry to see a real good chap like old Biffy copping it. I sucked down a spot of tea and began brooding over the business.","What are the chances of a cobra biting Harold, Jeeves?\\"\\"Slight, I should imagine, sir. And in such an event, knowing the boy as intimately as I do, my anxiety would be entirely for the snake.","She came leaping towards me, like Lady Macbeth coming to get first-hand news from the guest-room.","The awful part of the writing game is that you can never be sure the stuff is any good.","She laughed - a bit louder than I could have wished in my frail state of health, but then she is always a woman who tends to bring plaster falling from the ceiling when amused.","[Aunt Dahlia to Bertie Wooster] \'To look at you, one would think you were just an ordinary sort of amiable idiot--certifiable, perhaps, but quite harmless. Yet, in reality, you are worse a scourge than the Black Death. I tell you, Bertie, when I contemplate you I seem to come up against all the underlying sorrow and horror of life with such a thud that I feel as if I had walked into a lamp post. I thought as much. Well, it needed but this. I don\'t see how things could possibly be worse than they are, but no doubt you will succeed in making them so. Your genius and insight will find the way. Carry on, Bertie. Yes, carry on. I am past caring now. I shall even find a faint interest in seeing into what darker and profounder abysses of hell you can plunge this home. Go to it, lad..I remember years ago, when you were in your cradle, being left alone with you one day and you nearly swallowed your rubber comforter and started turning purple. And I, ass that I was, took it out and saved your life. Let me tell you, young Bertie, it will go very hard with you if you ever swallow a rubber comforter again when only I am by to aid.","I\'ve found, as a general rule of life, that the things you think are going to be the scaliest nearly always turn out not so bad after all.","I suppose even Dictators have their chummy moments, when they put their feet up and relax with the boys, but it was plain from the outset that if Roderick Spode had a sunnier side, he had not come with any idea of exhibiting it now. His manner was curt. One sensed the absence of the bonhomous note....Here he laid a hand on my shoulder, and I can\'t remember when I have experienced anything more unpleasant. Apart from what Jeeves would have called the symbolism of the action, he had a grip like the bite of a horse.\\"Did you say \'Oh yes?\'\\" he asked.\\"Oh no,\\" I assured him.","Mr Wisdom,\' said the girl who had led him into the presence.\'Ah,\' said Howard Saxby, and there was a pause of perhaps three minutes, during which his needles clicked busily. \'Wisdom, did she say?\'\'Yes. I wrote \\"Cocktail Time\\"\'\'You couldn\'t have done better,\' said Mr Saxby cordially. \'How\'s your wife, Mr Wisdom?\'Cosmo said he had no wife.\'Surely?\'\\"I\'m a bachelor.\'Then Wordsworth was wrong. He said you were married to immortal verse. Excuse me a moment,\' murmured Mr Saxby, applying himself to the sock again. \'I\'m just turning the heel. Do you knit?\'\'No.\'\'Sleep does. It knits the ravelled sleave of care.\'(After a period of engrossed knitting, Cosmo coughs loudly to draw attention to his presence.)\'Goodness, you made me jump!\' he (Saxby) said. \'Who are you?\'\'My name, as I have already told you, is Wisdom\'\'How did you get in?\' asked Mr Saxby with a show of interest.\'I was shown in.\'\'And stayed in. I see, Tennyson was right. Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers. Take a chair.\'\'I have.\'\'Take another,\' said Mr Saxby hospitably.","Don\'t leave me, Bertie. I\'m lost.\\"\\"What do you mean, lost?\\"\\"I came out for a walk and suddenly discovered after a mile or two that I didn\'t know where on earth I was. I\'ve been wandering round in circles for hours.\\"\\"Why didn\'t you ask the way?\\"\\"I can\'t speak a word of French.\\"\\"Well, why didn\'t you call a taxi?\\"\\"I suddenly discovered I\'d left all my money at my hotel.\\"\\"You could have taken a cab and paid it when you got to the hotel.\\"\\"Yes, but I suddenly discovered, dash it, that I\'d forgotten its name.\\"And there in a nutshell you have Charles Edward Biffen. As vague and woollen-headed a blighter as ever bit a sandwich.","These dreamer types do live, don\'t they?","as if Nature had intended to make a gorilla, and had changed its mind at the last moment","The funny thing was that he wasn\'t altogether a fool in other ways. Deep down in him there was a kind of stratum of sense. I had known him, once or twice, show an almost human intelligence. But to reach that stratum, mind you, you needed dynamite.","I\'m a bit short on brain myself; the old bean would appear to have been constructed more for ornament than for use, don\'t you know...","There is, of course, this to be said for the Omnibus Book in general and this one in particular. When you buy it, you have got something. The bulk of this volume makes it almost the ideal paper-weight. The number of its pages assures its posessor of plenty of shaving paper on his vacation. Place upon the waistline and jerked up and down each morning, it will reduce embonpoint and strengthen the abdominal muscles. And those still at their public school will find that between, say, Caesar\'s Commentaries in limp cloth and this Jeeves book there is no comparison as a missile in an inter-study brawl.","Am taking legal advice to ascertain whether strangling an idiot nephew counts as murder. If it doesn\'t look out for yourself.","When Cynthia smiles,\\" said young Bingo, \\"the skies are blue; the world takes on a roseate hue; birds in the garden trill and sing, and Joy is king of everything, when Cynthia smiles.\\" He coughed, changing gears. \\"When Cynthia frowns - \\"\\"What the devil are you talking about?\\"\\"I\'m reading you my poem. The one I wrote to Cynthia last night. I\'ll go on, shall I?\\"\\"No!\\"\\"No?\\"\\"No. I haven\'t had my tea.","No, I am quite content with you, Bertie. By the way, I do dislike that name Bertie. I think I shall call you Harold. Yes, I am perfectly satisfied with you. You have many faults, of course. I shall be pointing some of them out when I am at leisure.","The true philosopher is a man who says \\"All right,\\" and goes to sleep in his armchair.","I really preferred to walk. I have only just landed in England from New York, and it\'s quite a treat to walk on an English country road again.","I don\'t know why it is, but women who have anything to do with Opera, even if they\'re only studying for it, always appear to run to surplus poundage.","Honoria, you see, is one of those robust, dynamic girls with the muscles of a welter-weight and a laugh like a squadron of cavalry charging over a tin bridge. A beastly thing to have to face over the breakfast table. Brainy, moreover. The sort of girl who reduces you to pulp with sixteen sets of tennis and a few rounds of golf and then comes down to dinner as fresh as a daisy, expecting you to take an intelligent interest in Freud.","I say, Bertie, is it really true that you were once engaged to Honoria?\\"\\"It is.\\"Biffy coughed.\\"How did you get out - I mean, what was the nature of the tragedy that prevented the marriage?\\"\\"Jeeves worked it. He thought out the entire scheme.\\"\\"I think, before I go,\\" said Biffy thoughtfully, \\"I\'ll just step into the kitchen and have a word with Jeeves.\\"I felt that the situation called for complete candour.\\"Biffy, old egg,\\" I said, \\"as man to man, do you want to oil out of this thing?\\"\\"Bertie, old cork,\\" said Biffy earnestly, \\"as one friend to another, I do.","In his normal state he would not strike a lamb.

You see, my own takes up such a lot of the foreground","[T]he success of every novel -- if it\'s a novel of action -- depends on the high spots. The thing to do is to say to yourself, \\"What are my big scenes?\\" and then get every drop of juice out of them.\\"(Interview, The Paris Review, Issue 64, Winter 1975)","Success comes to a writer, as a rule, so gradually that it is always something of a shock to him to look back and realize the heights to which he has climbed.","Conversationally, I am like a clockwork toy. I have to be set going.","Sir? said Jeeves, kind of manifesting himself. One of the rummy things about Jeeves is that, unless you watch like a hawk, you very seldom see him come into a room. He\u2019s like one of those weird chappies in India who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where they want them. I\u2019ve got a cousin who\u2019s what they call a Theosophist, and he says he\u2019s often nearly worked the thing himself, but couldn\u2019t quite bring it off, probably owing to having fed in his boyhood on the flesh of animals slain in anger and pie.\u201d","Liz,\\" said Mr. Cootes, lost in admiration, \\"when it comes to doping out a scheme, you\'re the snake\'s eyebrows!","He picked up one of the dead bats and covered it with his handkerchief. \u2018Somebody\u2019s mother,\u2019 he murmured reverently.","The discovery of some toy duck in the soap dish, presumably the property of some former juvenile visitor, contributed not a little to this new and happier frame of mind. What with one thing and another, I hadn\'t played with toy ducks in my bath for years, and I found the novel experience most invigorating. For the benefit of those interested, I may mention that if you shove the thing under the surface with the sponge and then let it go, it shoots out of the water in a manner calculated to divert the most careworn. Ten minutes of this and I was enabled to return to the bedchamber much more the merry old Bertram.","The trouble with you, Spode, is that just because you have succeeded in inducing a handful of half-wits to disfigure the London scene by going about in black shorts, you think you\'re someone. You hear them shouting \\"Heil, Spode!\\" and you imagine it is the Voice of the People. That is where you make your bloomer. What the Voice of the People is saying is: \\"Look at that frightful ass Spode swanking about in footer bags! Did you ever in your puff see such a perfect perisher?","One of the advantages a sister has when arguing with a brother is that she is under no obligation to be tactful. If she wishes to tell him that he is an idiot and ought to have his head examined, she can do so and, going further, can add that it is a thousand pities that no-one ever thought of smothering him with a pillow in his formative years.","Suiffy, have you ever felt a sort of strange emptiness in the heart? A sort of aching void of the soul?\'\'Oh, rather!\'\'What do you do about it?\'\'I generally take a couple of cocktails.","Love, Miss Halliday, is a delicate plant. It needs tending, nurturing, assiduous fostering. This cannot be done by throwing the breakfast bacon at a husband\'s head.","The proprietor of the grocery store on the corner was bidding a silent farewell to a tomato which even he, though a dauntless optimist, had been compelled to recognize as having outlived its utility.","She was at the valiant age when we burn to right wrongs and succour the oppressed,","Remember what the poet Shakespeare said, Jeeves? \'Exit hurriedly, pursued by a bear.\' You\'ll find it in one of his plays.","You can\'t go by what a girl says, when she\'s giving you the devil for making a chump of yourself. It\'s like Shakespeare. Sounds well, but doesn\'t mean anything.","Angela nearly got inhaled by a shark while aquaplaning.","You remind me of an old cat I once had. Whenever he killed a mouse he would bring it into the drawing-room and lay it affectionately at my feet. I would reject the corpse with horror and turn him out, but back he would come with his loathsome gift. I simply couldn\u2019t make him understand that he was not doing me a kindness. He thought highly of his mouse and it was beyond him to realize that I did not want it.You are just the same with your chivalry. It\u2019s very kind of you to keep offering me your dead mouse; but honestly I have no use for it. I won\u2019t take favors just because I happen to be a female.","Feminine psychology is admittedly odd, sir. The poet Pope...\\"\\"Never mind about the poet Pope, Jeeves.\\"\\"No, sir.\\"\\"There are times when one wants to hear all about the poet Pope and times when one doesn\'t.\\"\\"Very true, sir.","Well, the fact is,\\" said Celia, in a burst of girlish frankness, \\"Irather think I\'ve killed George.\\"Killed him, eh?\\"It was a solution that had not occurred to me, but now that it waspresented for my inspection I could see its merits. In these days ofnational effort, when we are all working together to try to make ourbeloved land fit for heroes to live in, it was astonishing that nobodybefore had thought of a simple, obvious thing like killing GeorgeMackintosh. George Mackintosh was undoubtedly better dead, but it hadtaken a woman\'s intuition to see it.I killed him with my niblick,\\" said Celia.I nodded. If the thing was to be done at all, it was unquestionably aniblick shot.","Filled with a coward rage that dares to burn but does not dare to blaze, Lord Emsworth coughed a cough that was undisguisedly a bronchial white flag.","The object of all good literature is to purge the soul of its petty troubles.","Jeeves, Mr Little is in love with that female.\\"\\"So I gathered, sir. She was slapping him in the passage.\\"I clutched my brow.\\"Slapping him?\\"\\"Yes, sir. Roguishly.","I believe there are two ways of writing novels. One is making a sort of musical comedy without music and ignoring real life altogether; the other is going deep down into life and not caring a damn...","Sturgis had now become involved in a long story of his early manhood, and even had Soapy been less distrait he might have found it difficult to enjoy it to the full. It was about an acquaintance of his who had kept rabbits, and it suffered in lucidity from his unfortunate habit of pronouncing rabbits \'roberts\', combined with the fact that by a singular coincidence the acquaintance had been a Mr. Roberts. Roberts, it seemed, had been deeply attached to roberts. In fact, his practice of keeping roberts in his bedroom had led to trouble with Mrs. Roberts, and in the end Mrs. Roberts had drowned the roberts in the pond and Roberts, who thought the world of his roberts and not quite so highly of Mrs. Roberts, had never forgiven her.","You can\'t be a successful dictator and design women\'s underwear. One or the other. Not both.","It is never difficult to distinguish between with a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine.","She was one of those women who kind of numb a fellow\'s faculties. She made me feel as if I were ten years old and had been brought into the drawing-room in my Sunday clothes to say how-d\'you-do.","I was in that painful condition which occurs when one has lost one\'s first wind and has not yet got one\'s second.","Aunt Agatha\'s demeanor now was rather like that of one who, picking daisies on the railway, has just caught the down express in the small of the back.","The fact that pigs were abroad in the night seemed to bring home to me the perilous nature of my enterprise.","Bream Mortimer was tall and thin. He had small bright eyes and a sharply curving nose. He looked much more like a parrot than most parrots do. It gave strangers a momentary shock of surprise when they saw Bream Mortimer in restaurants, eating roast beef. They had the feeling that he would have preferred sunflower seeds.","There is a fog, sir. If you will recollect, we are now in Autumn \u2013 season of mists and mellow fruitfulness.","Billie knew all. And, terrible though the fact is as an indictment of the male sex, when a woman knows all, there is invariably trouble ahead for some man.","It\'s and odd thing, but however much an  oficionado one may be of mysteries in book form, when they pop up in real life they seldom fail to give one the pip.","He looked like a vulture dissatisfied with its breakfast corpse.","I wonder the food didn\'t turn to ashes in our mouths! Eggs! Muffins! Sardines! All wrung from the bleeding lips of the starving poor!\\"\\"Oh, I say! What a beastly idea!\\"...Jeeves came in to clear away, and found me sitting among the ruins. It was all very well for Comrade Butt to knock the food, but he had pretty well finished the ham; and if you had shoved the remainder of the jam into the bleeding lips of the starving poor it would hardly have made them sticky.","She was, in short, melted by his distress, as so often happens with the female sex. Poets have frequently commented on this. You are probably familiar with the one who said, \\"Oh, woman in our hours of ease tum tumty tiddly something please, when something something something brow, a something something something thou.","Gussie and I, as I say, had rather lost touch, but all the same I was exercised about the poor fish, as I am about all my pals, close or distant, who find themselves treading upon Life\'s banana skins.","There\'s no doubt about it, being a policeman warps a man\'s mind and ruins that sunny faith in his fellow human beings which is the foundation of a lovable character. There seems to be no way of avoiding this.","The boy is of an outspoken disposition, and had made an opprobrious remark respecting my personal appearance.\\"\\"What did he say about your appearance?\\"\\"I have forgotten, sir,\\" said Jeeves, with a touch of austerity. \\"But it was opprobrious.","If she ever turned into a werewolf, it would be one of those jolly breezy werewolves whom it is a pleasure to know.","A chap\'s bedroom \u2013 you can\'t get way from it \u2013 is his castle, and he has every right to look askance if gargoyles come glaring in at him.","Wait a minute while I think,\\" said Miss Peavey. There was a pause. Miss Peavey sat with knit brows.\\"How would it be...\\" ventured Mr. Cootes.\\"Cheese it!\\" said Miss Peavey.Mr. Cootes cheesed it.","Good Lord, Jeeves! Is there anything you don\u2019t know?\u2019 \u2018I couldn\u2019t say, sir.","He was in the frame of mind when a weaker man would have started writing poetry.","You won\'t mind my calling you Comrade, will you? I\'ve just become a socialist. It\'s a great scheme. You ought to be one. You work for the equal distribution of property, and start by collaring all you can and sitting on it.","It seems to be one of Nature\u2019s laws that the most attractive girls should have the least attractive brothers. Fillmore Nicholas had not worn well. At the age of seven he had been an extraordinarily beautiful child, but after that he had gone all to pieces; and now, at the age of twenty-five, it would be idle to deny that he was something of a mess.","I say, you don\'t know how I could raise fifty quid somehow, do you?\\"\\"Why don\'t you work?\\"\\"Work?\\" said young Bingo, surprised. \\"What, me? No, I shall have to think of some way.","If ever there was a bloke at the very mention of whose name it would be excusable for people to tremble like aspens, that bloke is Sir Roderick Glossop. He has an enormous bald head, all the hair which ought to be on it seeming to have run into his eyebrows, and his eyes go through you like a couple of Death Rays.\\"How are you, how are you, how are you?\\" I said, overcoming a slight desire to leap backwards out of the window.","You can\u2019t tell me if there are any special subjects to avoid when talking to him, can you?\u2019 \u2018Special subjects?\u2019 \u2018Well, you know how it is with a stranger. You say it\u2019s a fine day, and he goes all white and tense, because you\u2019ve reminded him that it was on a fine day that his wife eloped with the chauffeur.","But then, at meals, my attention is pretty well riveted on the foodstuffs.","My Aunt Dahlia, who runs a woman\'s paper called Milady\'s Boudoir, had recently backed me into a corner and made me promise to write her a few words for her \\"Husbands and Brothers\\" page on \\"What the Well-Dressed Man is Wearing\\". I believe in encouraging aunts, when deserving; and, as there are many worse eggs than her knocking about the metrop, I had consented blithely. But I give you my honest word that if I had had the foggiest notion of what I was letting myself in for, not even a nephew\'s devotion would have kept me from giving her the raspberry. A deuce of a job it had been, taxing the physique to the utmost. I don\'t wonder now that all these author blokes have bald heads and faces like birds who have suffered.","I couldn\'t have made a better shot, if I had been one of those detectives who see a chap walking along the street and deduce that he is a retired manufacturer of poppet valves named Robinson with rheumatism in one arm, living at Clapham.","Just as you say, sir. There is a letter on the tray, sir.\\"\\"By Jove, Jeeves, that was practically potry. Rhymed, did you notice?","Musical comedy is the Irish stew of drama. Anything may be put into it, with the certainty that it will improve the general effect.","There is enough sadness in life without having fellows like Gussie Fink-Nottle going about in sea boots.","You can\u2019t fling the hands up in a passionate gesture when you are driving a car at fifty miles an hour. Otherwise, I should have done so.","Hear that, Eustace? He wishes we were staying a good long time.\\"\\"I expect it will seem a good long time,\\" said Eustace, philosophically.","INTERVIEWERHave you ever been envious of another writer?WODEHOUSENo, never. I\u2019m really such a voracious reader that I\u2019m only too grateful to get some stuff I can read.","I\'m much too much the popular pet ever since I sang \'Every Nice Girl Loves A Sailor\' at the village concert last year. I had them rolling in the aisles. Three encores, and so many bows that I got a crick in the back.\\"\\"Spare me the tale of your excesses,\\" I said distantly.\\"I wore a sailor suit.\\"\\"Please,\\" I said, revolted.","If I might suggest, sir\u2014it is, of course, merely a palliative\u2014but it has often been found in times of despondency that the assumption of formal evening dress has a stimulating effect on the morale.","To my daughter Leonora without whose never-failing sympathy and encouragement this book would have been finished in half the time.","You see, the catch about portrait painting\u2014I\'ve looked into the thing a bit\u2014 is that you can\'t startpainting portraits till people come along and ask you to, andthey won\'t come and ask you to until you\'ve painted a lot first.This makes it kind of difficult for a chappie.","Too often on such occasions one feels, as I feel so strongly with regard to poor old Stilton, that the kindly thing to do would be to seize the prospective bridegroom\'s trousers in one\'s teeth and draw him back from danger, as faithful dogs do to their masters on the edge of precipices on dark nights.","Aunts Aren\'t Gentlemen","He keeps looking at me so oddly.\u201cOddly? How? Give me an imitation.\u201dConsidering that she had only about a second and a half to do it in, I must say it was a jolly fine exhibition. She opened her mouth and eyes pretty wide and let her jaw drop sideways, and managed to look so like a dyspeptic calf that I recognized the symptoms immediately.\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right,\u201d I said. \u201cNo need to be alarmed. He\u2019s simply in love with you.\u201d","He couldn\u2019t have moved quicker if he had been the dachshund Poppet, who at this juncture was running round in circles, trying, if I read his thoughts aright, to work off the rather heavy lunch he had had earlier in the afternoon.","One of the King Georges of England\u2013I forget which\u2013once said that a certain number of hours\u2019 sleep each night\u2013I cannot recall at the moment how many\u2013made a man something, which for the time being has slipped my memory.","What with one thing and another, I can\'t remember ever having been chirpier than at about this period in my career. Everything seemed to be going right. On three separate occasions horses on which I\'d invested a sizeable amount won by lengths instead of sitting down to rest in the middle of the race, as horses usually do when I\'ve got money on them. ~ Bertram \\"Bertie\\" Wooster - The Inimitable Jeeves","Didn\'t Frankenstein get married?\\"\\"Did he?\\" said Eggy. \\"I don\'t know.

I mean, what am I? Ask yourself that.\\"\\"I often have.","He looked like a Dictator on the point of starting a purge.","It\'s brain,\\" I said; \\"pure brain!

I should think he has to wear asbestos vests.","I merely called for my hat and stick in a marked manner and legged it. But the memory rankled, if you know what I mean. We Woosters do not lightly forget. At least, we do - some things - appointments, and people\'s birthdays, and letters to post, and all that - but not an absolute bally insult like the above. I brooded like the dickens.","But when I say \'cow\', don\u2019t go running away with the idea of some decent, self-respecting cudster such as you may observe loading grass into itself in the nearest meadow.","What I mean is, if you\'re absolutely off your rocker, but don\'t find it convenient to be scooped into the luny-bin, you simply explain that, when you said you were a teapot, it was just your Artistic Temperament, and they apologize and go away. So I stood by to hear just how the A.T. had affected Clarence, the Cat\'s Friend, ready for anything.","I shuttered from hairdo to shoe-sole","Apparently that dog of hers joined you in the water.Yes, that\u2019s right, he took his dip with the rest of us.

Old Bittlesham was bound to knock off his allowance if he did anything of the sort and, with a fellow like young Bingo, if you knocked off his allowance, you might just as well hit him on the head with an axe and make a clean job of it.","In the spring, Jeeves, a livelier iris gleams upon the burnished dove.\\"\\"So I have been informed, sir.\\"\\"Right ho!

That\'s how near I get to it.","The Paddock was one of those medium-sized houses with a goodish bit of very tidy garden and a carefully rolled gravel drive curving past a shrubbery that looked as if it had just come back from the dry cleaner - the sort of house you take one look at and say to yourself, \\"Somebody\'s aunt lives there.","Change of scene is the thing. I head of a man. Girl refused him. Man went abroad. Two months later girl wired him \\"Come back, Muriel.\\" Man started to write out a reply; suddenly found that he couldn\'t remember girl\'s surname; so never answered at all, and lived happily ever after.","She spoke as if she belonged to an anti-sausage society or a league for the suppression of eggs.","Don\u2019t they put aunts in Turkey in sacks and drop them in the Bosphorus?\u2019 \u2018Odalisques, sir, I understand.

But why football boots?\\"\\"Perhaps Mr. Glossop wishes to play football, sir.","Did you ever tread on your partner\'s dress at a dance - I\'m speaking now of the days when women wore dresses long enough to be trodden on - and hear it rip and see her smile at you like an angel and say, \\"Please don\'t apologise. It\'s nothing,\\" and then suddenly meet her clear blue eyes and feel as if you had stepped on the teeth of a rake and had the handle jump up and hit you in the face?","Stimulated by the juice, I believe, men have even been known to ride alligators.","What George was thinking was that the late king Herod had been unjustly blamed for a policy which had been both statesmanlike and in the interests of the public. He was blaming the mawkish sentimentality of the modern legal system which ranks the evisceration and secret burial of small boys as a crime.","There\'s something about evening service in a country church that makes a fellow feel drowsy and peaceful. Sort of end-of-a-perfect-day feeling. Old Heppenstall was up in the pulpit, and he has a kind of regular, bleating delivery that assists thought. They had left the door open, and the air was full of a mixed scent of trees and honeysuckle and mildew and villagers\' Sunday clothes. As far as the eye could reach, you could see farmers propped up in restful attitudes, breathing heavily; and the children in the congregation who had fidgeted during the earlier part of the proceedings were now lying back in a surfeited sort of coma. The last rays of the setting sun shone through the stained-glass windows, birds were twittering in the trees, the women\'s dresses crackled gently in the stillness. Peaceful. That\'s what I\'m driving at. I felt peaceful. Everybody felt peaceful.","the march of civilisation has given the modern girl a vocabulary and an ability to use it which her grandmother never had","It can\'t be done, old thing.

Even as a boy, hardly capable of connected thought, he had been convinced that his speciality, the one thing he could do really well, was to inherit money.","We Woosters can bite the bullet.","Would you say my head was like a pumpkin, Wooster?\u2019 \u2018Not a bit, old man.\u2019 \u2018Not like a pumpkin?\u2019 \u2018No, not like a pumpkin. A touch of the dome of St Paul\u2019s, perhaps.","Unlike the male codfish, which, suddenly finding itself the parent of three million five hundred thousand little codfish, cheerfully resolves to love them all, the British aristocracy is apt to look with a somewhat jaundiced eye on its younger sons. And Freddie Threepwood was one of those younger sons who rather invite the jaundiced eye.","A dog without influence or private means, if he is to make his way in the world, must have either good looks or amiability.","The drowsy stillness of the summer afternoon was shattered by what sounded to his strained senses like G.K. Chesterton falling on a sheet of tin.","She had turned away and was watching a duck out on the lake. It was tucking into weeds, a thing I\'ve never been able to understand anyone wanting to do.

People were asking themselves by what right these aliens had overrun British soil. An ever-growing feeling of annoyance had begun to lay hold of the nation.","You must meet old Rowbotham, Bertie. A delightful chap. Wants to massacre the bourgeoisie, sack Park Lane and disembowel the hereditary aristocracy. Well, nothing could be fairer than that, what?","Little as he knew of women, he was aware that as a sex they are apt to be startled by the sight of men crawling out from under the seats of compartments.","Do you mind not intoning the responses, Jeeves?\\" I said. \\"This is a most complicated story for a man with a headache to have to tell, and if you interrupt you\'ll make me lose the thread. As a favour to me, therefore, don\'t do it.

Don\'t tell me you know her!\\"\\"Not personally, sir. But I have a cousin residing in the village who has some slight acquaintance with Miss Sipperley.

Yes, Jeeves, you should have nodded. But it\'s too late now.","I laughed derisively.\\"For goodness\' sake, don\'t start gargling now. This is serious.\\"\\"I was laughing.\\"\\"Oh, were you? Well, I\'m glad to see you taking it in this merry spirit.\\"\\"Derisively,\\" I explained.","More and more, it was beginning to be borne in upon me what a particularly difficult chap Gussie was to help. He seemed to so marked an extent to lack snap and finish. With infinite toil, you manoeuvred him into a position where all he had to do was charge ahead, and he didn\'t charge ahead, but went off sideways, missing the objective completely.","All nice girls sketch a little.","Don\'t blame me, Pongo,\' said Lord Ickenham, \'if Lady Constance takes her lorgnette to you. God bless my soul, though, you can\'t compare the lorgnettes of to-day with the ones I used to know as a boy. I remember walking one day in Grosvenor Square with my aunt Brenda and her pug dog Jabberwocky, and a policeman came up and said the latter ought to be wearing a muzzle. My aunt made no verbal reply. She merely whipped her lorgnette from its holster and looked at the man, who gave one choking gasp and fell back against the railings, without a mark on him but with an awful look of horror in his staring eyes, as if he had seen some dreadful sight. A doctor was sent for, and they managed to bring him round, but he was never the same again. He had to leave the Force, and eventually drifted into the grocery business. And that is how Sir Thomas Lipton got his start.","Mike\u2019s statement that he wanted to get up early and have a ride had been received by Psmith, with whom early rising was not a hobby, with honest amazement and a flood of advice and warning on the subject.\u201cOne of the Georges, said Psmith, \u201cI forget which, once said that a certain number of hours\u2019 sleep a day\u2014I cannot recall for the moment how many\u2014made a man something, which for the time being has slipped my memory.

Still, if you\u2019re bent on it\u2026.\u201d","Trouble, after all, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder","Once more he became silent, staring before him with sombre eyes. Following his gaze, I saw that he was looking at an enlarged photograph of my Uncle Tom in some sort of Masonic uniform which stood on the mantlepiece. I\'ve tried to reason with Aunt Dahlia about this photograph for years, placing before her two alternative suggestions: (a) To burn the beastly thing; or (b) if she must preserve it, to shove me in another room when I come to stay. But she declines to accede. She says it\'s good for me. A useful discipline, she maintains, teaching me that there is a darker side to life and that we were not put into this world for pleasure only.","Nothing to be done about it except give her a reproachful look. I did this. It made no impression whatever, and she proceeded.","She uttered a sound rather like an elephant taking its foot out of a mud hole in a Burmese teak forest.","One uses the verb \u2018descend\u2019 advisedly, for what is required is some word suggesting instantaneous activity.

He was a good-natured and cheerful young man, who liked life and the great majority of those who lived it contemporaneously with himself. He had no enemies and many friends.But today he had noticed from the moment he had got out of bed that something was amiss with the world. Either he was in the grip of some divine discontent due to the highly developed condition of his soul, or else he had a grouch. One of the two.","Jeeves,\\" I said, \\"those spats.\\"\\"Yes, sir?\\"\\"You really dislike them?\\"\\"Intensely, sir.\\"\\"You don\'t think time might induce you to change your views?\\"\\"No, sir.\\"\\"All right, then.

You don\'t mind me alluding to you as a gazelle, Jeeves?\'\'Not at all, sir.","Hypatia, like all girls who intend to be good wives, made it a practice to look on any suggestions thrown out by her future lord and master as fatuous and futile.","Yes, by damn! It\'s too bad!\\" cried the whiskered marvel. \\"You careless old woman! You give my hotel bad names, would you or wasn\'t it? Tomorrow you leave my hotel, by great Scotland!\\"... I turned to Aunt Agatha, whose demeanour was now rather like that of one who, picking daisies on the railway, has just caught the down express in the small of the back.","But, Ed! Say! Are you going to let him get away with it?\\"\\"Am I going to let him get away with it!\\" said Mr. Cootes, annoyed by the foolish question. \\"Wake me up in the night and ask me!\\" \\"But what are you going to do?\\"\\"Do!\\" said Mr. Cootes. \\"Do! I\'ll tell you what I\'m going to...\\" He paused, and the stern resolve that shone in his face seemed to flicker. \\"Say, what the hell am I going do?\\" he went on somewhat weakly.","Have you lost the girl you love?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out.

It all depends what construction you place on the words \u201cI never want to see or speak to you again in this world or the next, you miserable fathead.\u2019 \u2018Did she say that?\u201d","I don\'t know why it is, but I\'ve never been able to bear with fortitude anything in the shape of a kid with golden curls. Confronted with one, I feel the urge to step on him or drop things on him from a height.","At a time when she was engaged to Stilton Cheesewright, I remember recording in the archives that she was tall and willowy with a terrific profile and luxuriant platinum blond-hair, the sort of girl who might, as far as looks were concerned, have been the star unit of the harem of one of the better-class sultans.","I started m-p-h-ing it homewards in a thrice","Well, if he comes when I\'m out, tell him to wait.

It is, of course, extremely painful to see a man in such a condition, but when such a person in endeavouring to count a perpetually moving drove of pigs, the onlooker\'s pain is sensibly diminished.","Yes, sir,\' said Jeeves in a low, cold voice, as if he had been bitten in the leg by a personal friend.","As an energetic Socialist, I do my best to see the good that is in him, but it\'s hard. Comrade Bristow\'s the most striking argument against the equality of man I\'ve ever come across.","I mean to say, I know perfectly well that I\'ve got, roughly speaking, half the amount of brain a normal bloke ought to possess. And when a girl comes along who has about twice the regular allowance, she too often makes a bee line for me with the love light in her eyes. I don\'t know how to account for it, but it is so.\\"\\"It may be Nature\'s provision for maintaining the balance of the species, sir.\\"...\\"At breakfast this morning, when I was eating a sausage, she told me I shouldn\'t, as modern medical science held that a four-inch sausage contained as many germs as a dead rat.

I haven\'t the machinery.\\"\\"I will most certainly devote my very best attention to the matter, sir, and will endeavour to give satisfaction.\\"Well, that was something. But I was ill at east. Yes, there is no getting away from it, Bertram was ill at ease.","There\'s no getting away from the fact that, if ever a man required watching, it\'s Steggles. Machiavelli could have taken his correspondence course.","Had his brain been constructed of silk, he would have been hard put to it to find sufficient material to make a canary a pair of cami-knickers.","It seems to me that you and I were made for each other. I am your best friend\u2019s best friend and we both have a taste for stealing other people\u2019s jewellery.","I give you my word that, until I started to tramp the place with this child, I never had a notion that it was such a difficult job restoring a son to his parents. How kidnappers ever get caught is a mystery to me. I searched Marvis Bay like a bloodhound, but nobody came forward to claim the infant. You would have thought, from the lack of interest in him, that he was stopping there all by himself in a cottage of his own.","Good works?\\"\\"About the village, sir. Reading to the bedridden - chatting with the sick - that sort of thing, sir. We can but trust that good results will ensue.\\"\\"Yes, I suppose so,\\" I said doubtfully. \\"But, by gosh, if I were a sick man I\'d hate to have a looney like young Bingo coming and gibbering at my bedside.","Reflect, old man! We have been pals for years. Your mother likes me.\\"\\"No, she doesn\'t.\\"\\"Well, anyway, we were at school together and you owe me a tenner.\\"\\"Oh, well,\\" he said in a resigned sort of voice.","Mother always used to say, \'If you want to succeed in life, please the women. They are the real bosses. The men don\'t count.","I spent the afternoon musing on Life. If you come to think of it, what a queer thing Life is! So unlike anything else, don\'t you know, if you see what I mean. At any moment you may be strolling peacefully along, and all the time Life\'s waiting around the corner to fetch you one. You can\'t tell when you may be going to get it. It\'s all dashed puzzling. Here was poor old George, as well-meaning a fellow as every stepped, getting swatted all over the ring by the hand of Fate. Why? That\'s what I asked myself. Just Life, don\'t you know. That\'s all there was about it.","He was stoutly opposed to the idea of marrying anyone; but if, as happens to the best of us, he ever were compelled to perform the wedding glide, he had always hoped it would be with some lady golf champion who would help him with his putting, and thus, by bringing his handicap down a notch or two, enable him to save something from the wreck, so to speak.","He\'s such a dear, Mr. Garnet. A beautiful, pure, bred Persian. He has taken prizes.\\"\\"He\'s always taking something - generally food.","I had one of those ideas I do sometimes get, though admittedly a chump of the premier class.","Are there any books of that sort nowadays?

The tongue had got all tangled up with the uvula, and the brain seemed paralyzed. I was feeling the same stunned feeling which, I imagine, Chichester Clam must have felt as the door of the potting shed slammed and he heard Boko starting to yodel without -- a nightmare sensation of being but a helpless pawn in the hands of Fate.","I don\u2019t mind people talking rot in my presence, but it must not be utter rot.","I must say my heart leaped up, as Jeeves tells me his does when he beholds a rainbow in the sky.","After all, golf is only a game,\'\' said Millicent. Women say these things without thinking. It does not mean that there is any kink in their character. They simply don\'t realise what they\'re saying.","The coops were finished. They were not masterpieces, and I have seen chickens pause before them in deep thought, as who should say: \\"Now what in the world have we struck here?\\" But they were coops, within the meaning of the act, and we induced the hens to become tenants.","That is all, Augustus,\' she said, and dismissed me with a gesture of loathing, as if I had been a green-fly that had fallen short of even the very moderate level of decency of the average run-of-the-mill green fly.","Aunt Agatha is my tough aunt, the one who eats broken bottles and conducts human sacrifices by the light of the full moon.","As life goes on, don\'t you find that all you need is about two real friends, a regular supply of books, and a Peke?","Don\'t forget that in pushing policemen into duck ponds the follow through is everything.","As a rule, from what I\'ve observed, the American captain of industry doesn\'t do anything out of business hours. When he has put the cat out and locked up the office for the night, he just relapses into a state of coma from which he emerges only to start being a captain of industry again.","No wonder Freddie experienced the sort of abysmal soul-sadness which afflicts one of Tolstoi\'s Russian peasants when, after putting in a heavy day\'s work strangling his father, beating his wife, and dropping the baby into the city reservoir, he turns to the cupboard, only to find the vodka bottle empty.","This woman always made Freddie feel as if he were being disemboweled by some clumsy amateur.","He was the sort of man who would have tried to cheer Napoleon up by talking about the Winter Sports at Moscow.","How did it all end?\'\'Oh, I got away with my life. Still, what\'s life?\'\'Life\'s all right.","I am Psmith. I sub-edit.","Lord Chesterfield said that since he had had the full use of his reason nobody had heard him laugh. I don\'t suppose you have read Lord Chesterfield\'s \'Letters To His Son\'?...Well, of course I hadn\'t. Bertram Wooster does not read other people\'s letters. If I were employed in the post office I wouldn\'t even read the postcards.","Tell me,\\" said Ashe gratefully, leaning forward in an attitude of attention, \\"all about the lining of your stomach.","He had the look of a frustrated tiger whose personal physician had recommended a strict vegetarian diet.","If you are a millionaire beset by blackmailers or anyone else to whose comfort the best legal advice is essential, and have decided to put your affairs in the hands of the ablest and discreetest firm in London, you proceed through a dark and grimy entry and up a dark and grimy flight of stairs; and, having felt your way along a dark and grimy passage, you come at length to a dark and grimy door. There is plenty of dirt in other parts of Ridgeway\'s Inn, but nowhere is it so plentiful, so rich in alluvial deposits, as on the exterior of the offices of Marlowe, Thorpe, Prescott, Winslow and Appleby. As you tap on the topmost of the geological strata concealing the ground-glass of the door, a sense of relief and security floods your being. For in London grubbiness is the gauge of a lawyer\'s respectability.","It was the look which Ajax had in his eyes when he defied the lightning, the look which nervous husbands have when they announce their intention of going round the corner to bowl a few games with the boys. One could not say definitely that Lord Marshmoreton looked pop-eyed. On the other hand, one could not assert truthfully that he did not.","If this is Upper Silesia, what on earth must Lower Silesia be like?","I mean to say, millions of people, no doubt, are so constituted that they scream with joy and excitement at the spectacle of a stuffed porcupine-fish or a glass jar of seeds from Western Australia - but not Bertram. No; if you will take the word of one who would not deceive you, not Bertram. By the time we had tottered out of the Gold Coast village and were working towards the Palace of Machinery, everything pointed to my shortly executing a quiet sneak in the direction of that rather jolly Planters\' Bar in the West Indian section. ...There are certain moments in life when words are not needed. I looked at Biffy, Biffy looked at me. A perfect understanding linked our two souls.\\"?\\"\\"!\\"Three minutes later we had joined the Planters.I have never been in the West Indies, but I am in a position to state that in certain of the fundamentals of life they are streets ahead of our European civilisation. The man behind the counter, as kindly a bloke as I ever wish to meet, seemed to guess our requirements the moment we hove in view. Scarcely had our elbows touched the wood before he was leaping to and fro, bringing down a new bottle with each leap. A planter, apparently, does not consider he has had a drink unless it contains at least seven ingredients, and I\'m not saying, mind you, that he isn\'t right. The man behind the bar told us the things were called Green Swizzles; and, if ever I marry and have a son, Green Swizzle Wooster is the name that will go down on the register, in memory of the day his father\'s life was saved at Wembley.","Have you ever seen a man, woman, or child who wasn\u2019t eating an egg or just going to eat an egg or just coming away from eating an egg? I tell you, the good old egg is the foundation of daily life. Stop the first man you meet in the street and ask him which he\u2019d sooner lose, his egg or his wife, and see what he says!","Bertie old man I say Bertie could you possibly come down here at once. Everything gone wrong hang it all. Dash it Bertie you simply must come. I am in a state of absolute despair and heart-broken. Would you mind sending another hundred of those cigarettes. Bring Jeeves when you come Bertie. You simply must come Bertie. I rely on you. Don\'t forget to bring Jeeves. Bingo.For a chap who\'s perpetually hard-up, I must say that young Bingo is the most wasteful telegraphist I ever struck. He\'s got no notion of condensing. The silly ass simply pours out his wounded soul at twopence a word, or whatever it is, without a thought.","What you want,\\" I said, \\"is to look out for a chance and save her from drowning.\\"\\"I can\'t swim.\\"That was Freddie Bullivant all over.

One has heard of it, of course, but has its existence ever been proved? I think not.","Man\'s inability to get out of bed in the morning is a curious thing. One may reason with oneself clearly and forcibly without the slightest effect. One knows that delay means inconvenience. Perhaps it may spoil one\'s whole day. And one also knows that a single resolute heave will do the trick. But logic is of no use. One simply lies there.","Vladimir specialized in grey studies of hopeless misery, where nothing happened till page 380, when the muzhik decided to commit suicide.","It is the opinion of most thoughtful students of life that happiness in this world depends chiefly on the ability to take things as they come. An instance of one who may be said to have perfected this attitude is to be found in the writings of a certain eminent Arabian author who tells of a traveller who, sinking to sleep one afternoon upon a patch of turf containing an acorn, discovered when he woke that the warmth of his body had caused the acorn to germinate and that he was now some sixty feet above the ground in the upper branches of a massive oak. Unable to descend, he faced the situation equably. \u2018I cannot,\u2019 he observed, \u2018adapt circumstances to my will: therefore I shall adapt my will to circumstances. I decide to remain here.\u2019 Which he did.","I was conscious of a passing pang for the oyster world, feeling--and I think correctly--that life for these unfortunate bivalves must be one damn thing after another.","Jeeves,\\" I said, when I had washed off the stains of travel, \\"tell me frankly all about it. Be as frank as Lady Bablockhythe.","I must explain Henry early, to avoid disappointment.","When Nature makes a chump like dear old Bobbie, she\'s proud of him, and doesn\'t want her handiwork disturbed. She gives him a sort of natural armour to protect him against outside interference. And that armour is shortness of memory. Shortness of memory keeps a man a chump, when, but for it, he might cease to be one.","Mere surprise, however, was never enough to prevent Psmith talking.","For a time the broken heart, and then suddenly the healing conviction that one is jolly well out of it.","Never mind,\\" I said crisply. \\"I have my methods.\\" I dug out my entire stock of manly courage, breathed a short prayer and let her have it right in the thorax.","I went into the kitchen ten minutes back.

A pretty nasty shock for the chap, of course, but the point I\'m working round to is that there were a couple of lines that went, if I remember correctly: She starts. She moves. She seems to feel The stir of life along her keel. And what I\'m driving at is that you couldn\'t get a better description of what happened to Gussie as I spoke these heartening words. His brow cleared, his eyes brightened, he lost that fishy look, and he gazed at the slug, which was still on the long, long trail with something approaching bonhomie. A marked improvement.","I\'m bound to say I was not feeling entirely at my ease. There is something about the man that is calculated to strike terror into the stoutest heart. If ever there was a bloke at the very mention of whose name it would be excusable for people to tremble like aspens, that bloke is Sir Roderick Glossop.

Many\'s the time, back in London, I\'ve hurried along Piccadilly and felt the hot breath of the toucher on the back of my neck and heard his sharp excited yapping as he closed in on me.

He showed me the vanity and wickedness of sitting in gilded haunts of vice, eating lobster when decent people should be in bed.\'He said that the tango and the fox-trot were devices of the devil to drag people down into the Bottomless Pit.

Then there hove in sight a small boy, and he shook like a jelly. Finally, like a star whose entrance has been worked up by the personnel of the ensemble, a girl appeared, and his emotion was painful to witness. His face got so red that, what with his white collar and the fact that the wind had turned his nose blue, he looked more like a French flag than anything else. He sagged from the waist upwards, as if he had been filleted. He was just raising his fingers limply to his cap when he suddenly saw that the girl wasn\'t alone. A chappie in clerical costume was also among those present, and the sight of him didn\'t seem to do Bingo a bit of good. His face got redder and his nose bluer, and it wasn\'t till they had nearly passed that he managed to get hold of his cap.The girl bowed, the curate said, \\"Ah, Little. Rough weather,\\" the dog barked, and then they toddled on and the entertainment was over.","Sippy had described them as England\'s premier warts, and it looked to me as if he might be about right. Professor Pringle was a thinnish, baldish, dyspeptic-lookingish cove with an eye like a haddock, while Mrs Pringle\'s aspect was that of one who had had bad news round about the year 1900 and never really got over it.

The whole strength of the company gazed at me like a family group out of one of Edgar Allan Poe\'s less cheery yarns, and I felt my joie de vivre dying at the roots.\\"I remember Oliver,\\" said Exhibit A. She heaved a sigh. \\"He was such a pretty child. What a pity! What a pity!\\"Tactful, of course, and calculated to put the guest completely at his ease.","I had staked all on Gussie making a favourable impression on his hostess, basing my confidence on the fact that he was one of those timid, obsequious, teacup-passing, thin-bread- and-butter-offering, yes-men whom women of my Aunt Dahlia\'s type nearly always like at first sight.","a chap who\'s supposed to stop chaps pinching things from chaps having a chap come along and pinch something from him.","Judge of my chagrin and all that sort of thing, therefore, when, tottering to my room and switching on the light, I observed the foul features of young Bingo all over the pillow.","I suppose everyone has had that ghastly feeling at one time or another of being urged by some overwhelming force to do some absolutely blithering act.","This Miss Wooster that I knew married a man named Spenser.

At the thought of what horrors might ensue after the clergyman had done his stuff and she had a legal right to bring my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave, the imagination boggled. It was a subdued and apprehensive Bertram Wooster who some moments later reached for the hat and light overcoat and went off to the Savoy to shove food into the Trotters.","It was some time before this happened, for he had got a very fine hand indeed.

I simply can\'t describe her.\\"This was all to the good.","There you see two typical members of the class which has down-trodden the poor for centuries. Idlers! Non-producers! Look at the tall thin one with the face like a motor-mascot. Has he ever done an honest day\'s work in his life? No! A prowler, a trifler, and a blood-sucker! And I bet he still owes his tailor for those trousers!\\"He seemed to me to be verging on the personal, and I didn\'t think a lot of it. Old Bittlesham, on the other hand, was pleased and amused.\\"A great gift of expression these fellows have,\\" he chuckled. \\"Very trenchant.\\"\\"And the fat one!\\" proceeded the chappie. \\"Don\'t miss him. Do you know who that is? That\'s Lord Bittlesham! One of the worst. What has he ever done except eat four square meals a day? His god is his belly, and he sacrifices burnt-offerings to it. If you opened that man now you would find enough lunch to support ten working-class families for a week.\\"\\"You know, that\'s rather well put,\\" I said, but the old boy didn\'t seem to see it. He had turned a brightish magenta and was bubbling like a kettle on the boil.\\"Come away, Mr Wooster,\\" he said. \\"I am the last man to oppose the right of free speech, but I refuse to listen to this vulgar abuse any longer.\\"We legged it with quiet dignity, the chappie pursuing us with his foul innuendoes to the last. Dashed embarrassing.","I\'ve often wondered why Nature, widely publicized being infinite in its wisdom, should have made the grave mistake of creating redheads, always so impulsive and quick on the trigger.","I have always had a suspicion that Aunt Dahlia, while invariably matey and bonhomous and seeming to take pleasure in my society, has a lower opinion of my intelligence than I quite like. Too often it is her practice to address me as \u2018fathead\u2019, and if I put forward any little thought or idea or fancy in her hearing it is apt to be greeted with the affectionate but jarring guffaw.","I will be your wife, Bertie.\u2019 There didn\u2019t seem much to say to this except \u2018Oh, thanks.","I was back at the flat so quick that I nearly met myself coming out.","Once in every few publishing seasons there is an Event. For no apparent reason, the great heart of the Public gives a startled jump, and the public\'s great purse is emptied to secure copies of some novel which has stolen into the world without advance advertising and whose only claim to recognition is that The Licensed Victuallers\' Gazette has stated in a two-line review that it is \'readable\'.","I was exercised about the poor fish, as I am about all my pals, close or distant, who find themselves treading upon Life\'s banana skins.","There is nothing that so satisfactorily unites individuals who have been so unfortunate as to quarrel amongst themselves as a strong mutual dislike for some definite person.","It\u2019s called \u201cCaliban At Sunset.\u2019 \u2018What at sunset?\u2019 \u2018Caliban.\u2019 He cleared his throat, and began: I stood with a man Watching the sun go down. The air was full of murmurous summer scents And a brave breeze sang like a bugle From a sky that smouldered in the west, A sky of crimson, amethyst and gold and sepia And blue as blue as were the eyes of Helen When she sat Gazing from some high tower in Ilium Upon the Grecian tents darkling below. And he, This man who stood beside me, Gaped like some dull, half-witted animal And said, \u2018I say, Doesn\u2019t that sunset remind you Of a slice Of underdone roast beef?\u2019 He\u201d","You never know what is waiting for you around the corner.

But only for a moment. There has always been something of the good old English bulldog breed about Bingo. A strange, sweet smile flickered for an instant over his face.\\"It\'s all right,\\" he said. \\"I can sneak out through the cellar and climb over the wall at the back. They can\'t intimidate me!","I hardly knew what to do. I wanted, of course, to rush down to Washington Square and grip the poor blighter silently by the hand; and then, thinking it over, I hadn\'t the nerve. Absent treatment seemed the touch. I gave it him in waves.","How long Archibald slept he could not have said. He woke some hours later with a vague feeling that a thunderstorm of unusual violence had broken out in his immediate neighborhood. But this, he realized as the mists of slumber cleared away, was an error. The noise which had disturbed him was not thunder but the sound of someone snoring. Snoring like the dickens. The walls seemed to be vibrating like the deck of an ocean liner....His spirit was not so completely broken as to make him lie supinely down beneath that snoring. The sound filled him, as snoring fills every right-thinking man, with a seething resentment and a passionate yearning for justice, and he climbed out of bed with the intention of taking the proper steps through the recognized channels. It is the custom nowadays to disparage the educational methods of the English public school and to maintain that they are not practical and of a kind to fit the growing boy for the problems of afterlife. But you do learn one thing at a public school, and that is how to act when somebody starts snoring.You jolly well grab a cake of soap and pop in and stuff it down the blighter\'s throat. And this is what Archibald proposed - God willing - to do.","The sun, taken in as usual by the never-failing practical joke of the Daylight Saving Act, had only just set, and a golden afterglow lingered on the fields as the car which had met the train purred over the two miles of country road that separated the little town from the castle.","Why has the car stopped?\\"\\"Ah!\\" I said with manly frankness that became me well. \\"There you have me.\\"You see, I\'m one of those birds who drive a lot but don\'t know the first thing about the works. The policy I pursue is to get aboard, prod the self-starter, and leave the rest to Nature. If anything goes wrong, I scream for an A.A. scout. It\'s a system that answers admirably as a rule, but on the present occasion it blew a fuse owing to the fact that there wasn\'t an A.A. scout within miles.","Much has been written on the subject of bed-books. The general consensus of opinion is that a gentle, slow-moving story makes the best opiate","I\'ve been through a bad time, Bertie, these last weeks. The sun ceased to shine - \\"\\"That\'s curious. We\'ve had gorgeous weather in London.\\"\\"The birds ceased to sing.\\"\\"What birds?\\"\\"What the devil does it matter what birds?\\" said young BIngo, with some asperity. \\"Any birds. The birds round about here. You don\'t expect me to specify them by their pet names, do you?

Nice girl, of course.\\"He eyed me with deep loathing.\\"Don\'t speak of her in that horrible casual way. She\'s an angel. An angel!","moment blighted Harold discovered that training meant knocking off pastry, taking exercise, and keeping away from the cigarettes, he was all against it, and it was only by unceasing vigilance that we managed to keep him in any shape at all.","It suddenly struck me so forcibly, one morning while I was having my bath, that I hadn\'t a worry on earth that I began to sing like a bally nightingale as I sploshed the sponge about. It seemed to me that everything was absolutely for the best in the best of all possible worlds.","Writing my books I enjoy. It is the thinking them out that is apt to blot the sunshine from my life.","So!\' he said, at length, and it came as a complete surprise to me that fellows ever really do say \'So!\'. I had always thought it was just a thing you read in books.","Don\u2019t you ever read the papers? Roderick Spode is the founder and head of the Saviours of Britain, a Fascist organization better known as the Black Shorts. His general idea, if he doesn\u2019t get knocked on the head with a bottle in one of the frequent brawls in which he and his followers indulge, is to make himself a Dictator.\u2019 \u2018Well, I\u2019m blowed!\u2019 I was astounded at my keenness of perception. The moment I had set eyes on Spode, if you remember, I had said to myself \u2018What ho! A Dictator!\u2019 and a Dictator he had proved to be. I couldn\u2019t have made a better shot, if I had been one of those detectives who see a chap walking along the street and deduce that he is a retired manufacturer of poppet valves named Robinson with rheumatism in one arm, living at Clapham. \u2018Well, I\u2019m dashed! I thought he was something of that sort. That chin\u2026Those eyes\u2026And, for the matter of that, that moustache. By the way, when you say \u201cshorts, you mean \u201cshirts\u201d, of course.\u2019 \u2018No. By the time Spode formed his association, there were no shirts left. He and his adherents wear black shorts.\u2019 \u2018Footer bags, you mean?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018How perfectly foul.\u201d","Sir Roderick Glossop, Honoria\u2019s father, is always called a nerve specialist, because it sounds better, but everybody knows that he\u2019s a sort of janitor to the looney-bin. I mean to say, when your uncle the Duke begins to feel the strain a bit and you find him in the blue drawing room sticking straws in his hair, old Glossop is the first person you send for. ... Practically every posh family in the country has called him in at one time or another, and I suppose that, being in that position\u2014I mean, constantly having to sit on people\u2019s heads while their nearest and dearest phone to the asylum to send round the waggon\u2014does tend to make a chappie take what you call a warped view of humanity.","If girls realized their responsibilities they would be so careful when they smiled that they would probably abandon the practice altogether. There are moments in a man\'s life when a girl\'s smile can have as important results as an explosion of dynamite.","Tell me, Jeeves,\\" I said. \\"Suppose you were in a shop taking By The Order of the Czar out of the lending library and a clergyman\'s daughter came in and without so much as a preliminary \'Hullo, there\' said to you, \'Has he brought it yet?\' what interpretations would you place on those words?\\"He pondered, this way and that dividing the swift mind, as I have heard him put it.\\"\'Has he brought it yet,\' sir?\\"\\"Just that.\\"\\"I should reach the conclusion that the lady was expecting a male acquaintance to have arrived or to be arriving shortly bearing some unidentified object.","Bertie,\u2019 he said, \u2018I want your advice.\u2019 \u2018Carry on.\u2019 \u2018At least, not your advice, because that wouldn\u2019t be much good to anybody. I mean, you\u2019re a pretty consummate old ass, aren\u2019t you? Not that I want to hurt your feelings, of course.","Presently, I was aware that Jeeves was with me. I hadn\'t heard him come in, but you often don\'t with Jeeves. He just streams silently from spot A to spot B, like some gas.","In these disturbed days in which we live, it has probably occurred to all thinking men that something drastic ought to be done about aunts. Speaking for myself, I have long felt that stones should be turned and avenues explored with a view to putting a stopper on the relatives in question. If someone were to come to me and say, \'Wooster, would you be interested in joining a society I am starting whose aim will be the suppression of aunts or at least will see to it that they are kept on a short chain and are not permitted to roam hither and thither at will, scattering desolation on all side?\', I would reply, \'Wilbraham\', if his name was Wilbraham, \'I am with you heart and soul.

Yet it appeared plain that his loss had left a large gap in this girl\'s life.","Let us say, then, that at some point\u2014five, ten, fifteen, or it may have been twenty minutes later\u2014I became aware of somebody coughing softly at my side like a respectful sheep trying to attract the attention of its shepherd, and with how can I describe what thankfulness and astonishment I perceived Jeeves.","London was too big to be angry with. It took no notice of him. It did not care whether he was glad to be there or sorry, and there was no means of making it care. That is the peculiarity of London. There is a sort of cold unfriendliness about it. A city like New York makes the new arrival feel at home in half an hour; but London is a specialist in what Psmith in his letter had called the Distant Stare. You have to buy London\u2019s good-will.","He was a red-headed chap, and my experience of the red-headed is that you can always expect high blood pressure from them in times of stress. The first Queen Elizabeth had red hair, and look what she did to Mary Queen of Scots.","At that moment the gong sounded, and the genial host came tumbling downstairs like the delivery of a ton of coals.","Come to the bit about soft silk shirts for evening wear?\\" I asked carelessly.\\"Yes, sir,\\" said Jeeves, in a low, cold voice, as if he had been bitten in the leg by a personal friend. \\"And if I may be pardoned for saying so - \\"\\"You don\'t like it?\\"\\"No, sir. I do not. Soft silk shirts with evening costume are not worn, sir.\\"\\"Jeeves,\\" I said, looking the blighter diametrically in the centre of the eyeball, \\"they\'re dashed well going to be. I may as well tell you now that I have ordered a dozen of those shirtings from Peabody and Simms, and it\'s no good looking like that, because I am jolly well adamant.\\"\\"If I might - \\"\\"No, Jeeves,\\" I said, raising my hand, \\"argument is useless. Nobody has a greater respect than I have for your judgment in socks, in ties, and - I will go farther - in spats; but when it comes to evening shirts your nerve seems to fail you. You have no vision. You are prejudiced and reactionary. Hidebound is the word that suggests itself. It may interest you to learn that when I was at Le Touquet the Prince of Wales buzzed into the Casino one night with soft silk shirt complete.\\"\\"His Royal Highness, sir, may permit himself a certain licence which in your own case - \\"\\"No, Jeeves,\\" I said, firmly, \\"it\'s no use. When we Woosters are adamant, we are - well, adamant, if you know what I mean.\\"\\"Very good, sir.\\"I could see the man was wounded, and, of course, the whole episode had been extremely jarring and unpleasant; but these things have to be gone through. Is one a serf or isn\'t one? That\'s what it all boils down to.","It was a silver cow. But when I say \u2018cow\u2019, don\u2019t go running away with the idea of some decent, self-respecting cudster such as you may observe loading grass into itself in the nearest meadow. This was a sinister, leering, Underworld sort of animal, the kind that would spit out of the side of its mouth for twopence. It was about four inches high and six long. Its back opened on a hinge. Its tail was arched, so that the tip touched the spine\u2014thus, I suppose, affording a handle for the cream-lover to grasp. The sight of it seemed to take me into a different and dreadful world.","It was as good a dinner as I have ever absorbed, and Thomas like a watered flower. As we sat down he was saying some things about the Government which they wouldn\'t have cared to hear. With the consomme pate d\'Italie he said but what could you expect nowadays? With the paupiettes de sole a la princesse he admitted rather decently that the Government couldn\'t be held responsible for the rotten weather, anyway. And shortly after the caneton Aylesbury a la broche he was practically giving the lads the benefit of his whole-hearted support.","He looked at me like Lillian Gish coming out of a swoon.\\"Is this Bertie Wooster talking?\\" he said, pained.\\"Yes, it jolly well is!\\"\\"Bertie, old man,\\" said Bingo, patting me gently here and there, \\"reflect! We were at school - \\"\\"Oh, all right!","I am pitching it feebly,\\" said young Bingo earnestly. \\"You haven\'t heard the thing. I have. Rosie shoved the cylinder on the dictating-machine last night before dinner, and it was grisly to hear the instrument croaking out those awful sentences. If that article appears I shall be kidded to death by every pal I\'ve got. Bertie,\\" he said, his voice sinking to a hoarse whisper, \\"you have about as much imagination as a warthog, but surely even you can picture to yourself what Jimmy Bowles and Tuppy Rogers, to name only tow, will say when they see me referred to in print as \\"half god, half prattling, mischievous child\\"?\\"I jolly well could\\"She doesn\'t say that?\\"I gasped.\\"She certainly does. And when I tell you that I selected that particular quotation because it\'s about the only one I can stand hearing spoken, you will realise what I\'m up against.","But a thing I\u2019ve often noticed is that when I\u2019ve got something off my mind, it pretty nearly always happens that Fate sidles up and shoves on something else,","The snail was on the wing and the lark on the thorn - or, rather, the other way around - and God was in His heaven and all right with the world. And presently the eyes closed, the muscles relaxed, the breathing became soft and regular, and sleep, which does something which has slipped my mind to the something sleeve of care, poured over me in a healing wave.","Lord Emsworth could conceive of no way in which Freddie could be of value to a dog-biscuit firm, except possibly as a taster.","I could still see that Pauline was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever met, but of the ancient fire which had caused me to bung my heart at her feet that night at the Plaza there remained not a trace. Analysing this, if analyzing is the word I want, I came to the conclusion that this changed outlook was due to the fact that she was so dashed dynamic. Unquestionably an eyeful, Pauline Stoker had the grave defect of being one of those girls who want you to come and swim a mile before breakfast and rout you out when you are trying to snatch a wink of sleep after lunch for a merry five sets of tennis.","But I say, really, you know, I am an old friend of the family. Why, by Jove, now I remember, there\'s a photograph of me in the drawing-room. Well, I mean, that shows you!\\"\\"If there is,\\" said the policeman.\\"I\'ve never seen it,\\" said the parlourmaid.I absolutely hated this girl.\\"You would have seen it if you had done your dusting more conscientiously,\\" I said severely. And I meant it to sting, by Jove!\\"It is not a parlourmaid\'s place to dust the drawing-room,\\" she sniffed haughtily.\\"No,\\" I said bitterly. \\"It seems to be a parlourmaid\'s place to lurk about and hang about and - er - waste her time fooling about in the garden with policemen who ought to be busy about their duties elsewhere.\\"\\"It\'s a parlourmaid\'s place to open the front door to visitors. Them that don\'t come in through windows.\\"I perceived that I was getting the loser\'s end of the thing.","Oh, Jeeves,\\" I said, \\"did Peabody and Simms send those soft silk shirts?\\"\\"Yes, sir. I sent them back.\\"\\"Sent them back!\\"\\"Yes, sir.\\"I eyed him for a moment. But I mean to say. I mean, what\'s the use?\\"Oh, all right,\\" I said. \\"Then lay out one of the gents\' stiff-bosomed.\\"\\"Very good, sir,\\" said Jeeves.","Bertie, it is imperative that you marry.\\"\\"But, dash it all...\\"\\"Yes! You should be breeding children to...\\"\\"No, really, I say, please!\\" I said, blushing richly. Aunt Agatha belongs to two or three of these women\'s clubs, and she keeps forgetting she isn\'t in the smoking-room.","Every time I look up and catch that kid\'s vacant eye, I suffer agonies. I tell you, Bertie, sometimes when he gives me a patronising glance and then turns away and is sick, as if it revolted him to look at me, I come within an ace of occupying the entire front page of the evening papers as the latest murder sensation.","If you come to think of it, what a queer thing Life is! So unlike anything else, don\'t you know, if you see what I mean. At any moment you may be strolling peacefully along, and all the time Life\'s waiting around the corner to fetch you one.","It is not too much to say I was piqued to the tonsils.","His manner had the offensive jauntiness of the man who has had a cold bath when he might just as easily have had a hot one.","there occurred to me the simple epitaph which, when I am no more, I intend to have inscribed on my tombstone. It was this: \\"He was a man who acted from the best motives. There is one born every minute.","You don\'t need a hat to tax a man with stealing a pig,\' said the Hon.

She had","Into the emotional scene which followed I need not go in detail. You will have witnessed much the same sort of thing in the pictures, when the United States Marines arrive in the nick of time to relieve the beleaguered garrison. I may sum it up by saying that he fawned upon me.","Of course I think so. Have you forgotten what I told you the other day?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Lord Emsworth. He always forgot what people told him the other day.","Girls do go for the finely-chiselled. And apart from his looks, he\'s and artist, and there\'s something about artists that seems to act on the other sex like catnip on cats.","Hear him now as he toils.

As it rings softly out on the pleasant spring air, another stout slug has made the Great Change.","I worship her, Bertie! I worship the very ground she treads on!\\" continued the patient, in a loud, penetrating voice. Fred thompson and one or two fellows had come in, and McGarry, the chappie behind the bar, was listening with his ears flapping. But there\'s no reticence about Bingo. He always reminds me of the hero of a musical comedy who takes the centre of the stage, gathers the boys round him in a circle, and tells them all about his love at the top of his voice.","Too often on such occasions one feels, as I feel so strongly with regard to poor old Stilton, that the kindly thing to do would be to seize the prospective bridegroom\u2019s trousers in one\u2019s teeth and draw him back from danger, as faithful dogs do to their masters on the edge of precipices on dark nights.\u2019 \u2018Yes,","If you are ignorant of Lora Delane Porter\u2019s books that is your affair. Perhaps you are more to be pitied than censured. Nature probably gave you the wrong shape of forehead. Mrs. Porter herself would have put it down to some atavistic tendency or pre-natal influence. She put most things down to that. She blamed nearly all the defects of the modern world, from weak intellects to in-growing toe-nails, on long-dead ladies and gentlemen who, safe in the family vault, imagined that they had established their alibi. She subpoenaed grandfathers and even great-grandfathers to give evidence to show that the reason Twentieth-Century Willie squinted or had to spend his winters in Arizona was their own shocking health \u2018way back in the days beyond recall.","In a cozy corner of the electric flame department of the infernal regions there stands a little silver gridiron. It is the private property of his Satanic majesty, and is reserved exclusively for the man who invented amateur theatricals.","Furthermore, as is the case with so many of the younger literati, he dresses like a tramp cyclist, affecting turtleneck sweaters and grey flannel bags with a patch on the knee and conveying a sort of general suggestion of having been left out in the rain overnight in an ash can.","You see, I had decided - rightly or wrongly - to grow a moustache, and this had cut Jeeves to the quick. He couldn\'t stick the thing at any price, and I had been living ever since in an atmosphere of bally disapproval till I was getting jolly well fed up with it. What I mean is, while there\'s no doubt that in certain matters of dress Jeeves\'s judgment is absolutely sound and should be followed, it seemed to me that it was getting a bit too thick if he was going to edit my face as well as my costume. No one can call me an unreasonable chappie, and many\'s the time I\'ve given in like a lamb when Jeeves has voted against one of my pet suits or ties; but when it comes to a valet\'s staking out a claim on your upper lip you\'ve simply got to have a bit of the good old bulldog pluck and defy the blighter.","I\'m sorry. You do realize, don\'t you, that we are practically strangers? \'\'Girls often employ that specious argument on a man. Only to discover later that he was a tadpole and they were a fish in the Palazeoic age. And then they look silly.","He had that extra four or five inches of neck which disqualifies a man for high honors in the beauty competition","He was one of those supercilious striplings who give you the impression that you went to the wrong school and that your clothes don\'t fit.\\"This is Oswald,\\" said Bingo.\\"What,\\" I replied cordially, \\"could be sweeter?

A quiet life is what I like.","Boko looked at me, and raised his eyebrows. I looked at Boko, and raised my eyebrows. Nobby looked at us both, and raised her eyebrows. Then we looked at Stilton, and all raised our eyebrows. It was one of those big eyebrow-raising mornings.","Those who know Bertram Wooster best are aware that he is a man of sudden, strong enthusiasms and that, when in the grip of one of these, he becomes a remorseless machine\u2014tense, absorbed, single-minded.","I don\'t know anything that braces one up like finding you haven\'t got to get married after all.","I was as limpid as dammit.","Pretty soft!\' he cried. \'To have to come and live in New York!

I loathe New York, Bertie. I wouldn\'t come near the place if I hadn\'t got to see editors occasionally. There\'s a blight on it. It\'s got moral delirium tremens. It\'s the limit. The very thought of staying more than a day in it makes me sick. And you call this thing pretty soft for me!\'I felt rather like Lot\'s friends must have done when they dropped in for a quiet chat and their genial host began to criticise the Cities of the Plain. I had no idea old Rocky could be so eloquent.\'It would kill me to have to live in New York,\' he went on. \'To have to share the air with six million people!

As weird a gaggle of freaks and sub-humans as was ever collected in one spot.","The last few minutes of waiting in a cupboard are always the hardest.","The reactions of a country-house party to an after-dinner dog-fight in the drawing-room always vary considerably according to the individual natures of its members.

Their temperaments are much alike. My aunt has the same taste for the pleasures of the great city. It is a passion with her to ride in taxi-cabs, sir. Whenever the family take their eyes off her she escapes from the house and spends the day riding about in cabs. On several occasions she has broken into the children\'s savings bank to secure the means to enable her to gratify this desire.\'\'I love to have these little chats with you about your female relatives, Jeeves,\' I said coldly, for I felt that the man had let me down, and I was fed up with him. \'But I don\'t see what all this has got to do with my trouble.\'\'I beg your pardon, sir.

It may seem puzzling at first sight when ex-secretaries start falling as the gentle rain from heaven upon the lobelias beneath, but there is always a reason for it.","It would seem to be an inexorable law of Nature that no man shall shine at both ends. If he has a high forehead and a thirst for wisdom, his fox-trotting (if any) shall be as the staggerings of the drunken; while, if he is a good dancer, he is nearly always petrified from the ears upward.","Yes; Jimmy Mundy!\' she said. \'I am surprised at a man of your stamp having heard of him. There is no music, there are no drunken, dancing men, no shameless, flaunting women at his meetings; so for you they would have no attraction. But for others, less dead in sin, he has his message.

Still, he could balance himself with one hand on an inverted ginger-ale bottle while revolving a barrel on the soles of his feet. There is good in all of us.","Right ho, Jeeves.","All his life he had had a horror of definite appointments. An invitation to tea a week ahead had been enough to poison life for him.

She has about as much brain as a retarded billiards ball, and he approximately the same.","...anyone looking at you would write you off as a brainless nincompoop with about as much intelligence as a dead rabbit.","All political meetings are very much alike. Somebody gets up and introduces the speaker of the evening, and then the speaker of the evening says at great length what he thinks of the scandalous manner in which the Government is behaving or the iniquitous goings-on of the Opposition. From time to time confederates in the audience rise and ask carefully rehearsed questions, and are answered fully and satisfactorily by the orator. When a genuine heckler interrupts, the orator either ignores him, or says haughtily that he can find him arguments but cannot find him brains. Or, occasionally, when the question is an easy one, he answers it. A quietly conducted political meeting is one of England\'s most delightful indoor games. When the meeting is rowdy, the audience has more fun, but the speaker a good deal less.","But those who read thrillers are an impatient race. They chafe at scenic rhapsodies and want to get on to the rough stuff.","There is no pathos more bitter than that of parting from someone we have never met.","Young Bingo was too busy introducing the mob to take much notice.

The impossible had happened; Heaven had sent him an adventure, and he didn\'t care if it snowed.","I wouldn\u2019t have a face like that,\u2019 proceeded the child, with a good deal of earnestness, \u2018not if you gave me a million dollars.\u2019 He thought for a moment, then corrected himself. \u2018Two million dollars!\u2019 he added.","I say Bertie old man I am in love at last.

One may despair in New York, but it is difficult to brood on the past; for New York is the City of the Present, the City of Things that are Going On.","I\'m dashed if I know what\'s going to happen to me. I am the thingummy of what\'s-its-name.\\" \\"You look it,\\" said Mike.","This,\u2019 said Psmith, \u2018is becoming more and more gratifying every moment.

Some hold the view that a sorrow\'s crown of sorrow is remembering happier things, but Sir Gregory found that it gave him a melancholy pleasure to be wafted back into the golden past by perusing the details of the sort of dishes where you start off with a dozen eggs and use plenty of suet for the pastry. At the moment he was deep in the chapter about Chocolate Souffl\xe9. And he had just got to the part where the heroine takes two tablespoonfuls of butter and three ounces of Sunshine Sauce and was wondering how it all came out in the end, when he had a feeling that the air in the room had become a little close and, looking up, saw that he had a visitor. \'What the devil are you doing here?\' was his kindly greeting [...].","Poets, as a class, are business men. Shakespeare describes the poet\'s eye as rolling in a fine frenzy from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven, and giving to airy nothing a local habitation and a name, but in practice you will find that one corner of that eye is generally glued on the royalty returns.","Until tonight I saw him only through the golden mist of love, and thought him the perfect man.

About fifty yards east of the Ritz there is one of those blighted tea-and-bun shops you see dotted about all over London and into this, if you\'ll believe me, young Bingo dived like a homing rabbit; and before I had time to say a word we were wedged in at a table, on the brink of a silent pool of coffee left there by an early luncher.","The cheers of the multitude frequently act like a powerful drug upon young gentlemen with inferiority complexes.","perfect peace with loved ones far away","The man was goggling.

That he could have been a pal of mine all these years and think me capable of insulting the old tum with this sort of stuff cut me to the quick.\\"Or how about a bit of hot steak-pudding, with a sparkling limado to wash it down?\\" said Bingo.You know, the way love can change a fellow is really frightful to contemplate. This chappie before me, who spoke in that absolutely careless way of macaroons and limado, was the man I had seen in happier days telling the head-waiter at Claridge\'s exactly how he wanted the chef to prepare the sole frite au gourmet au champignons, and saying he would jolly well sling it back if it wasn\'t just right. Ghastly! Ghastly!A roll and butter and a small coffee seemed the only things on the list that hadn\'t been specially prepared by the nastier-minded members of the Borgia family for people they had a particular grudge against, so I chose them, and Mabel hopped it.","In the circles in which I move it is pretty generally recognized that I am a resilient sort of bimbo, and in circumstances where others might crack beneath the strain, may frequently be seen rising on stepping-stones of my dead self to higher things.","Lady Kimbuck\'s eyes gleamed.

I wonder,\\" said young Bingo thoughtfully, \\"if there\'s a chance of my getting any of that seven-to-one money? Seven to one! What a price! Who\'s offering it, do you know? Oh, well, I suppose it wouldn\'t do. No, I suppose it wouldn\'t be quite the thing.","But, Bill, old scout, your sister says there\'s a most corking links near here.\\"He turned and stared at me, and nearly ran us into the bank.\\"You don\'t mean honestly she said that?\\"\\"She said you said it was better than St. Andrews.\\"\\"So I did.

Slip a baby ten quid, he reasoned, and before you knew where you were you had got another Economic Royalist on your hands.","A man, to use an old-fashioned phrase, of some twenty-eight summers, he gave the impression at the moment of having experienced at least that number of very hard winters","Lady Constance conveyed the impression that anybody who had the choice between stealing anything from her and stirring up a nest of hornets with a short walking-stick would do well to choose the hornets.","When I have a leisure moment, you will generally find me curled up with Spinoza\'s latest.","...Cupid, who never shoots with a surer aim than through the steam of boarding-house hash, sniped him where he sat.","That is the peculiarity of London.

I will tell you. It is because this uncle is pure dynamite. Every time he is in Pongo\u2019s midst, with the sap running strongly in his veins, he subjects the unfortunate young egg to some soul-testing experience, luring him out into the open and there, right in the public eye, proceeding to step high, wide and plentiful.

By this, his lordship was to have whatever money he wished, but he must ask for it, and state why it was needed. If the request were reasonable, the cash would be forthcoming; if preposterous, it would not. The flaw in the scheme, from his lordship\'s point of view, was the difference of opinion that can exist in the minds of two men as to what the words reasonable and preposterous may be taken to mean. Twenty pounds, for instance, would, in the lexicon of Sir Thomas Blunt, be perfectly reasonable for the current expenses of a man engaged to Molly McEachern, but preposterous for one to whom she had declined to remain engaged.

After one look at some people even friendship is impossible. Such a one, in George\'s opinion, was this gurgling excrescence underneath the silk hat. He comprised in his single person practically all the qualities which George disliked most. He was, for a young man, extraordinarily obese. Already a second edition of his chin had been published, and the perfectly-cut morning coat which encased his upper section bulged out in an opulent semi-circle. He wore a little moustache, which to George\'s prejudiced eye seemed more a complaint than a moustache. His face was red, his manner dictatorial, and he was touched in the wind. Take him for all in all he looked like a bit of bad news.","One of the things which have caused the making of motion pictures to be listed among the Dangerous Trades is the fact that it has been found impossible to dispense with the temperamental female star. . . .

Shortness of memory keeps a man a chump when, but for it, he might cease to be one. Take my case, for instance. I\u2019m a chump. Well, if I had remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during my life, my size in hats would be about number nine. But I didn\u2019t. I forgot them.

The hand which grasped mine wrapped it round and enfolded it till I began to wonder if I\'d ever get it out without excavating machinery.","Had I been alone, a casual glance in passing would have contented me, but for Ukridge the spectacle of somebody else working always had an irresistible fascination, and, gripping my arm, he steered me up to assist him in giving the toiler moral support. About two minutes after he had started to breathe earnestly on the man\'s neck, the latter, seeming to become aware that what was tickling his back hair was not some wandering June zephyr, looked up with a certain petulance.","But lots of fellows have asked me who my tailor is.\\" \\"Doubtless in order to avoid him, sir.","We\'re all alike when we get bustled. We don\'t know what we\'re doing, and by the time we\'ve put our hands up and got into shape, why, it\'s all over, and there you are. Don\'t you worry yourself, sir.","This whole business of jacking up the soul is one that varies according to what Jeeves calls the psychology of the individual, some being all for it, others not. You take me, for instance. I don\u2019t say I\u2019ve got much of a soul, but, such as it is, I\u2019m perfectly satisfied with the little chap. I don\u2019t want people fooling about with it. \u2018Leave it alone,\u2019 I say. \u2018Don\u2019t touch it.

Not too hot, not too sweet, not too weak,","Life,\\" said Wesson, who had had time for reflection, \\"is a house which we all burgle. We enter it uninvited, take all that we can lay hands on, and go out again.","Many lyricists rhyme as they pronounce, and their pronunciation is simply horrible. They can make \\"home\\" rhyme with \\"alone,\\" and \\"saw\\" with \\"more,\\" and go right off and look their innocent children in the eye without a touch of shame.","Besides, a burglar is only a practical socialist. Philosophers talk a lot about the redistribution of wealth. The burglar goes out and does it.","It was a dashed tricky thing, of course, to have to decide on the spur of the moment. I was reading in the paper the other day about those birds who are trying to split the atom, the nub being that they haven\u2019t the foggiest as to what will happen if they do. It may be all right.","Joss raised his eyebrows.\'My dear J.B., when you madly dispensed with my services, you surely did not expect that a man of my gifts would be out of employment long? I was snapped up immediately. I have a sort of general commission to look after things here. You might call me the Claines Hall Fuhrer.\'\'Steptoe said you were his valet.\'\'Yes, that\'s another way of putting it.","Why did you come? Oh, I know what you are going to say. You felt that, cost what it might, you had to see me again, just once. You could not resist the urge to take away with you one last memory, which you could cherish down the lonely years. Oh, Bertie, you remind me of Rudel.The name was new to me.\u201cRudel?\u201d\u201cThe Seigneur Geoffrey Rudel, Prince of Blay-en-Saintonge.\u201dI shook my head.\u201cNever met him, I\u2019m afraid.

I hoped she was going to keep it clean.\u201cFor years he loved her, and at last could resist no longer. He took ship to Tripoli, and his servants carried him ashore.\u201d\u201cNot feeling so good?\u201d I said, groping. \u201cRough crossing?\u201d\u201cHe was dying.

Then he died.\u201dShe paused, and heaved a sigh that seemed to come straight up from the cami-knickers. A silence ensued.\u201cTerrific\u201d, I said, feeling that I had to say something, though personally I didn\u2019t think the story a patch on the one about the travelling salesman and the farmer\u2019s daughter. Different, of course, if one had known the chap.\u201d","What, in your opinion, will the harvest be?\\"\\"One finds it difficult to hazard a conjecture, sir.\\"\\"You mean imagination boggles?\\"\\"Yes, sir.\\"I inspected my imagination.

When he did so, he instantly became the center attraction to a rowdy mob of those gnats, moths, and beetles which collect in gangs and stay up late in the rural districts.

He was swallowing his sixth gnat when...","I remained motionless, like a ventriloquist\'s dummy whose ventriloquist has gone off to the local and left it sitting.","I can conceive that after what occurred in New York it might be distressing for you to encounter Miss Stoker, sir. But I fancy the contingency need scarcely arise.\u2019 I weighed this. \u2018When you start talking about contingencies arising, Jeeves, the brain seems to flicker and I rather miss the gist.

Whatever earthquakes and upheavals may be afflicting the general public, it stands aloof from them and just goes on being a duck.","It was as if Dante had recommended some lost soul in the Inferno to occupy his mind by knitting jumpers.","One of the many things Mike could never understand in Psmith was his fondness for getting into atmospheres that were not his own. He would go out of his way to do this. Mike, like most boys of his age, was never really happy and at his ease except in the presence of those of his own years and class. Psmith, on the contrary, seemed to be bored by them, and infinitely preferred talking to somebody who lived in quite another world.","It would have pained the immaculate Monty, could he have known that his prospective employer was picturing him at the moment as furtive, shifty-eyed, rat-like person of the gangster, type, liable at the first opportunity to sneak into the sties of innocent pigs and plant pineapple bombs in their bran-mash.","To say that the farmer laughed would be to express the matter feebly. That his young opponent, who had been irritating him unspeakably since the beginning of the game with advice and criticism, should have done exactly what he had cautioned him, the farmer, against a moment before, struck him as being the finest example of poetic justice he had ever heard of, and he signalized his appreciation of the same by nearly dying of apoplexy.","They have undoubtedly come to a bad end by this time. If bears were sent to attend to the children who criticised Elijah, your little friends were in line for a troupe of tigers. But there were some of a finer fibre?

It was about as juicy a biff as I had had for years.","It was a sticky wicket yesterday, sir, owing to the rain.\\" \\"Eh?\\" \\"The wicket was sticky, sir.\\" \\"Come again.\\" \\"I mean that the reason why the game yesterday struck you as slow was that the wicket\u2014I should say the turf\u2014was sticky\u2014that is to say wet. Sticky is the technical term, sir.

Please don\'t think me a foolish sentimentalist. If the order has gone out that the gang is to play croquet, and Number 6408, let us say, wants to play hopscotch, naturally you have to be firm. But discipline is one thing, harshness another. There is a difference between firmness and brutality.","Lady Jane held the English view that visitors like to be left to themselves.","Honestly, Ronnie. I know it hurts your head to think, but try just for a moment.","She\u2019s crazy. I wore a moustache my last year at Oxford, and it looked frightful. Nearly as loathsome as yours.

But until this moment he had hoped that Psmith was going to prove an agreeable change from the stream of literary lunatics which had been coming and going all that weary time. And lo! Psmith\u2019s name led all the rest. Even the man who had come for a week in April and had wanted to eat jam with his fish paled in comparison.","I\u2019ve often wondered since then how these murderer fellows manage to keep in shape while they\u2019re contemplating their next effort. I had a much simpler sort of job on hand, and the thought of it rattled me to such an extent in the night watches that I was a perfect wreck next day. Dark circles under the eyes\u2014","The thing that poisons life for gunmen and sometimes makes them wonder moodily if it is worth-while going on is this tendency of the outside public to butt in at inconvenient moments. Whenever you settle some business dispute with a commercial competitor by means of your sub-machine gun, it always turns out that there was some officious witness passing at the time, and there you are, with a new problem confronting you.","It is safest for the historian, if he values accuracy, to wait till a thing has happened before writing about it.","There was a moment\'s suspense while Conscience and Sheer Wickedness fought the matter out inside him, and then Conscience, which had started on the encounter without enthusiasm, being obviously flabby and out of condition, threw up the sponge.","Half the trouble in the world was caused by people not letting well alone.","To my daughter, without whose help this book would have been completed a long time back.","He\'s like one of those weird chappies in India who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where they want them.

Men with new religions drank tea with women with new hats. Apostles of Free Love expounded their doctrines to persons who had been practising them for years without realising it.

They had given her back Geoffrey, and with a careless generosity they had given her twice as much of him as she had expected.","Who was that lad they used to try to make me read at Oxford? Ship- Shop- Schopenhauer. That\'s the name. A grouch of the most pronounced description.","Percy felt for his complaisant friend something of the annoyance which a householder feels for the watchdog whom he finds fraternizing with the burglar.","Such a one, in George\'s opinion, was this gurgling excrescence underneath the silk hat. He comprised in his single person practically all the qualities which George disliked most. He was, for a young man, extraordinarily obese. Already a second edition of his chin had been published, and the perfectly-cut morning coat which encased his upper section bulged out in an opulent semi-circle. He wore a little moustache, which to George\'s prejudiced eye seemed more a complaint than a moustache.","The hatred which some of his order feel for Socialists and Demagogues Lord Marshmoreton kept for roseslugs, rose-beetles and the small, yellowish-white insect which is so depraved and sinister a character that it goes through life with an alias\u2014being sometimes called a rose-hopper and sometimes a thrips. A simple soul, Lord Marshmoreton\u2014mild and pleasant. Yet put him among the thrips, and he became a dealer-out of death and slaughter, a destroyer in the class of Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan. Thrips feed on the underside of rose leaves, sucking their juice and causing them to turn yellow; and Lord Marshmoreton\'s views on these things were so rigid that he would have poured whale-oil solution on his grandmother if he had found her on the underside of one of his rose leaves sucking its juice.","Inasmuch as the scene of this story is that historic pile, Belpher Castle, in the county of Hampshire, it would be an agreeable task to open it with a leisurely description of the place, followed by some notes on the history of the Earls of Marshmoreton, who have owned it since the fifteenth century.","The metropolitan touch sometimes proves a trifle too exotic for the provinces.","You could tell it was classical, because the banjo players were leaning back and chewing gum; and in New York restaurants only death or a classical speciality can stop banjoists.","Too often when a publisher entertains an author at the midday meal a rather sombre note tinges the table talk. The host is apt to sigh a good deal and to choose as the theme of his remarks the hardness of the times, the stagnant condition of the book trade and the growing price of pulp paper. And when his guest tries to cheer him up by suggesting that these disadvantages may be offset by a spirited policy of publicity, he sighs again and says that eulogies of an author\u2019s work displayed in the press at the publisher\u2019s expense are of little or no value, the only advertising that counts being\u2014how shall he put it\u2014well, what he might perhaps describe as word-of-mouth advertising.","I can\u2019t help your troubles, said Motty firmly. \u201cListen to me, old thing: this is the first time in my life that I\u2019ve had a real chance to yield to the temptations of a great city.

A New York summer night does not encourage optimism.","It was a generously-planned face. Nature seemed to have started out with the idea of making two faces and then to have decided to use all the material for one.","Like most people who have made a defiant and dramatic gesture and then have leisure to reflect, he was oppressed by a feeling that he had gone considerably farther than was prudent. Samson, as he heard the pillars of the temple begin to crack, must have felt the same. Gestures are all very well while the intoxication lasts. The trouble is that it lasts such a very little while.","He alluded in feeling terms to the Providence which watches over good young men and saves them from the blighting necessity of offering themselves in the flower of their golden youth as human sacrifices to the Moloch of capitalistic greed: and, having commiserated with his guests in that a similar stroke of luck had not happened to each of them, advised them to drown their sorrows in drink.","He couldn\'t have fallen in love with her in a couple of hours.\\"\\"Why not? I fell in love with her in a couple of minutes. I worshipped her immediately we met, the popeyed little excrescence.","He paused, and stole a glance at his wife. It was as he had feared. She had congealed. Like some spell, the name Jackson had apparently turned her to marble. It was like the Pygmalion and Galatea business working the wrong way round. She was presumably breathing, but there was no sign of it.","Don\'t do it. Women are the devil, whether they marry you or jilt you. Do you realise that women wear black evening dresses that have to be hooked up in a hurry when you are late for the theatre, and that, out of sheer wanton malignity, the hooks and eyes on those dresses are also made black? Do you realise...?","It seems rummy that water should be so much wetter when you go into it with your clothes on than when you\'re just bathing, but take it from me that it is.","Below him, the woolly dog raged like the ocean at the base of a cliff.","I sank into a c. and passed an agitated h. over the b.","As I stood in my lonely bedroom at the hotel, trying to tie my white tie myself, it struck me for the first time that there must be whole squads of chappies in the world who had to get along without a man to look after them. I\u2019d always thought of Jeeves as a kind of natural phenomenon; but, by Jove! of course, when you come to think of it, there must be quite a lot of fellows who have to press their own clothes themselves and haven\u2019t got anybody to bring them tea in the morning, and so on.","It seems incredible that we haven\'t met before. If you ask most people, they will tell you the difficult thing is to avoid meeting me.","Oily started, and a hot flush suffused his forehead. His professional pride was piqued. In no section of the community are class distinctions more rigid than among those who make a dishonest living by crime. The burglar looks down on the stick-up man, the stick-up man on the humbler practitioner who steals milk cans. Accuse a high-up confidence artist of petty larceny, and you bring out all the snob in him.","What a gruesome mess you must have been at three,\' said the Biscuit meditatively. \'You were bad enough at fourteen. At three you must have made strong men shudder.","Lord Emsworth was a man with little of the aggressor in his spiritual make-up. He believed in living and letting live. Except for his sister Constance, his secretary Lavender Briggs, the Duke of Dunstable and his younger son Frederick, now fortunately residing in America, few things were able to ruffle him. Placid is the word that springs to the lips. But the Church Lads had pierced his armour, and he found resentment growing within him like some shrub that has been treated with a patent fertilizer. He brooded bleakly on the injuries he had suffered at the hands of these juvenile delinquents. The","The Problem of Life seemed to him to be solved. He looked on down the years, and he could see no troubles there of any kind whatsoever.

Get to the point. And talk quick, darn it. Remember it\'s costing forty-five bucks every three minutes.\' For Mrs Moon was speaking from her apartment on Park Avenue, New York. And though it was the woman who would pay, waste even of other people\'s money was agony to Mr Frisby.

As we emerge from the twenties we grow into a habit of mind that looks askance at Fate bearing gifts.

Next moment the only thing that surprised him was the fact that he was not more surprised. There was something about this girl that made the most bizarre happenings seem right and natural. Ever since he had met her his life had changed from an orderly succession of uninteresting days to a strange carnival of the unexpected, and use was accustoming him to it. Life had taken on the quality of a dream, in which anything might happen and in which everything that did happen was to be accepted with the calmness natural in dreams.","Spode, also, seemed a good deal","jezail-bullets.","The first of the telegrams arrived shortly after noon, and Jeeves brought it in with the before-luncheon snifter. It was from Aunt Dahlia, operating from Market Snodsbury, a small town of sorts a mile or two along the main road as it leaves her country seat. It ran as follows:Come at once. Travers.And when I say it puzzled me like the dickens, I am understating it, if anything. As mysterious a communication, I considered, as was ever flashed over the wires. I studied it in a profound reverie for the best part of two dry Martinis and a dividend. I read it backwards. I read it forwards. As a matter of fact, I have a sort of recollection of even smelling it. But it still baffled me.","My God, man!\\" I gargled. \\"The cravat! The gent\'s neckwear! Why? For what reason?","I killed him with my niblick,\\" said Celia.I nodded. If the thing was to be done at all, it was unquestionably a niblick shot.","Most of the Underhills came into the world looking as though they meant to drive their way through life like a wedge.","Oh, is that my report, father? said Mike, with a sort of sickly interest, much as a dog about to be washed might evince in his tub.","If there were more men like you, Mr. Wooster, London would be a better place.\\"This was dead opposite to my Aunt Agatha\'s philosophy of life, she always having rather given me to understand that it is the presence in it of chappies like me that makes London more or less of a plague spot; but I let it go.","Scrubby, impecunious men drift to and fro there, waiting for the gods to provide something easy; and the prudent man, conscious of the possession of loose change, whizzes through the danger zone at his best speed, \u2018like one that on a lonesome road doth walk in fear and dread, and having once turned round walks on, and turns no more his head, because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread.","I ate cheese gravely.","He wore the unmistakable look of a man about to be present at a row between women, and only a wet cat in a strange back-yard bears itself with less jauntiness than a man faced by such a prospect. A millionaire several times over, Mr. Pett would cheerfully have given much of his wealth to have been elsewhere at that moment. Such was the agitated state of his mind that, when a hand was laid lightly upon his arm as he was about to follow his wife into the room, he started so violently that his hat flew out of his hand.","The antique shop in the Brompton Road proved, as fore-shadowed, to be an antique shop in the Brompton Road and, like all antique shops except the swanky ones in the Bond Street neigbourhood, dingy outside and dark and smelly within. I don\'t know why it is, but the proprietors of these establishments always seem to be cooking some sort of stew in the back room.","Every young man starting life ought to know how to cope with an angry swan, so I will briefly relate the proper procedure. You begin by picking up the raincoat which somebody has dropped; and then, judging the distance to a nicety, you simply shove the raincoat over the bird\u2019s head; and, taking the boat-hook which you have prudently brought with you, you insert it underneath the swan and heave. The swan goes into a bush and starts trying to unscramble itself; and you saunter back to your boat, taking with you any friends who may happen at the moment to be sitting on roofs in the vicinity. That was Jeeves\u2019s method, and I cannot see how it could have been improved upon.","Pat, you\'re absurd,\\" laughed Lady Jane. \\"I won\'t have you littering up the house with great, clumsy detectives. You must remember that you aren\'t in horrid New York now, where everybody you meet wants to rob you. Who is it that you suspect? Who is the\u2014what is the word you\'re so fond of? Crook. That\'s it. Who is the crook?","Among the compensations of advancing age is a wholesome pessimism which, while it takes the fine edge off whatever triumphs may come to us, has the admirable effect of preventing fate from working off on us any of those gold bricks, coins with strings attached, and unhatched chickens that which ardent youth snatches with such enthusiasm to its subsequent disappointment. As we emerge from the twenties, we grow into a habit of mind which looks askance at fate bearing gifts. We miss perhaps the occasional prize but we also avoid leaping lightheartedly into traps. Ash Marsin had yet to reach the age of tranquil mistrust and when fate seemed to be treating him kindly, he was still young enough to accept such kindnesses on its face value and rejoice in them. --Something Fresh","As Nebuchadnezzar is reported to have said of his vegetarian diet, it may have been wholesome, but it was not good.","I see. Before you fell a victim to the feverish desire for reckless speculation which is so marked a characteristic of the American business man, what?","A planter, apparently, does not consider he has had a drink unless it contains at least seven ingredients, and I\'m not saying, mind you, that he isn\'t right. The man behind the bar told us the things were called Green Swizzles; and, if ever I marry and have a son, Green Swizzle Wooster is the name that will go down on the register, in memory of the day his father\'s life was saved at Wembley.","Because I have already attended to the matter, sir. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYes, sir. I decided, after all, to acquiesce in your wishes.\u201d I stared at the man, astounded. I was deeply moved. Well, I mean, wouldn\u2019t any chap who had been going about thinking that the old feudal spirit was dead and then suddenly found it wasn\u2019t have been deeply moved? \u201cJeeves,\u201d I said, \u201cI am touched.\u201d","As Shakespeare says, if you\u2019re going to do a thing you might just as well pop right at it and get it over.","I don\'t know if you suffer in the same way, but with me the act of talking in the nature of real mashed potatoes always induces a sort of prickly sensation and a hideous feeling of shame, together with a marked starting of the pores.","A detective is only human. The less of a detective, the more human he is. Henry was not much of a detective, and his human","Sing,\' said the agent. \'Stop singing,\' added the agent, hastily.","There was Bobbie, ambling gently through life, a dear old chap in a hundred ways, but undoubtedly a chump of the first water. And there was Mary, determined that he shouldn\u2019t be a chump. And Nature, mind you, on Bobbie\u2019s side. When Nature makes a chump like dear old Bobbie, she\u2019s proud of him, and doesn\u2019t want her handiwork disturbed. She gives him a sort of natural armour to protect him against outside interference. And that armour is shortness of memory. Shortness of memory keeps a man a chump, when, but for it, he might cease to be one. Take my case, for instance. I\u2019m a chump. Well, if I had remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during my life, my size in hats would be about number nine. But I didn\u2019t. I forgot them. And it was just the same with Bobbie.","XVIII. THE LOCHINVAR METHOD XIX. ON THE LAKE XX. A LESSON IN PICQUET","ought I to dress it? What I mean is, the first act","Conscia mens recti, nec si sinit esse dolorem Sed revocare gradum.","Nobody is at his best in the matter of explanations if a lady whom he knows to be possessed of a firm belief in the incurable weakness of his intellect is looking fixedly at him during the recital.","The gods are business-like. They sell; they do not give. And for what they sell they demand a heavy price. We may buy life of them in many ways; with our honour, our health, our independence, our happiness; with our brains or with our hands. But somehow or other, in whatever currency we may choose to pay it, the price must be paid.","It was all too plainly her opinion that, if let loose in drawing rooms, I would immediately proceed to create an atmosphere reminiscent of a waterfront saloon when the Fleet is in.","Look in at the Drones and ask the first fellow you meet \'\'Can the fine spirit of the Woosters be crushed?\'\' and he will offer you attractive odds against such a contingency.","You are inviting disaster and... what\'s the word? Something about cats.\\" Jeeves replies, \\"Cataclysms, sir?","I found Lord Emsworth, Lady Constance, and told him the car was in readiness.\u2019 \u2018Oh, thank you, Miss Briggs. Where was he?\u2019 \u2018Down at the sty. Would there be anything furthah?\u2019 \u2018No thank you, Miss Briggs.\u2019 As the door closed, the Duke exploded with a loud report. \u2018Down at the sty!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t you have known it! Whenever you want him, he\u2019s down at the sty, gazing at that pig of his, absorbed, like somebody watching a strip-tease act. It\u2019s not wholesome for a man to worship a pig the way he does. Isn\u2019t there something in the Bible about the Israelites worshipping a pig? No, it was a golden calf, but the principle\u2019s the same. I tell you \u2026\u2019 He broke off. The door had opened again. Lord Emsworth stood on the threshold, his mild face agitated. \u2018Connie, I can\u2019t find my umbrella.\u2019 \u2018Oh, Clarence!\u2019 said Lady Constance with the exasperation the head of the family so often aroused in her, and hustled him out towards the cupboard in the hall where, as he should have known perfectly well, his umbrella had its home. Left alone, the Duke prowled about the room for some moments, chewing his moustache and examining his surroundings with popping eyes. He opened drawers, looked at books, stared at pictures, fiddled with pens and paper-knives. He picked up a photograph of Mr Schoonmaker and thought how right he had been in comparing his head to a pumpkin. He read the letter Lady Constance had been writing. Then, having exhausted all the entertainment the room had to offer, he sat down at the desk and gave himself up to thoughts of Lord Emsworth and the Empress. Every","Trouble sharpens the vision.","Mrs. Pett, like most other people, subconsciously held the view that the ruder a person is the more efficient he must be. It is but rarely that any one is found who is not dazzled by the glamour of incivility.","The world is full of men who ought never to shave their upper lip, and Blair Eggleston was one of them. Coming out into the open, as it were, like this, he had revealed himself the possessor of a not very good mouth. A peevish mouth. The sort of mouth that bred doubts in a girl.","Still, there it is, of course. The point to be considered now is, What will Aunt Agatha do about this? You know her, Jeeves. She is not like me. I\u2019m broad-minded. If Uncle George wants to marry waitresses, let him, say I. I hold that the rank is but the penny stamp\u2014\u2019 \u2018Guinea stamp, sir.\u2019 \u2018All right, guinea stamp. Though I don\u2019t believe there is such a thing. I shouldn\u2019t have thought they came higher than five bob.\'Wodehouse, P.G.. Very Good, Jeeves","London late at night -- or even in the daytime, for that matter -- is no place for a man in scarlet tights.","In the spring, Jeeves, a livelier iris gleams upon the burnished dove.\u2019 \u2018So","A few moments later the man was with us, looking so brainy and intelligent that my heart leaped up as if I had beheld a rainbow in the sky.\'Oh, Jeeves,\' I yipped.\'Oh, Jeeves,\' yipped Aunt Dahlia, dead heating with me.","Dear old Bicky, though a stout fellow and absolutely unrivaled as an imitator of bull-terriers and cats, was in many ways one of the most pronounced fatheads that ever pulled on a suit of gent\'s underwear.","You see I\u2019m wearing the tie,\u2019 said Bingo. \u2018It suits you beautiful,\u2019 said the girl. Personally, if anyone had told me that a tie like that suited me, I should have risen and struck them on the mazzard, regardless of their age and sex; but poor old Bingo simply got all flustered with gratification, and smirked in the most gruesome manner. \u2018Well,","Some say the tale related here \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is amplified and twisted; \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Some say it isn\'t very clear \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That William Tell existed; \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Some say he freed his country so, \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Governor demolished. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Perhaps he did. I only know \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That taxes aren\'t abolished!","One glance at the girl convinced R. Jones that he had been right. Circumstances had made him a rapid judge of character, for in profession of living by one\'s wits in a large city, the first principle of offence and defence is to sum people up at first sight.","He proposed to Alice Weston. She refused him. \'It\'s not because I\'m not fond of you. I think you\'re the nicest man I ever met.\' A good deal of assiduous attention had enabled Henry to win this place in her affections. He had worked patiently and well before actually putting his fortune to the test. \'I\'d marry you tomorrow if things were different. But I\'m on the stage, and I mean to stick there. Most of the girls want to get off it, but not me. And one thing I\'ll never do is marry someone who isn\'t in the profession. My sister Genevieve did, and look what happened to her. She married a commercial traveller, and take it from me he travelled.","England still firmly believes that wealth accrues to every resident of New York by some mysterious process not understandable of the Briton.","Defeat is the test of the great man. Your true general is not he who rides to triumph on the tide of an easy victory, but the one who, when crushed to earth, can bend himself to the task of planning methods of rising again.","Whatever his faults, he had strength; and after her experience of married life with a weak man, Lady Jane had come to the conclusion that strength was the only male quality worth consideration.","Jeeves was on a deck chair outside the back door, reading Spinoza with the cat Augustus on his lap. I had given him the Spinoza at Christmas and he was constantly immersed in it. I hadn\u2019t dipped into it myself, but he tells me it is good ripe stuff, well worth perusal.He would have risen at my approach, but I begged him to remain seated, for I knew that Augustus, like L. P. Runkle, resented being woken suddenly, and one always wants to consider a cat\u2019s feelings.","There is a point beyond which the human brain loses its kinship with the Infinite and becomes a mere seething mass of deleterious passions. Malays,","The gift of seeing ourselves as others see us is, as the poet indicates, vouchsafed to few men.","If there\u2019s one thing I like, it\u2019s a quiet life. I\u2019m not one of those fellows who get all restless and depressed if things aren\u2019t happening to them all the time. You can\u2019t make it too placid for me. Give me regular meals, a good show with decent music every now and then, and one or two pals to totter round with, and I ask no more.","Spink-Bottle, you ghastly goggle-eyed piece of gorgonzola","Major-General Sir Wilfred Bosher came to distribute the prizes at that school\', proceeded Gussie in a dull, toneless voice.\'He dropped a book. He stooped to pick it up. And, as he stooped, his trousers split up the back\'.\'How we roared!","And if I didn\u2019t burn the thing, how else could I get rid of it? Fellows on the battle-field eat dispatches to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy, but it would have taken me a year to eat Uncle Willoughby\u2019s Recollections.","You know, you smoke too much, Pat,\\" said his wife, seizing the opening with the instinct which makes an Irishman at a fair hit every head he sees.","Here, you! The boss wants you. Buck up!\' Mr Stafford was talking into the telephone. He replaced the receiver asHenry entered. \'Oh, Rice, here\'s a woman wants her husband shadowed while he\'s on the road.

The sheet didn\u2019t split, which pleased Gussie. Nobody came to interrupt us, which pleased me. And when I dropped the suitcase, it hit Gussie on the head, which delighted Aunt Dahlia. As for Jeeves, one could see that the faithful fellow was tickled pink at having been able to cluster round and save the young master in his hour of peril. His motto is \u2018Service.","It was not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church-door, but \u2018twas enough\u2014it served. Stubbing it squarely with his toe, Henry shot forward, all arms and legs. It","Now, a great many fellows think that having a rich uncle is a pretty soft snap: but, according to Corky, such is not the case.","... [A] single glance told him that here was somebody who was sitting on a pink cloud with a rainbow round his shoulder. Mr. Trout had not yet burst into song with a hey nonny nonny and a hotchacha, but when you said that you had said everything.","From the Hills of Fairyland soft music came. Or, if we must be exact, Maud spoke.","Look at the tall, thin one with the face like a motor-mascot. Has he ever done an honest day\u2019s work in his life? No! A prowler, a trifler, and a blood-sucker! And I bet he still owes his tailor for those trousers!","that he has got a pippin of an idea,","What it all boils down to, if you follow me, is that certain blokes \u2014 me, for example \u2014 have got much too much of the ready, while certain other blokes \u2014 the martyred proletariat, for instance \u2014 haven\'t got enough. This makes it fairly foul for the m.p., if you see what I mean.","I could not but feel that it was ironical that the old relative should have spoken disparagingly of fawns as a class, sneering at their timidity in that rather lofty and superior manner, for he himself could have walked straight into a gathering of these animals and no questions asked.","It serves to keep the records straight, and is a convenience to the public to whom one wants to do the square thing - affording as it does a bird\'s eye view of the position of affairs to those of his readers who, through no fault of their own, are not birds.","Many men in Packy\'s position would have shrunk from diving in to the rescue, fully clad. Packy was one of them.","Promptitude\u2014Courtesy\u2014Intelligence","A left jab from him had all the majesty of a formal declaration of war.","We shall get into that series of \u2018Husbands and Wives Who Work Together.","Surgit amari aliquid\u2019.","The ideal adventurer needs... the quality of not being content to mind his own affairs...","A breezy disregard for the preservation of the pence was a family trait.","I think that you would find a steady married man an improvement on these wild, flower-pot-throwing bachelors.
