But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself.","Six mistakes mankind keeps making century after century: Believing that personal gain is made by crushing others; Worrying about things that cannot be changed or corrected; Insisting that a thing is impossible because we cannot accomplish it; Refusing to set aside trivial preferences; Neglecting development and refinement of the mind; Attempting to compel others to believe and live as we do.","Politicians are not born; they are excreted.","Do not blame Caesar, blame the people of Rome who have so enthusiastically acclaimed and adored him and rejoiced in their loss of freedom and danced in his path and gave him triumphal processions. Blame the people who hail him when he speaks in the Forum of the \'new, wonderful good society\' which shall now be Rome, interpreted to mean \'more money, more ease, more security, more living fatly at the expense of the industrious.\'","Never was a government that was not composed of liars, malefactors and thieves.","When a government becomes powerful it is destructive, extravagant and violent; it is an usurer which takes bread from innocent mouths and deprives honorable men of their substance, for votes with which to perpetuate itself.","Though liberty is established by law, we must be vigilant, for liberty to enslave us is always present under that very liberty.  Our Constitution speaks of the \\"general welfare of the people.\\"  Under that phrase all sorts of excesses can be employed by lusting tyrants to make us bondsmen.","What society does to its children, so will its children do to society.","Poor is the nation that has no heroes, but poorer still is the nation that having heroes, fails to remember and honor them.","A nation can survive its fools, even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within....for the traitor appears not to be a traitor...he rots the soul of a nation...he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist.","There exists a law, not written down anywhere but inborn in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not from theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right.","To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child. For what is the worth of human life, unless it is woven into the life of our ancestors by the records of history?","Any man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists in his error.","Life without learning is death.","Within the character of the citizen, lies the welfare of the nation.","The higher we are placed, the more humbly we should walk.","If you wish to persuade me, you must think my thoughts, feel my feelings, and speak my words.","More is lost by indecision than wrong decision. Indecision is the thief of opportunity. It will steal you blind.","People don\'t know the value of what they have until it is gone: Freedom suppressed and again regained bites with keener fangs than freedom never endangered.... Liberty is rendered even more precious by the recollection of servitude. Don\'t wait till freedom is gone before you enjoy, value, support, protect and make the most of it!","Let the welfare of the people be the ultimate law.","A bureaucrat is the most despicable of men, though he is needed as vultures are needed, but one hardly admires vultures whom bureaucrats so strangely resemble. I have yet to meet a bureaucrat who was not petty, dull, almost witless, crafty or stupid, an oppressor or a thief, a holder of little authority in which he delights, as a boy delights in possessing a vicious dog. Who can trust such creatures?","Times are bad. Children no longer obey their parents, and everyone is writing a book.","The budget should be balanced, the treasury refilled, public debt reduced, the arrogance of officialdom tempered and controlled, and the assistance to foreign lands curtailed, lest Rome become bankrupt.","Read at every wait; read at all hours; read within leisure; read in times of labor; read as one goes in; read as one goest out. The task of the educated mind is simply put: read to lead.","It is the peculiar quality of a fool to perceive the faults of others and to forget his own.","If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need.","When you have no basis for an argument, abuse the plaintiff.","The wise are instructed by reason, average minds by experience, the stupid by necessity and the brute by instinct.","We learn nothing from history except that we learn nothing from history.","To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child.","Silence is one of the great arts of conversation.","The Jews belong to a dark and repulsive force. One knows how numerous this clique is, how they stick together and what power they exercise through their unions. They are a nation of rascals and deceivers.","If we are forced, at every hour, to watch or listen to horrible events, this constant stream of ghastly impressions will deprive even the most delicate among us of all respect for humanity.","Nothing is more unreliable than the populace, nothing more obscure than human intentions, nothing more deceptive than the whole electoral system.","They condemn what they do not understand.","It is not enough to acquire wisdom, it is necessary to employ it.","For out of such an ungoverned populace one is usually chosen as a leader, someone bold and unscrupulous who curries favor with the people by giving them other men\'s property. To such a man the protection of public office is given, and continually renewed. He emerges as a tyrant over the very people who raised him to power.","What is morally wrong can never be advantageous, even when it enables you to make some gain that you believe to be to your advantage. The mere act of believing that some wrongful course of action constitutes an advantage is pernicious.","More laws, less justice.","Nihil est incertius vulgo, nihil obscurius voluntate hominum, nihil fallacius ratione tota comitiorum. (Nothing is more unpredictable than the mob, nothing more obscure than public opinion, nothing more deceptive than the whole political system.)","The life of the dead is placed on the memories of the living. The love you gave in life keeps people alive beyond their time. Anyone who was given love will always live on in another\'s heart.","In a republic this rule ought to be observed: that the majority should not have the predominant power.","I have always been of the opinion that unpopularity earned by doing what is right is not unpopularity at all, but glory.","It is not by muscle, speed, or physical dexterity that great things are achieved, but by reflection, force of character, and judgment.","Friendship improves happiness and abates misery, by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief.","They who say that we should love our fellow-citizens but not foreigners, destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind, with which benevolence and justice would perish forever.","A man would have no pleasures in discovering all the beauties of the universe, even in heaven itself, unless he had a partner to whom he might communicate his joys.","No one dances sober, unless he is insane.","Next to God we are nothing. To God we are Everything.","There are two ways to resolve conflicts, through violence or through negotiation. Violence is for wild beasts, negotiation is for human beings.","To be content with what we possess is the greatest and most secure of riches.","Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.","The first duty of man is the seeking after and the investigation of truth.","As I give thought to the matter, I find four causes for the apparent misery of old age; first, it withdraws us from active accomplishments; second, it renders the body less powerful; third, it deprives us of almost all forms of enjoyment; fourth, it stands not far from death.","Nothing is so secure as that money will not defeat it.","If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.","Morals today are corrupted by our worship of riches.","They are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and the Germans are born with blond hair. I would not be in the least bit surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race.","A home without books is a body without soul.","I prefer tongue-tied knowledge to ignorant loquacity.","Enjoy the blessing of strength while you have it and do not bewail it when it is gone, unless, forsooth, you believe that youth must lament the loss of infancy, or early manhood the passing of youth. Life\'s race-course is fixed; Nature has only a single path and that path is run but once, and to each stage of existence has been allotted its own appropriate quality; so that the weakness of childhood, the impetuosity of youth, the seriousness of middle life, the maturity of old age.. each bears some of Nature\'s fruit, which must be garnered in its own season.","We should be careful that our benevolence does not exceed our means.","What then is freedom? The power to live as one wishes.","A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within.","The authority of those who teach is often an obstacle to those who want to learn.","We were born to unite with our fellow men, and to join in community with the human race.","Non nobis solum nati sumus. (Not for ourselves alone are we born.)","Man was born for two things--thinking and acting.","Whatever you do, do with all your might.","The greater the difficulty, the greater the glory.","If our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right.","We should be as careful of our words as of our actions.","We forget our pleasures, we remember our sufferings.","Extreme justice is extreme injustice.","Man must suffer to be wise.","Through doubt we arrive at the truth.","Long life is denied us; therefore let us do something to show that we have lived.","In this statement, my Scipio, I build on your own admirable definition, that there can be no community, properly so called, unless it be regulated by a combination of rights. And by this definition it appears that a multitude of men may be just as tyrannical as a single despot and indeed this is the most odious of all tyrannies, since no monster can be more barbarous than the mob, which assumes the name and mask of the people.","There is no one who can give you wiser advice than you can give yourself: you will never make a slip, if you listen to your own heart.","By doubting we come at truth.","Please go on, make your threats. I don\'t like to submit to mere implication.","It is as hard for the good to suspect evil, as it is for the bad to suspect good.","When time and need require, we should resist with all our might, and prefer death to slavery and disgrace.","Let us not listen to those who think we ought to be angry with our enemies, and who believe this to be great and manly. Nothing is so praiseworthy, nothing so clearly shows a great and noble soul, as clemency and readiness to forgive.","To err is human, but to persevere in error is only the act of a fool.","Dum Spiro, spero- As long as I breathe, I hope.","The life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living.","Those who do not know history will forever remain children","Of all nature\'s gifts to the human race, what is sweeter to a man than his children?","If we are not ashamed to think it, we should not be ashamed to say it.","No one has the right to be sorry for himself for a misfortune that strikes everyone.","Too much liberty leads both men and nations to slavery.","Men do not realize how great an income thrift is.","There is no duty more indispensible than that of returning a kindness.","Wisdom is the only thing which can relieve us from the sway of the passions and the fear of danger, and which can teach us to bear the injuries of fortune itself with moderation, and which shows us all the ways which lead to tranquility and peace.","It is a crime to put a Roman citizen in chains, it is an enormity to flog one, sheer murder to slay one: what, then, shall I say of crucifixion? It is impossible to find the word for such an abomination.","There is nothing so charming as the knowledge of literature; of that branch of literature, I mean, which enables us to discover the infinity of things, the immensity of Nature, the heavens, the earth, and the seas; this is that branch which has taught us religion, moderation, magnanimity, and that has rescued the soul from obscurity; to make her see all things above and below, first and last, and between both; it is this that furnishes us wherewith to live well and happily, and guides us to pass our lives without displeasure and without offence.","The pursuit, even of the best things, ought to be calm and tranquil.","Let your desires be ruled by reason.","No wise man ever thought that a traitor should be trusted.","What nobler employment, or more valuable to the state, than that of the man who instructs the rising generation?","It is difficult to persuade mankind that the love of virtue is the love of themselves.","I prefer the most unfair peace to the most righteous war.","The countenance is the portrait of the soul, and the eyes mark its intentions.","The men who administer public affairs must first of all see that everyone holds onto what is his, and that private men are never deprived of their goods by public men.","Everything is alive... Everything is interconnected.","The recovery of freedom is so splendid a thing that we must not shun even death when seeking to recover it.","It is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigor.","Wisdom often exists under a shabby coat.","We study history not to be clever in another time, but to be wise always.","A man of courage is also full of faith.","The higher our position the more modestly we should behave.","I hear Socrates saying that the best seasoning for food is hunger; for drink, thirst.","Any man may make a mistake; none but a fool will stick to it. Second thoughts are best as the proverb says.","Men, in whatever anxiety they may be, if they are men, sometimes indulge in relaxation.","The more virtuous any man is, the less easily does he suspect others to be vicious.","If we lose affection and kindliness from our life: we lose all that gives it charm.","The life given us, by nature is short; but the memory of a well-spent life is eternal.","You will be as much value to others as you have been to yourself.","Brevity is a great charm of eloquence.","Most happy is he who is entirely self-reliant, and who centers all his requirements in himself alone.","Cultivation to the mind is as necessary as food to the body.","The more laws, the less justice.","There never was a great soul that did not have some divine inspiration.","When you wish to instruct, be brief; that men\'s [children\'s] minds take in quickly what you say, learn its lesson, and retain it faithfully. Every word that is unnecessary only pours over the side of a brimming mind.","We are obliged to respect, defend and maintain the common bonds of union and fellowship that exist among all members of the human race.","Whatever is done without ostentation, and without the people being witnesses of it, is, in my opinion, most praiseworthy: not that the public eye should be entirely avoided, for good actions desire to be placed in the light; but notwithstanding this, the greatest theater for virtue is conscience.","Not only is there an art in knowing a thing, but also a certain art in teaching it.","The first law for the historian is that he shall never dare utter an untruth. The second is that he shall suppress nothing that is true. Moreover, there shall be no suspicion of partiality in his writing, or of malice.","Probabilities direct the conduct of the wise man.","Genius is fostered by industry.","Just as the soul fills the body, so God fills the world. Just as the soul bears the body, so God endures the world. Just as the soul sees but is not seen, so God sees but is not seen. Just as the soul feeds the body, so God gives food to the world.","It is the nature of every person to error, but only the fool perseveres in error.","It is a man\'s own dishonesty, his crimes, his wickedness, and boldness, that takes away from him soundness of mind; these are the furies, these the flames and firebrands, of the wicked.","Our minds possess by nature an insatiable desire to know the truth.","What is dishonorably got, is dishonorably squandered.","Sweet is the recollection of difficulties overcome.","I prefer the wisdom of the uneducated to the folly of the loquacious.","Vivere est cogitare. (To think is to live)","Nature has granted the use of life like a loan, without fixing any day for repayment.","Every man should bear his own grievances rather than detract from the comforts of another.","Time obliterates the fictions of opinion and confirms the decisions of nature.","I cheerfully quit from life as if it were an inn, not a home; for Nature has given us a hostelry in which to sojourn, not to abide.","Your enemies can kill you, but only your friends can hurt you.","Crimes are not to be measured by the issue of events, but by the bad intentions of men.","You must therefore love me, myself, and not my circumstances, if we are to be real friends.","Man is his own worst enemy.\\n[Lat., Nihil inimicius quam sibi ipse.]","Every evil in the bud is easily crushed: as it grows older, it becomes stronger.","Exercise and temperance can preserve something of our early strength even in old age.","It is necessary for a Senator to be thoroughly acquainted with the constitution; and this is a knowledge of the most extensive nature; a matter of science, of diligence, of reflection, without which no Senator can possibly be fit for his office.","Every word that is unnecessary only pours over the side of a brimming mind.","The enemy is within the gates; it is with our own luxury, our own folly, our own criminality that we have to contend.","God\'s law is \'right reason.\' When perfectly understood it is called \'wisdom.\' When applied by government in regulating human relations it is called \'justice.","Virtue is its own reward.","Each part of life has its own pleasures.  Each has its own abundant harvest, to be garnered in season.  We may grow old in body, but we need never grow old in mind and spirit.  No one is as old as to think he or she cannot live one more year.","If anyone cannot feel the power of God when he looks upon the stars, then I doubt whether he is capable of feeling at all. From the enduring wonder of the heavens flows all grace and power. If anyone thinks it is mindless then he himself must be out of his mind.","Before beginning, plan carefully.","What is permissible is not always honorable.","The most evident difference between man and animals is this: the beast, in as much as it is largely motivated by the senses and with little perception of the past or future, lives only for the present. But man, because he is endowed with reason by which he is able to perceive relationships, sees the causes of things, understands the reciprocal nature of cause and effect, makes analogies, easily surveys the whole course of his life, and makes the necessary preparations for its conduct.","Sound conviction should influence us rather than public opinion.","Trust no one unless you have eaten much salt with him.","Our generosity never should exceed our abilities.","The rule of friendship means there should be mutual sympathy between them, each supplying what the other lacks and trying to benefit the other, always using friendly and sincere words.","Orators are most vehement when they have the weakest cause, as men get on horseback when they cannot walk.","It is better to receive than to do injury.","While all other things are uncertain, evanescent, and ephemeral, virtue alone is fixed with deep roots; it can neither be overthrown by any violence or moved from its place.","Nature has planted in our minds an insatiable longing to see the truth.","Friends, though absent, are still present.","We are motivated by a keen desire for praise, and the better a man is the more he is inspired by glory. The very philosophers themselves, even in those books which they write in contempt of glory, inscribe their names.","There is no duty more obligatory than the repayment of kindness.","Hunger is the best sauce.","The wise man knows nothing if he cannot benefit from his wisdom. Wisdom is not only to be acquired, but also to be utilized.","The multitude of fools is a protection to the wise.","Memory is the treasury and guardian of all things.","To live long, live slowly.","It is the character of a brave and resolute man not to be ruffled by adversity and not to desert his post.","It is fortune, not wisdom, that rules man\'s life.","There is nothing which God cannot do.\\n[Lat., Nihil est quod deus efficere non possit.]","If some lose their whole fortunes, they will drag many more down with them . . . believe me that the whole system of credit and finance which is carried on here at Rome in the Forum, is inextricably bound up with the revenues of the Asiatic province. If Those revenues are destroyed, our whole system of credit will come down with a crash.","When money is unreasonably coveted, it is a disease of the mind which is called avarice.","I shall always consider the best guesser the best prophet.","Study carefully, the character of the one you recommend, lest their misconduct bring you shame.","In so far as the mind is stronger than the body, so are the ills contracted by the mind more severe than those contracted by the body.","The strictest law often causes the most serious wrong","The world has not yet learned the riches of frugality.","Probability is the very guide of life.","A mind without instruction can no more bear fruit than can a field, however fertile, without cultivation.","Whatever is graceful is virtuous, and whatever is virtuous is graceful.","Advice in old age is foolish; for what can be more absurd than to increase our provisions for the road the nearer we approach to our journey\'s end.","An acute first-class brain is the finest asset anyone can have- and, if we want to be happy, it is an asset we must exploit to the uttermost.","Wisdom is not only to be acquired, but enjoyed.","Nobody can give you wiser advice than yourself; you will never err if you listen to your own suggestions.","Hatreds not vowed and concealed are to be feared more than those openly declared.","Thus in the beginning the world was so made that certain signs come before certain events.","There are no true friends in politics.","There is sufficient reward in the mere consciousness of a good action.","Reason should direct, and appetite obey.","In a discussion of this kind our interest should be centered not on the weight of the authority but on the weight of the argument. Indeed the authority of those who set out to teach is often an impediment to those who wish to learn. They cease to use their own judgment and regard as gospel whatever is put forward by their chosen teacher.","When I consider the wonderful activity of the mind, so great a memory of what is past, and such a capacity of penetrating into the future: when I behold such a number of arts and sciences, and such a multitude of discoveries hence arising,--I believe and am firmly persuaded that a nature which contains so many things within itself cannot be mortal.","It is not only arrogant, but it is profligate, for a man to disregard the world\'s opinion of himself.","It is graceful in a man to think and to speak with propriety, to act with deliberation, and in every occurrence of life to find out and persevere in the truth. On the other hand, to be imposed upon, to mistake, to falter, and to be deceived, is as ungraceful as to rave or to be insane.","It is virtue itself that produces and sustains friendship, not without virtue can friendship by any possibility exist.","Never injure a friend, even in jest.","The diseases of the mind are more and more destructive than those of the body.\\n[Lat., Morbi perniciores pluresque animi quam corporis.]","As I approve of a youth that has something of the old man in him, so I am no less pleased with an old man that has something of the youth. He that follows this rule may be old in body, but can never be so in mind.","For surely to be wise is the most desirable thing in all the world.","To stumble twice against the same stone, is a proverbsial disgrace.","To give counsel, as well as to take it, is a feature of true friendship.","It shows a weak mind not to bear prosperity as well as adversity with moderation.","Laws are inoperative in war","Would that I could discover truth as easily as I can uncover falsehood.","It is not enough merely possess virtue, as if it were an art; it should be practiced.","Politeness and an affable address are our best introduction.","It was fear that was then making you a good citizen, which is never a lasting teacher of duty.","If the truth were self-evident, eloquence would be unnecessary.","Rightly defined philosophy is simply the love of wisdom.","In all matters, before beginning, a diligent preparation should be made.","Freedom suppressed and again regained bites with keener fangs than freedom never endangered.","Civilized people are taught by logic, barbarians, by necessity, communities by tradition; and the lesson inculcated even in wild beasts by nature itself. They learn that they have to defend their own bodies and persons lives from violence of any and every kind by all means within their power.","This excessive licence, which the anarchists think is the only true freedom, provides the stock, as it were, from which a tyrant grows.","The man who backbites an absent friend, nay, who does not stand up for him when another blames him, the man who angles for bursts of laughter and for the repute of a wit, who can invent what he never saw, who cannot keep a secret -- that man is black at heart: mark and avoid him.","An agreement of rash men (a conspiracy).","It is foolish to tear one\'s hair in grief, as though sorrow would be made less by baldness.","I never admire another\'s fortune so much that I became dissatisfied with my own.","All pain is either severe or slight, if slight, it is easily endured; if severe, it will without doubt be brief.","There is no castle so strong that it cannot be overthrown by money.","Brevity is the best recommendation of speech, whether in a senator or an orator.","I criticize by creation - not by finding fault.","Care should be taken that the punishment does not exceed the guilt; and also that some men do not suffer for offenses for which others are not even indicted.","In friendship we find nothing false or insincere; everything is straight forward, and springs from the heart.","The house should derive dignity from the master, not the master from the house.","He has no worse enemy than himself.","Nature herself makes the wise man rich.","The rabble estimate few things according to their real value, most things according to their prejudices.","There is no place more delightful than home.","In prosperity let us most carefully avoid pride, disdain, and arrogance.","Vicious habits are so odious and degrading that they transform the individual who practices them into an incarnate demon.","The man who commands efficiently must have obeyed others in the past, and the man who obeys dutifully is worthy of someday being a commander.","We can more easily avenge an injury than requite a kindness; on this account, because there is less difficulty in getting the better of the wicked than in making one\'s self equal with the good.","To add a library to a house is to give that house a soul.","O tempora! O mores!\\nO what times (are these)! what morals!","After victory, you have more enemies.","That last day does not bring extinction to us, but change of place.","A thankful heart is not only the greatest virtue but the parent of all the other virtues.","I am never less alone than when alone.","Nothing is so unbelievable that oratory cannot make it acceptable.","The name of peace is sweet, and the thing itself is beneficial, but there is a great difference between peace and servitude. Peace is freedom in tranquillity, servitude is the worst of all evils, to be resisted not only by war, but even by death.","What is dignity without honesty?","Do not hold the delusion that your advancement is accomplished by crushing others.","There are gems of thought that are ageless and eternal.","How much in love with himself, and that too without a rival!","I do not understand what the man who is happy wants in order to be happier.","The Intellect engages us in the pursuit of Truth. The Passions impel us to Action.","The good of the people is the greatest law.","So near is falsehood to truth that a wise man would do well not to trust himself on the narrow edge.","Judge not by the number, but by the weight.","A thankful heart is the greatest virtue.","In anger nothing right nor judicious can be done.","Ability without honor is useless.","Glory follows virtue as if it were its shadow.","There is no grief which time does not lessen and soften.","We all are imbued with the love of praise.","Prosperity demands of us more prudence and moderation than adversity.","If a man cannot feel the power of God when he looks upon the stars, then I doubt whether he is capable of any feeling at all.","Friendship is the only thing in the world concerning the usefulness of which all mankind are agreed.","In ancient times music was the foundation of all the sciences. Education was begun with music with the persuasion that nothing could be expected of a man who was ignorant of music.","It is not easy to distinguish between true and false affection, unless there occur one of those crises in which, as gold is tried by fire, so a faithful friendship may be tested by danger.","While the sick man has life, there is hope.","An army abroad is of little use unless there are prudent counsels at home.\\n[Lat., Parvi enim sunt foris arma, nisi est consilium domi.]","The face is a picture of the mind with the eyes as its interpreter.","Promises are not to be kept, if the keeping of them is to prove harmful to those to whom you have made them.","It shows a brave and resolute spirit not to be agitated in exciting circumstances.","The mere act of believing that some wrongful course of action constitutes an advantage is pernicious.","The works of nature must all be accounted good.","To teach is a necessity, to please is a sweetness, to persuade is a victory.","History is the teacher of life","As fire when thrown into water is cooled down and put out, so also a false accusation when brought against a man of the purest and holiest character, boils over and is at once dissipated, and vanishes.","I remember the very thing that I do not wish to; I cannot forget the things I wish to forget.","Superstition is an unreasoning fear of God.","Courage is virtue which champions the cause of right.","Knowledge which is divorced from justice, may be called cunning rather than wisdom.","Let the punishment be proportionate to the offense.","Prudence is the knowledge of things to be sought, and those to be shunned.","The safety of the people shall be the highest law.","An unjust peace is better than a just war.","The most desirable thing in life after health and modest means is leisure with dignity.","Diseases of the soul are more dangerous and more numerous than those of the body.","Tomorrow will give us something to think about","Borrowing from Peter to pay Paul.","History is indeed the witness of the times, the light of truth.","The harvest of old age is the recollection and abundance of blessing previously secured.","A person who is wise does nothing against their will, nothing with sighing or under coercion.","The gods attend to great matters, they neglect small ones.","Whatever befalls in accordance with nature should be accounted good.","Virtue and decency are so nearly related that it is difficult to separate them from each other but in our imagination.","Persistence in a single view has never been regarded as a merit in political leaders.","Strict law is often great injustice.","It is difficult to tell how much men\'s minds are conciliated by a kind manner and gentle speech.","We ought to regard amiability as the quality of woman, dignity that of man.","Anyone may fairly seek his own advantage, but no one has a right to do so at another\'s expense.","I look upon the pleasure which we take in a garden as one of the most innocent delights in human life. . . It gives us a great insight into the contrivance and wisdom of Nature, and suggests innumerable subjects for meditation.","Things perfected by nature are better than those finished by art.","History is the witness that testifies to the passing of time.","The absolute good is not a matter of opinion but of nature.","Rashness belongs to youth; prudence to old age.","Learning is a kind of natural food for the mind.","Nor am I ashamed, as some are, to confess my ignorance of those matters with which I am unacquainted.","A bachelor\'s bed is the most pleasant.","Generosity should never exceed ability.","The administration of government, like a guardianship ought to be directed to the good of those who confer, not of those who receive the trust.","The impulse which directs to right conduct, and deters from crime, is not only older than the ages of nations and cities, but coeval with that Divine Being who sees and rules both heaven and earth.","Freedom is participation in power.","Be a pattern to others and then all will go well.","You may never be less alone than when you are alone.","Grief is not in the nature of things, but in opinion.","The false is nothing but an imitation of the true.","There is no mortal whom pain and disease do not reach.","Should this my firm persuasion of the soul\'s immortality prove to be a mere delusion, it is at least a pleasing delusion, and I will cherish it to my last breath.","Advice is judged by results, not by intentions.","Vicious habits are so great a stain to human nature, and so odious in themselves, that every person actuated by right reason would avoid them, though he were sure they would be always concealed both from God and man, and had no future punishment entailed upon them.","No liberal man would impute a charge of unsteadiness to another for having changed his opinion.","Men of different tastes have different pursuits.","The master sometimes serves, and the servant sometimes is master.","Laws are silent in time of war.","The great theatre for virtue is conscience.","Friends are proved by adversity.","Hatred is a settled anger.","Every stage of human life, except the last, is marked out by certain and defined limits; old age alone has no precise and determinate boundary.","As in the case of wines that improve with age, the oldest friendships ought to be the most delightful.","Even while Jerusalem was standing and the Jews were at peace with us, the practice of their sacred rites was at variance with the glory of our empire, the dignity of our name, the customs of our ancestors.","We are bound by the law, so that we may be free.","All soils are not fertile.","He who acknowledges a kindness has it still, and he who has a grateful sense of it has requited it.","Thou knowest how numerous this tribe is, how united and how powerful in the assemblies. I will plead in a low voice so that only the judges may hear, for instigators are not lacking to stir up the crowd against me, and against all the best citizens.

But we ought to be assured, since the boundaries of good and evil are now discovered, as far as they are discoverable by man, that nothing can be desired of philosophy greater or more useful than the discussions which we have held these four days. For besides instilling a contempt of death, and relieving pain so as to enable men to bear it, we have added the appeasing of grief, than which there is no greater evil to man. For though every perturbation of mind is grievous, and differs but little from madness, yet we are used to say of others when they are under any perturbation, as of fear, joy, or desire, that they are agitated and disturbed; but of those who give themselves up to grief, that they are miserable, afflicted, wretched, unhappy. So that it doth not seem to be by accident, but with reason proposed by you, that I should discuss grief, and the other perturbations separately; for there lies the spring and head of all our miseries; but the cure of grief, and of other disorders, is one and the same in that they are all voluntary, and founded on opinion; we take them on ourselves because it seems right so to do. Philosophy undertakes to eradicate this error, as the root of all our evils: let us therefore surrender ourselves to be instructed by it, and suffer ourselves to be cured; for while these evils have possession of us, we not only cannot be happy, but cannot be right in our minds. We must either deny that reason can effect anything, while, on the other hand, nothing can be done right without reason, or else, since philosophy depends on the deductions of reason, we must seek from her, if we would be good or happy, every help and assistance for living well and happily.","Nam eloquentiam quae admirationem non habet nullam iudico","We are born for justice, and . . . what is just is based, not on opinion, but on nature.","\u0427\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0437\u043b\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438","Aquele que se ama a si pr\xf3prio n\xe3o tem rivais","The things possessing most utility also have the greatest amount of dignity, and indeed frequently of beauty also.

It ought to be destroyed, uprooted altogether.","The brief arc of our days,O Sestius,prevents us from launching prolonged hopes.","As I gazed rather intently at the earth my grandfather said: How long will your thoughts continue to dwell upon the earth?","Wenn du einen Garten und eine Bibliothek hast, wird Dir an nichts fehlen.","O noble philosophy! Why, they seem to take the sun out of the universe when they deprive life of friendship, than which we have from the immortal gods no better, no more delightful boon.","he grew old learning many a fresh lesson every day.","For of what value is their vaunted \'freedom from care\'? In appearance it is indeed an alluring thing, but in reality often to be shunned. For it is inconsistent not to undertake any honourable business or course of conduct, or to lay it aside when undertaken, in order to avoid anxiety. Nay, if we continually flee from trouble, we must also flee from Virtue, who necessarily meets with some trouble in rejecting and loathing things contrary to herself, as when kindness rejects ill-will, temperance lust, and bravery cowardice. And so you may see that it is the just who are most pained at injustice, the brave at cowardice, the self-restrained at profligacy. It is, therefore, characteristic of the well-ordered mind both to rejoice at good deeds and to be pained at the reverse.","For when the soul is deprived of emotion, what difference is there \u2014 I do not say between man and the beasts of the field, but between man and a stock or a stone, or any such thing?","Zoals de dwaasheid nooit tevreden is, zelfs niet als haar wensen worden vervuld, zo is de wijsheid steeds tevreden met wat voorhanden is, en heeft nooit onvrede met zichzelf.","For is there anything so absurd as to delight in many inanimate things, like public office, fame, and stately buildings, or dress and personal adornment, and to take little or no delight in a sentient being endowed with virtue and capable of loving, and \u2014 if I may so term it \u2014 of loving back?","But what is more foolish, when men are in the plenitude of resources, opportunities, and wealth, than to procure the other things which money provides \u2014 horses, slaves, splendid raiment, and costly plate \u2014 and not procure friends, who are, if I may say so, life\'s best and fairest furniture?","But worst of all is the third limitation, which is that \'whatever value a man places upon himself, the same value should be placed upon him by his friends.\' For often in some men either the spirit is too dejected, or the hope of bettering their fortune is too faint. Therefore, it is not the province of a friend, in such a case, to have the same estimate of another that the other has of himself, but rather it is his duty to strive with all his might to arouse his friend\'s prostrate soul and lead it to a livelier hope and into a better train of thought.","Nor is it easy to find men who will go down to calamity\'s depths for a friend. Ennius, however, is right when he says:When Fortune\'s fickle the faithful friend is found;yet it is on these two charges that most men are convicted of fickleness: they either hold a friend of little value when their own affairs are prosperous, or they abandon him when his are adverse. Whoever, therefore, in either of these contingencies, has shown himself staunch, immovable, and firm in friendship ought to be considered to belong to that class of men which is exceedingly rare \u2014 aye, almost divine.","Utinam tam facile vera invenire possim quam falsa convincere.","Quid? Quod eadem mente res dissimillimas comprehendimus, ut colorem saporem, calorem, odorem, sonum? Quae numquam quinque nuntiis animus cognosceret, nisi ad eum omnia referrentur et is omnium iudex solus esset.","Hatreds not voiced, but which are concealed, is to be feared more than those openly declared.","Historia vero testistemporum, lux veritatis,vita memoriae, magistra vitae.History is the witness of the times, the light oftruth, the life of memory,the mistress of life.","Elephanto beluarum nulla prudentior: at figura quae vastior? De bestiis loquor: quid, inter ipsos homines nonne et simillimis formis dispares mores et moribus simillimis figura dissimilis? (1.97 De Natura Deorum)","Likewise other things, which seem to some to be worthy of admiration, are by many thought to be of no value at all. But concerning friendship, all, to a man, think the same thing: those who have devoted themselves to public life; those who find their joy in science and philosophy; those who manage their own business free from public cares; and, finally, those who are wholly given up to sensual pleasures \u2014 all believe that without friendship life is no life at all, or at least they so believe if they have any desire whatever to live the life of free men.","Whether it is a natural instinct or a mere illusion, I can\u2019t say; but one\u2019s emotions are more strongly aroused by seeing the places that tradition records to have been the favourite resort of men of note in former days, than by hearing about their deeds or reading their writings. My own feelings at the present moment are a case in point. I am reminded of Plato, the first philosopher, so we are told, that made a practice of holding discussions in this place;","By this time I was thoroughly terrified, not so much fearing death as the treachery of my own kind.","statuere enim qui sit sapiens vel maxime videtur esse sapientis","And yet, as to where the blame for this misunderstanding resides, I can more easily conceive than write: since I am afraid that, while defending my own relations, I should not spare yours.","But inasmuch as things human are frail and fleeting, we must be ever on the search for some persons whom we shall love and who will love us in return; for if goodwill and affection are taken away, every joy is taken from life. For me, indeed, though he was suddenly snatched away, Scipio still lives and will always live; for it was his virtue that caused my love and that is not dead.","This is all that I had to say about friendship; but I exhort you both so to esteem virtue (without which friendship cannot exist), that, excepting virtue, you will think nothing more excellent than friendship.","Justice is the mistress and queen of all the virtues.","It is to this effect: If a man should ascend alone into heaven and behold clearly the structure of the universe and the beauty of the stars, there would be no pleasure for him in the awe-inspiring sight, which would have filled him with delight if he had had someone to whom he could describe what he had seen. Thus nature, loving nothing solitary, always strives for some sort of support, and man\'s best support is a very dear friend.","Denn wirklich tugendhaft wollen nicht so Viele\xa0sein\xa0als\xa0scheinen.","That which is in itself in accordance with nature, or which produces something else that is so, and which therefore is deserving of choice as possessing a certain amount of positive value\u2014axia as the Stoics call it\u2014this they pronounce to be \u2018valuable\u2019 (for so I suppose we may translate it); and on the other hand that which is the contrary of the former they term \u2018valueless.\u2019 The initial principle being thus established that things in accordance with nature are \u2018things to be taken\u2019 for their own sake, and their opposites similarly \u2018things to be rejected,\u2019 the first \u2018appropriate act\u2019 (for so I render the Greek kathekon) is to preserve oneself in one\u2019s natural constitution; the next is to retain those things which are in accordance with nature and to repel those that are contrary; then when this principle of choice and also of rejection has been discovered, there follows next in order choice conditioned by \u2018appropriate action\u2019; then such choice become a fixed habit; and finally, choice fully rationalized and in harmony with nature.","Wherefore, if this consideration moves any one, that it has been heard that some tool of Lentulus is running about the shops,\u2014is hoping that the minds of some poor and ignorant men may be corrupted by bribery; that, indeed, has been attempted and begun, but no one has been found either so wretched in their fortune or so abandoned in their inclination as not to wish the place of their seat and work and daily gain, their chamber and their bed, and, in short, the tranquil course of their lives, to be still preserved to them. And far the greater part of those who are in the shops,\u2014yes, indeed, (for that is the more correct way of speaking,) the whole of this class is of all the most attached to tranquillity; their whole stock, indeed, their whole employment and livelihood, exists by the peaceful intercourse of the citizens, and is wholly supported by peace. And if their gains are diminished whenever their shops are shut, what will they be when they are burnt?","Although in one point the circumstances of foreign triumph are better than those of domestic victory; because foreign enemies, either if they be crushed become one\'s servants, or if they be received into the state, think themselves bound to us by obligations; but those of the number of citizens who become depraved by madness and once begin to be enemies to their country,\u2014those men, when you have defeated their attempts to injure the republic, you can neither restrain by force nor conciliate by kindness.","Socrates used to pronounce a curse upon those who first drew a conceptual distinction between things naturally inseparable.","Dac\u0103 ai o gr\u0103din\u0103 \u0219i o bibliotec\u0103, ai tot ce-\u021bi trebuie.","the man to open his ears widest to flatterers is he who first flatters himself and is fondest of himself.","Osons non seulement couper les branches de nos malheurs, mais arracher tous les filaments de leurs racines. Peut-\xeatre pourtant en restera-t-il quelque chose, tellement sont profondes les souches de la d\xe9raison ; mais il ne restera que le n\xe9cessaire. Ainsi tiens pour certains que, si l\'\xe2me ne gu\xe9rit pas (ce qui est impossible sans la philosophie), il n\'y aura pas de fins \xe0 nos mis\xe8res.

Es cierto que los plebeyos de Roma son como animales, pero son muchos y necesitamos sus votos para alcanzar el poder. Que la clase media nos sirva hasta el final, porque los nuevos ciudadanos no piensan mas que en trabajo.","The man who has a garden and a library has everything.","In omni disciplina informa est artis praeceptio sine summa assiduitate exercitationis.","However one defines man, the same definition applies to us all.","Solo un loco bailar\xeda estando sobrio.","What he sees often, he does not wonder at, even if he does not know why it is. If something happens which he has not seen before, he thinks it a prodigy.","Sapientia autem est, ut a veteribus philosophis definitum est, rerum divinarum et humanarum causarumque, quibus eae res continentur, scientia, cuius studium qui vituperat haud sane intellego quidnam sit quod laudandum putet.","it is by no means surprising that though we are first commended to Wisdom by the primary natural instincts, afterwards Wisdom itself becomes dearer to us than are the instincts from which we came to her.","Die Menschen kommen durch nichts den G\xf6ttern n\xe4her, als wenn sie Menschen gl\xfccklich machen.","sed inter hominem et beluam ho maxime interest, quod haec tantum, quantum sensu movetur, ad id solum, quod adest quodque prasens est, se accommodat paulum admodum sentiens praeteritum aut futurum; homo autem, quod rationis est particeps, per quam consequentia cernit, causas rerum videt earumque praegressus et quasi antecessiones non ignorat, similitudines comparat rebusque praesentibus adjungit atque annectit futuras, facile totius vitae cursum videt ad eamque degendam praeparat res necessarias.","Optime autem societas hominum conjunctioque servabitur, si, ut quisque erit conjunctissimus, ita in eum benignitatis plurimum conferetur.
