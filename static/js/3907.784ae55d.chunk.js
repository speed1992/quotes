They will be stumbling blocks or stepping stones; it all depends on how you use them.","There are two different types of people in the world, those who want to know, and those who want to believe.","And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.","Nobody is more inferior than those who insist on being equal.","In the dark, time feels different than when it is light.","To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.","You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.","Enjoy life. This is not a dress rehearsal.","I\'m not upset that you lied to me, I\'m upset that from now on I can\'t believe you.","Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.","Do you want to have an easy life? Then always stay with the herd and lose yourself in the herd.","There\'s no defense against stupidity.","No price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.","Insanity in individuals is something rare - but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.","Everything the State says is a lie, and everything it has it has stolen.","Man is the only animal that must be encouraged to live.","In the mountains of truth, you never climb in vain.","Men who think deeply appear to be comedians in their dealings with others because they always have to feign superficiality in order to be understood.","My solitude doesn\u2019t depend on the presence or absence of people; on the contrary, I hate who steals my solitude without, in exchange, offering me true company.","One can promise actions, but not feelings, for the latter are involuntary. He who promises to love forever or hate forever or be forever faithful to someone is promising something that is not in his power.","It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.","Everything matters. Nothing\'s important.","There are no facts, only interpretations.","The higher we soar the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly.","The snake which cannot cast its skin has to die. As well the minds which are prevented from changing their opinions; they cease to be mind.","When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is usually something wrong with her sexuality.","Become who you are.

For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.","Young people love what is interesting and odd, no matter how true or false it is. More mature minds love what is interesting and odd about truth. Fully mature intellects, finally, love truth, even when it appears plain and simple, boring to the ordinary person; for they have noticed that truth tends to reveal its highest wisdom in the guise of simplicity.","He who cannot obey himself will be commanded. That is the nature of living creatures.","The Great Man... is colder, harder, less hesitating, and without fear of \'opinion\'; he lacks the virtues that accompany respect and \'respectability,\' and altogether everything that is the \'virtue of the herd.\' If he cannot lead, he goes alone... He knows he is incommunicable: he finds it tasteless to be familiar... When not speaking to himself, he wears a mask. There is a solitude within him that is inaccessible to praise or blame.","You know a moment is important when it is making your mind go numb with beauty.","I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses.","Solitude makes us tougher towards ourselves and tenderer towards others. In both ways it improves our character.","Love your enemies because they bring out the best in you.","The most spiritual men, as the strongest, find their happiness where others would find their destruction: in the labyrinth, in hardness against themselves and others, in experiments. Their joy is self-conquest: asceticism becomes in them nature, need, and instinct. Difficult tasks are a privilege to them; to play with burdens that crush others, a recreation. Knowledge-a form of asceticism. They are the most venerable kind of man: that does not preclude their being the most cheerful and the kindliest.","The world is beautiful, but has a disease called man.","That which does not kill us makes us stronger.","Call me whatever you like; I am who I must be.","In loneliness, the lonely one eats himself; in a crowd, the many eat him.

There are, to be sure, countless paths and bridges and demi-gods which would carry you across this river; but only at the cost of yourself; you would pawn yourself and lose.

Lonely one, you are going the way to yourself! And your way goes past yourself, and past your seven devils! You will be a heretic to yourself and witch and soothsayer and fool and doubter and unholy one and villain. You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame: how could you become new, if you had not first become ashes?","One must learn to love oneself with a wholesome and healthy love, so that one can bear to be with oneself and need not roam.","We have art so that we shall not die of reality.","There are horrible people who, instead of solving a problem, tangle it up and make it harder to solve for anyone who wants to deal with it. Whoever does not know how to hit the nail on the head should be asked not to hit it at all.","Is it better to out-monster the monster or to be quietly devoured?","And once you are awake, you shall remain awake eternally.","Invisible threads are the strongest ties.","I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and the impossible.","What is the truth, but a lie agreed upon.","But it is the same with man as with the tree. The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and deep \u2014 into the evil.","All truly great thoughts are conceived by walking.","If the all powerful god controls satan he is an accomplice, and if he doesn\'t, he is not an all powerful god.","I and me are always too deeply in conversation.","The demand to be loved is the greatest of all arrogant presumptions.","All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.","People who live in an age of corruption are witty and slanderous; they know that there are other kinds of murder than by dagger or assault; they also know that whatever is well said is believed.","There are no beautiful surfaces without a terrible depth.","He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.","To learn to see- to accustom the eye to calmness, to patience, and to allow things to come up to it; to defer judgment, and to acquire the habit of approaching and grasping an individual case from all sides. This is the first preparatory schooling of intellectuality. One must not respond immediately to a stimulus; one must acquire a command of the obstructing and isolating instincts.","If you know the why, you can live any how.","People are always angry at anyone who chooses very individual standards for his life; because of the extraordinary treatment which that man grants to himself, they feel degraded, like ordinary beings.","But he who is hated by the people, as the wolf by the dogs - is the free spirit, the enemy of fetters, the non-adorer, the dweller in the woods.","What is wrong with Christianity is that it refrains from doing all those things that Christ commanded should be done.","When you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.","Do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can assume great men of all kinds who were very little gifted. They acquired greatness, became \u201cgeniuses\u201d (as we put it), through qualities the lack of which no one who knew what they were would boast of: they all possessed that seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; they allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole.","Few are made for independence, it is the privilege of the strong.","Life is the will to power; our natural desire to dominate and reshape the world to fit our own preferences and assert our personal strength to the fullest degree.","The purpose of criminal law is to punish the enemies of those in power.","What is the task of higher education? To make a man into a machine. What are the means employed? He is taught how to suffer being bored.","It is nobler to declare oneself wrong than to insist on being right --especially when one is right.","I cannot believe in a God who wants to be praised all the time.","No journey is too great,\\n when one finds what one seeks.","In heaven, all the interesting people are missing.","Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood.","Liberal institutions straightway cease being liberal the moment they are soundly established: Once this is attained, no more grievous and more thorough enemies of freedom exist than liberal institutions.","One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.","In revenge and in love, woman is more barbarous than man.","I have found strength where one does not look for it: in simple, mild, and pleasant people, without the least desire to rule -- and, conversely, the desire to rule has often appeared to me a sign of inward weakness: they fear their own slave soul and shroud it in a royal cloak (in the end, they still become the slaves of their followers, their fame, etc.)","There is an old illusion. It is called good and evil.","The discipline of suffering, of great suffering- do you not know that only this discipline has created all enhancements of man so far? That tension of the soul in unhappiness which cultivates its strength, its shudders face to face with great ruin, its inventiveness and courage in enduring, preserving, interpreting, and exploiting suffering, and whatever has been granted to it of profundity, secret, mask, spirit, cunning, greatness- was it not granted to it through suffering, through the discipline of great suffering?","Every man has his price. This is not true. But for every man there exists a bait which he cannot resist swallowing. To win over certain people to something, it is only necessary to give it a gloss of love of humanity, nobility, gentleness, self-sacrifice - and there is nothing you cannot get them to swallow. To their souls, these are the icing, the tidbit; other kinds of souls have others.","Today as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself, is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official, or a scholar.","The \'kingdom of God\' is not something one waits for; it has no yesterday or tomorrow, it does not come \'in a thousand years\' it is an experience within a heart; it is everywhere, it is nowhere.","We labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life because it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think. Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.","The most intelligent men, like the strongest, find their happiness where others would find only disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with others, in effort; their delight is self-mastery; in them asceticism becomes second nature, a necessity, as instinct.","Who is better, they who promote truth over happiness, or happiness over truth?","One must be a sea, to receive a polluted stream without becoming impure.","The most perfidious way of harming a cause consists of defending it deliberately with faulty arguments.","Freedom is the will to be responsible for ourselves. It is to preserve the distance which separates us from other men. To grow more indifferent to hardship, to severity, to privation, and even to life itself.","What destroys a man more quickly than to work, think and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasure - as a mere automaton of duty?","Without music, life would be a mistake.","In every real man a child is hidden that wants to play.","Ultimately, it is the desire, not the desired, that we love.","No artist tolerates reality.","I go in solitude, so as not to drink out of everybody\'s cistern. When I am among the many I live as the many do, and I do not think I really think; after a time it always seems as if they want to banish myself from myself and rob me of my soul.","Socialism is the phantastic younger brother of despotism, which it wants to inherit. Socialism wants to have the fullness of state force which before only existed in despotism. ... However, it goes further than anything in the past because it aims at the formal destruction of the individual ... who ... can be used to improve communities by an expedient organ of government.","We often refuse to accept an idea merely because the tone of voice in which it has been expressed is unsympathetic to us.","Creating-that is the great salvation from suffering.","We are all afraid of the truth.","A thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions--as attempts to find out something. Success and failure are for him answers above all.","Man\'s task is simple. He should cease letting his existence be a thoughtless accident.","We seldom break our leg so long as life continues a toilsome upward climb. The danger comes when we begin to take things easily and choose the convenient paths.","The strong individual loves the earth so much he lusts for recurrence. He can smile in the face of the most terrible thought: meaningless, aimless existence recurring eternally. The second characteristic of such a man is that he has the strength to recognize - and to live with the recognition - that the world is valueless in itself and that all values are human ones. He creates himself by fashioning his own values; he has the pride to live by the values he wills.","We are so fond of being out among nature, because it has no opinions about us.","The best weapon against an enemy is another enemy.","The deeper minds of all ages have had pity for animals.","I overcame myself, the sufferer; I carried my own ashes to the mountains; I invented a brighter flame for myself.","The secret of reaping the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment from life is to live dangerously.","He who obeys, does not listen to himself!","Sit as little as possible. Give no credence to any thought that \\n was not born outdoors while moving about freely.","the voice of beauty speaks softly; it creeps only into the most fully awakened souls","Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one.","Morality is neither rational nor absolute nor natural. World has known many moral systems, each of which advances claims universality; all moral systems are therefore particular, serving a specific purpose for their propagators or creators, and enforcing a certain regime that disciplines human beings for social life by narrowing our perspectives and limiting our horizons.","A moral system valid for all is basically immoral.","There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.","Everything in the world displeases me: but, above all, my displeasure in everything displeases me.","Madness is not a consequence of uncertainty but of certainty.","If you want me to believe in your redeemer, you are going to have to look a lot more redeemed.","In truth,there was only one christian and he died on the cross.","One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people.","Faith: not wanting to know what is true.","To one who is accustomed to thinking a lot, every new thought that he hears or reads about immediately appears as a link in a chain.","Extreme positions are not succeeded by moderate ones but by extreme positions of the opposite kind.","A woman may very well form a friendship with a man, but for this to endure, it must be assisted by a little physical antipathy.","The man who does not wish to be one of the mass only needs to cease to be easy on himself.","Those who cannot understand how to put their thoughts on ice should not enter into the heat of debate.","Fear is the mother of morality.","I am alone again and I want to be so; alone with the pure sky and open sea.","You lack the courage to be consumed in flames and to become ashes: so you will never become new, and never young again!","Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.Courageous, untroubled, mocking and violent-that is what Wisdom wants us to be. Wisdom is a woman, and loves only a warrior.","One should die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly.","Original minds are not distinguished by being the first to see a new thing, but instead by seeing the old, familiar thing that is over-looked as something new.","For this remains as I have already pointed out the essential difference between the two religions of decadence : Buddhism promises nothing, but actually fulfils; Christianity promises everything, but fulfils nothing.","Untroubled, scornful, outrageous - that is how wisdom wants us to be: she is a woman and never loves anyone but a warrior.","The love of power is the demon of mankind.","There is not enough love and goodness in the world to permit giving any of it away to imaginary beings.","Those who are devoid of purpose will make the void their purpose.","What is evil?-Whatever springs from weakness.","Beware of spitting against the wind!","The real world is much smaller than the imaginary","A thought, even a possibility, can shatter and transform us.","What someone is, begins to be revealed when his talent abates, when he stops showing us what he can do.","An attack on the roots of passion means an attack on the roots of life.","What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: \'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more\' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: \'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.","Thoughts are the shadows of our feelings - always darker, emptier and simpler.","...lust is only a sweet poison for the weakling, but for those who will with a lion\'s heart it is the reverently reserved wine of wines.","After coming into contact with a religious man I always feel I must wash my hands.","If an architect wants to strengthen a decrepit arch, he increases the load laid upon it, for thereby the parts are joined more firmly together.","But thus I counsel you, my friends: Mistrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful. They are people of a low sort and stock; the hangmen and the bloodhound look out of their faces. Mistrust all who talk much of their justice! Verily, their souls lack more than honey. And when they call themselves the good and the just, do not forget that they would be pharisees, if only they had-power.","The \'kingdom of Heaven\' is a condition of the heart - not something that comes \'upon the earth\' or \'after death.\'","Is life not a thousand times too short for us to bore ourselves?","A very popular error: having the courage of one\'s convictions; rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack on one\'s convictions.","Morality is the herd-instinct in the individual.","Most people are too stupid to act in their own interest","When self control is lacking in small things, the ability to apply it to matters of importance withers away. Every day in which one does not at least deny himself some trifle is badly spent and a threat to the day following.","Man, a hybrid of plant and ghost.","Convictions are more dangerous foes of truth than lies.","Every achievement, every step forward in knowledge, is the consequence of courage, of toughness towards oneself, of sincerity to oneself","The best friend will probably acquire the best wife, because a good marriage is founded on the talent for friendship.","Mediocrity is the most effective mask a superior spirit can wear, because to the great majority, which is to say, to the mediocre,it will not suggest a disguise:--and yet it is precisely for their sake that he puts it on--so as not to arouse them, and, indeed, not infrequently to avoid this out of pity and benevolence.","What we do is never understood, but always merely praised or blamed.","Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man.","The free man is a warrior.","You must climb above yourself-up and beyond, until you have even your stars under you.","What is the seal of liberation? Not to be ashamed in front of oneself.","Our salvation lies not in knowing, but in creating!","The growth of wisdom may be gauged exactly by the diminution of ill-temper.","\\"Belief in the truth commences with the doubting of all those \\"truths\\" we once believed.\\"","There is one thing one has to have either a soul that is cheerful by nature, or a soul made cheerful by work, love, art, and knowledge.","Men should learn to live with the same seriousness with which children play.","No one is such a liar as the indignant man.","To the mediocre, mediocrity is a form of happiness.","If you are too weak to give yourselves your own law, then a tyrant shall lay his yoke upon you and say: \\"Obey! Clench your teeth and obey!\\" And all good and evil shall be drowned in obedience to him.","Success has always been a great liar.","The greatest cure for love is still that time honoured medicine - love returned.","For what purpose humanity is there should not even concern us: why you are here, that you should ask yourself: and if you have no ready answer, then set for yourself goals, high and noble goals, and perish in pursuit of them!","Amor Fati \u2013 \u201cLove Your Fate\u201d, which is in fact your life.","Deception, flattering, lying, deluding, talking behind the back, putting up a false front, living in borrowed splendor, wearing a mask, hiding behind convention, playing a role for others and for oneself -- in short, a continuous fluttering around the solitary flame of vanity -- is so much the rule and the law among men that there is almost nothing which is less comprehensible than how an honest and pure drive for truth could have arisen among them.","What convinces is not necessarily true-it is merely convincing: a note for asses.","Perhaps I know best why it is man alone who laughs; he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter.","Shared joys make a friend, not shared sufferings.","Many are stubborn in pursuit of the path they have chosen, few in pursuit of the goal.","All I need is a sheet of paper and something to write with, and then I can turn the world upside down.","At the beginning of a marriage ask yourself whether this woman will be interesting to talk to from now until old age. Everything else in marriage is transitory: most of the time is spent in conversation.","Marriage was contrived for ordinary people, for people who are capable of neither great love nor great friendship, which is to say, for most people--but also for those exceptionally rare ones who are capable of love as well as of friendship.","One man runs to his neighbor because he is looking for himself, and another because he wants to loose himself. Your bad love of yourselves makes solitude a prison for you.","...throw roses into the abyss and say: \'here is my thanks to the monster who didn\'t succeed in swallowing me alive.","My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it\u2014all idealism is mendaciousness in the face of what is necessary\u2014but love it","Become who you are!","I hate who steals my solitude, without really offer me in exchange company.","Examine the life of the best and most productive men and nations, and ask yourselves whether a tree which is to grow proudly skywards can dispense with bad weather and storms. Whether misfortune and opposition, or every kind of hatred, jealousy, stubbornness, distrust, severity, greed, and violence do not belong to the favourable conditions without which a great growth even of virtue is hardly possible?","Forgetting: that is a divine capacity. And whoever aspires to the heights and wants to fly must cast off much that is heavy and make himself light--I call it a divine capacity for lightness.","From passions grow opinions; intellectual laziness lets these harden into convictions.","Your soul will be dead even before your body: fear nothing further.","Consider the cattle, grazing as they pass you by. They do not know what is meant by yesterday or today, they leap about, eat, rest, digest, leap about again, and so from morn till night and from day to day, fettered to the moment and its pleasure or displeasure, and thus neither melancholy nor bored. [...] A human being may well ask an animal: \'Why do you not speak to me of your happiness but only stand and gaze at me?\' The animal would like to answer, and say, \'The reason is I always forget what I was going to say\' - but then he forgot this answer too, and stayed silent.","Death is close enough at hand so we do not need to be afraid of life.","If one seeks relief from unbearable pressure, one is to eat hashish.","The more you let yourself go, the less others let you go.","We must learn to love, learn to be kind, and this from the earliest youth; if education or chance give us no opportunity to practice these feelings, our soul becomes dry and unsuited even to understanding the tender inventions of loving people.","He who cannot give anything away cannot feel anything either.","Follow in the footsteps of your fathers\' virtue! How could you hope to climb high unless your fathers\' will climbs with you?","We love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving.","Morality is the best of all devices for leading mankind by the nose.","To live alone one must be a beast or a god, says Aristotle. Leaving out the third case: one must be both - a philosopher.","I climb upon the highest mountains, laughing at all tragedies - whether real or imaginary.","The higher man is distinguished from the lower by his fearlessness and his readiness to challenge misfortune.","When a hundred men stand together, each of them loses his mind and gets another one.","Everyone needs a sense of shame, but no one needs to feel ashamed.","We do not belong to those who only get their thought from books, or at the prompting of books, -- it is our custom to think in the open air, walking, leaping, climbing, or dancing on lonesome mountains by preference, or close to the sea, where even the paths become thoughtful.","All great men are play actors of their own ideal.","That the world is not the embodiment of an eternal rationality can be conclusively proved by the fact that the piece of the worldthat we know--I mean our human reason--is not so very rational. And if it is not eternally and completely wise and rational, then the rest of the world will not be either; here the conclusion a minori ad majus, a parte ad totum applies, and does so with decisive force.","You cannot learn to fly by flying. First you must learn to walk, to run, to climb, to dance.","It is difficult to live among people because silence is so difficult.","The most instructive experiences are those of everyday life.","Most thinkers write badly, because they communicate not only their thoughts, but also the thinking of them.","Life is that which must overcome itself again and again","I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.","One must separate from anything that forces one to repeat No again and again.","You say \'I\' and you are proud of this word. But greater than this- although you will not believe in it - is your body and its great intelligence, which does not say \'I\' but performs \'I\'.","What we call truths are just those errors that we cannot give up.","It is within your power to see that all you have experienced, trials, errors, faults, deceptions, passions, your love and your hope, shall be merged wholly in your aim.","The moral earth, too, is round! The moral earth, too, has its antipodes! The antipodes, too, have their right to exist! There is still another world to be discovered--and more than one! Set sail, you philosophers!","I love him who wants to create over and beyond himself and thus perishes.","Those you cannot teach to fly, teach to fall faster.","That which needs to be proved cannot be worth much.","Precisely the least, the softest, lightest, a lizard\'s rustling, a breath, a flash, a moment - a little makes the way of the best happiness.","Did you ever say yes to a pleasure? oh my friends, then you also said yes to all pain. all things are linked, entwined, in love with one another.","Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach honesty.","Without passions you have no experience whatever.","I know my fate. One day my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous \u2014 a crisis without equal on earth, the most profound collision of conscience, a decision that was conjured up against everything that had been believed, demanded, hallowed so far. I am no man, I am dynamite.","What makes us heroic?--Confronting simultaneously our supreme suffering and our supreme hope.","The visionary lies to himself, the liar only to others.","If you buy the why, the how is infinitely bearable","Remorse.-- Never yield to remorse, but at once tell yourself: remorse would simply mean adding to the first act of stupidity a second.","Profundity of thought belongs to youth, clarity of thought to old age.","But this people has deliberately made itself stupid, for nearly a millennium: nowhere have the two great European narcotics, alcohol and Christianity, been abused more dissolutely.","Those things for which we find words, are things we have already overcome.","Here the ways of men divide. If you wish to strive for peace of soul and happiness, then believe; if you wish to be a disciple of truth, then inquire.","if a person wishes to achieve peace of mind and happiness then they should acquire faith, but if they want to be a disciple of truth, which can be \\"frightening and ugly,\u201d then they need to search.","Everything goes, everything comes back; eternally rolls the wheel of being. Everything dies, everything blossoms again; eternally runs the year of being. Everything breaks, everything is joined anew; eternally the same House of Being is built. Everything parts, everything greets every other thing again; eternally the ring of being remains faithful to itself. In every Now, being begins; round every Here rolls the sphere There. The center is everywhere. Bent is the path of eternity.","What is bad? -Everything that arises from weakness.","Only idiots fail to contradict themselves three times a day.","One should not wish to enjoy where one does not give joy.","I love the great despisers because they are the great adorers.","Every true faith is infallible. It performs what the believing person hopes to find in it. But it does not offer the least support for the establishing of an objective truth. Here the ways of men divide. If you want to achieve peace of mind and happiness, have faith. If you want to be a disciple of truth, then search.","It is not when truth is dirty, but when it is shallow, that the lover of knowledge is reluctant to step into its waters.","We should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once.","What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself. What is bad? All that is born of weakness. What is happiness? The feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome.","The man loves danger and sport. That is why he loves woman, the most dangerous of all sports.","Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes.","I know the hatred and envy of your hearts. Ye are not great enough not to know of hatred and envy. Then be great enough not to be ashamed of them!","He who cannot command himself should obey. And many can command themselves, but much is still lacking before they can obey themselves.",". . . an absurd problem came to the surface: \'How COULD God permit that (crucifixion of Jesus Christ)!\' . . . the deranged reason of the little community found quite a frightfully absurd answer: God gave his Son for forgiveness, as a SACRIFICE . . . The SACRIFICE FOR GUILT, and just in its most repugnant and barbarous form - the sacrifice of the innocent for the sins of the guilty! What horrifying heathenism!","I call a lie: wanting not to see something one does see, wanting not to see something as one sees it... The most common lie is the lie one tells to oneself; lying to others is relatively the exception.","This is the hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love, and keep modest as a giver.","Belief in truth begins with doubting all that has hitherto been believed to be true.","If virtue goes to sleep, it will be more vigorous when it awakes.","I hate you most because you attract, but are not strong enough to pull me to you.","The discipline of suffering, of great suffering - do you not know that it is this discipline alone that has produced all the elevations of humanity so far?","Everyone carries within himself an image of womanliness derived from his mother: it is this that determines whether, on the whole,he will revere women, or despise them, or remain generally indifferent to them.","My genius is in my nostrils.","Glance into the world just as though time were gone: and everything crooked will become straight to you.","We do not hate as long as we still attach a lesser value, but only when we attach an equal or a greater value.","Some men are born posthumously.","What is bad?

So far as superior truth is concerned, it is enough to observe that the awakening sciences have allied themselves point by point with the philosophy of Epicurus, but point by point rejected Christianity.","The belief in authority is the source of conscience; which is therefore not the voice of God in the heart of man, but the voice of some men in man.","The truth is ugly: we have art so as not to perish from the truth.","Just as a waterfall grows slower and more lightly suspended as it plunges down, so the great man of action tends to act with greater calmness than his tempestuous desires prior to the deed would lead one to expect.","To forget one\'s purpose is the commonest form of stupidity.","Only great pain is, as the teacher of great suspicion, the ultimate liberator of the spirit...I doubt whether such pain improves us-but I do know it deepens us.","A certain sense of cruelty towards oneself and others is Christian; hatred of those who think differently; the will to persecute. Mortal hostility against the masters of the earth, against the \'noble\', that is also Christian; hatred of mind, of pride, courage, freedom, libertinage of mind, is Christian; hatred of the senses, of joy in general, is Christian.","One repays a teacher badly if one always remains nothing but a pupil.","It is a self-deception of philosophers and moralists to imagine that they escape decadence by opposing it. That is beyond their will; and, however little they acknowledge it, one later discovers that they were among the most powerful promoters of decadence.","Whenever I climb I am followed by a dog called \'Ego\'.","Art is the highest task and the proper metaphysical activity of this life.","The value of a thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays for it - what it costs us","Pitch-black winter nights live in my bones.","A man far oftener appears to have a decided character from persistently following his temperament than from persistently following his principles.","Poets are shameless with their experiences: they exploit them.","Happiness is a fata morgana. the only way to not end up unhappy is to not long for happiness.","Ah, women.

But it can put mountains where there are none.","The future influences the present just as much as the past.","The earth has a skin and that skin has diseases; one of its diseases is called man.","Never to talk about oneself is a very refined form of hypocrisy.","He who does not desire much more from things than knowledge of them easily makes peace with his soul.","There is no more dreary or more repulsive creature than the man who has evaded his genius.","When one has finished building one\'s house, one suddenly realizes that in the process one has learned something that one really needed to know in the worst way - before one began.","I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, and the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough - I call it the one immortal blemish on the human race.","To have and to want more that is life.","Buddha says: \\"Do not flatter your benefactor!\\".

God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us?

Or are there epidemics of health?","The spiritual activity of millennia is deposited in language.","Men were considered \\"free\\" only so that they might be considered guilty - could be judged and punished: consequently, every act had to be considered as willed, and the origin of every act had to be considered as lying within the consciousness (and thus the most fundamental psychological deception was made the principle of psychology itself).","I see many soldiers; could I but see many warriors! \\"Uniform\\" one calleth what they wear; may it not be uniform what they therewith hide!","Rejoicing in our joy, not suffering over our suffering, makes someone a friend.","It is the privilege of greatness to confer intense happiness with insignificant gifts.","The lonely one offers his hand too quickly to whomever he encounters.","I am driven out of fatherlands and motherlands. Thus I now love only my children\'s land, yet undiscovered, in the farthest sea; for this I bid my sails search and search.","In all institutions from which the cold wind of open criticism is excluded, an innocent corruption begins to grow like a mushroom - for example, in senates and learned societies","The task is not to overcome opponents in general but only those opponents against whom one has to summon all one\'s strength, one\'s skill and one\'s swordsmanship-in fact to master opponents who are one\'s equals.","The poison by which the weaker nature is destroyed is strengthening to the strong individual and he does not call it poison.","What was silent in the father speaks in the son, and often I found in the son the unveiled secret of the father.","Life is an instinct for growth, for survival, for the accumulation of forces, for power.","Talking much about oneself may be a way of hiding oneself.","My conception of freedom. \u2014 The value of a thing sometimes does not lie in that which one attains by it, but in what one pays for it \u2014 what it costs us. Liberal institutions cease to be liberal as soon as they are attained: later on, there are no worse and no more thorough injurers of freedom than liberal institutions.","Let us not underestimate the privileges of the mediocre. As one climbs higher, life becomes ever harder, the coldness increases, responsibility increases.","The thousand mysteries around us would not trouble but interest us, if only we had cheerful, healthy hearts.","Thinking has to be learned in the way dancing has to be learned.","To see others suffer does one good, to make others suffer even more: this is a hard saying but an ancient, mighty, human, all-too-human principle [....] Without cruelty there is no festival.","The mother of excess is not joy but joylessness.","Your only problem, perhaps, is that you scream without letting yourself cry.","All isolation is wrong so say the herd. And long didst thou belong to the herd.","It is far pleasanter to injure and afterwards beg forgiveness than to be injured and grant forgiveness. He who does the former gives evidence of power and afterwards of kindness of character.","Christianity was from the beginning, essentially and fundamentally, life\'s nausea and disgust with life, merely concealed behind, masked by, dressed up as, faith in \\"another\\" or \\"better\\" life.","To become wise you have to want to experience certain experiences, and so to run into their open jaws. This is very dangerous, tobe sure; many a \\"wise man\\" has been eaten up in doing so.","The living is a species of the dead; and not a very attractive one.","Some people appear to be more meager in talent than they are, just because the tasks they set themselves are always too great.","We hear only those questions for which we are in a position to find answers.","A thought comes when it will, not when I will.","The Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation.","The word \'Christianity\' is already a misunderstanding - in reality there has been only one Christian, and he died on the Cross.","Man and man\'s earth are unexhausted and undiscovered. Wake and listen! Verily, the earth shall yet be a source of recovery. Remain faithful to the earth, with the power of your virtue. Let your gift-giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the earth.","What do you plan to do in the land of the sleepers? You have been floating in a sea of solitude, and the sea has borne you up. At long last, are you ready for dry land? Are you ready to drag yourself ashore?","In solitude there grows what anyone brings into it, the inner beast too. Therefore solitude is inadvisable to many.","Every man has his price. This is not true. But for every man there exists a bait which he cannot resist swallowing.","Man is the cruelest animal.","Anything which is a living and not a dying body... will have to be an incarnate will to power, it will strive to grow, spread, seize, become predominant - not from any morality or immorality but because it is living and because life simply is will to power... \'Exploitation\'... belongs to the essence of what lives, as a basic organic function; it is a consequence of the will to power, which is after all the will to life.","Giving style\u201d to one\u2019s character - a great and rare art! It is exercised by those who see all the strengths and weaknesses of their own natures and then comprehend them in an artistic plan until everything appears as art and reason and even weakness delights the eye.","We operate with nothing but things which do not exist, with lines, planes, bodies, atoms, divisible time, divisible space - how should explanation even be possible when we first make everything into an image, into our own image!","Love is a state in which a man sees things most decidedly as they are not.","It is very noble hypocrisy not to talk of one\'s self.","It is an end with priests and gods, if man becomes scientific. Moral: science is the thing forbidden in itself - it alone is forbidden. Science is the first sin, the germ of all sin, original sin.

We hold-back from telling them everything we think, often because we do not genuinely mean what we say; or because we take a pleasure in their plight, thankful that we are not affected.","Science is about finding ever better approximations rather than pretending you have already found ultimate truth.\\nA casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything.","Let us beware of saying there are laws in nature. There are only necessities: there is no one to command, no one to obey, no one to transgress. When you realize there are no goals or objectives, then you realize, too, that there is no chance: for only in a world of objectives does the word chance have any meaning.","Error has made man so deep, sensitive, and inventive that he has put forth such blossoms as religions and arts. Pure knowledge could not have been capable of it.","We find nothing easier than being wise, patient, superior. We drip with the oil of forbearance and sympathy, we are absurdly just, we forgive everything. For that very reason we ought to discipline ourselves a little; for that very reason we ought to cultivate a little emotion, a little emotional vice, from time to time. It may be hard for us; and among ourselves we may perhaps laugh at the appearance we thus present. But what of that! We no longer have any other mode of self-overcoming available to us: this is our asceticism, our penance.","The vain.- We are like shop windows in which we are continually arranging, concealing or illuminating the supposed qualities other ascribe to us - in order to deceive ourselves.","To be ashamed of one\'s immorality: that is a step on the staircase at whose end one is also ashamed of one\'s morality.","Beware in the presence of cats: they never give, they do not even retaliate--they only reply, and purr in doing so.","There will be but few people who, when at a loss for topics of conversation, will not reveal the more secret affairs of their friends.","Love is blind, friends close their eyes","When our brain feels too weak to deal with our opponent\'s objections, our heart answers by casting suspicion on their underlying motives.","You gave him an opportunity of showing greatness of character and he did not seize it. He will never forgive you for that.","Those are my enemies: they want to overthrow and to construct nothing themselves. They say: \\"All that is worthless\\"--and want to create no value themselves.","Madness is the result not of uncertainty but certainty.","What, then is truth?... Truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are.","The good-they cannot create; they are always the beginning of the end.","We forget our guilt when we have confessed it to another, but the other does not usually forget it.","What really raises one\'s indignation against suffering is not suffering intrinsically, but the senselessness of suffering","You call yourself free? I want to hear your ruling thought and not that you have escaped a yoke. Are you such a one as was permitted to escape a yoke? There are some who threw away their ultimate worth when they threw away their servitude. Free from what? What is that to Zarathustra! But your eyes should announce to me brightly: free for what?","Man is very well defended against himself... The actual fortress is inaccessible, even invisible to him, unless his friends and enemies play the traitor and conduct him in by a secret path.","A small revenge is more human than no revenge at all.","A strong and well-constituted man digests his experiences (deeds and misdeeds all included) just as he digests his meats, even when he has some tough morsels to swallow.","One must shed the bad taste of wanting to agree with many. \\"Good\\" is no longer good when one\'s neighbor mouths it. And how should there be a \\"common good\\"! The term contradicts itself: whatever can be common always has little value. In the end it must be as it is and always has been: great things remain for the great, abysses for the profound, nuances and shudders for the refined, and, in brief, all that is rare for the rare.","Real dancers are the ones who can hear the music in their soul.","It was Christianity, with its heartfelt resentment against life, that first made something unclean of sexuality: it threw filth on the origin, on the essential fact of our life.","Discontent is the seed of ethics.","A change of values - that means, a change of the creators of values. He who has to be a creator always has to destroy.","Egoism is the very essence of a noble soul.","I am not a human being, I am dynamite.","Pity is the most agreeable feeling among those who have little pride and no prospects of great conquests.","People who feel insecure in social situations never miss a chance to exhibit their dominance over close, submissive friends, whomthey put down publicly, in front of everyone--by teasing, for example.","Out of damp and gloomy days, out of solitude, out of loveless words directed at us, conclusions grow up in us like fungus: one morning they are there, we know not how, and they gaze upon us, morose and gray. Woe to the thinker who is not the gardener but only the soil of the plants that grow in him.","For art to exist, for any sort of aesthetic activity to exist, a certain physiological precondition is indispensable: intoxication.","How poisonous, how crafty, how bad, does every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means of force!","I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage.","Is man merely a mistake of God\'s? Or God merely a mistake of man?","Regarding life, the wisest men of all ages have judged alike: it is worthless.","I have never come across someone who could inspire more respect than the Greek philosophers.","God is a thought who makes crooked all that is straight.","Clever people are never credited with their follies: what a deprivation of human rights!","Everything becomes and recurs eternally - escape is impossible!","Something unappeased, unappeasable, is within me.","The individual has always to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe.","The complete irresponsibility of man for his actions and his nature is the bitterest drop which he who understands must swallow.","Necessity is an interpretation, not a fact.","I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding","He turns all of his injuries into strengths, that which does not kill him makes him stronger, he is superman.","Whatever the State saith is a lie; whatever it hath is a theft: all is counterfeit in it, the gnawing, sanguinary, insatiate monster.","The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.","Reality is captured in the categorical nets of Language only at the expense of fatal distortion.","Danger alone acquaints us with our own resources, our virtues, our armor and weapons, our spirit, and forces us to be strong.","I absolutely cannot see how one can later make up for having failed to go to a good school at the proper time. For this is what distinguishes the hard school as a good school from all others: that much is demanded; and sternly demanded; that the good, even the exceptional, is demanded as the norm; that praise is rare, that indulgence is nonexistent; that blame is apportioned sharply, objectively, without regard for talent or antecedents. What does one learn in a hard school? Obeying and commanding.","Above all, there is no exception to this rule: that the idea of political superiority always resolves itself into the idea of psychological superiority.","Great intellects are skeptical.","Love, too, has to be learned.","In almost all sciences the fundamental knowledge is either found in earliest times or is still being sought.","In the end one only experiences oneself.","Knowledge kills action; action requires the veils of illusion.","I am too inquisitive, too skeptical, too arrogant, to let myself be satisfied with an obvious and crass solution of things. God is such an obvious and crass solution; a solution which is a sheer indelicacy to us thinkers - at bottom He is really nothing but a coarse commandment against us: ye shall not think!","Our faith in others betrays that we would rather have faith in ourselves. Our longing for a friend is our betrayer. And often with our love we want merely to overcome envy. And often we attack and make ourselves enemies, to conceal that we are vulnerable.","Who can attain to anything great if he does not feel in himself the force and will to inflict great pain?","We talk so abstractly about poetry because all of us are usually bad poets.","A man who has depths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach . . .","Only individuals have a sense of responsibility.","Man alone suffers so excruciatingly in the world that he was compelled to invent laughter.","Or shall I go out as a light does, not first blown out by the wind, but grown tired and weary of itself - a burnt out light? Or finally, shall I blow myself out, so as not to burn out?","Why does man not see things? He is himself standing in the way: he conceals things.","The most fundamental form of human stupidity is forgetting what we were trying to do in the first place.","These small things - nutrition, place, climate, recreation, the whole casuistry of selfishness - are inconceivably more important than everything one has taken to be important so far.","A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything.","It is not in how one soul approaches another but in how it withdraws that I knowr its affinity and solidarity with the other.","It takes physical courage to indulge in wickedness. The \\"good\\" are too cowardly to do it.","All truth is simple... is that not doubly a lie?","There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined, or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated","One must need to be strong, otherwise one will never become strong.","For the woman, the man is a means: the end is always the child.","Our shortcomings are the eyes with which we see the ideal.","Mankind must work continually to produce individual great human beings - this and nothing else is the task... for the question is this : How can your life, the individual life, retain the highest value, the deepest significance? Only by living for the good of the rarest and most valuable specimens.","The elimination of the will altogether and the switching off of the emotions all and sundry, is tantamount to the elimination of reason: intellectual castration.","He who speaks a bit of a foreign language has more delight in it than he who speaks it well; pleasure goes along with superficial knowledge.","In Christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point.","Kindliness, friendliness, the courtesy of the heart, are ever-flowing streams of non egoistic impulses, and have given far more powerful assistance to culture than even those much more famous demonstrations which are called pity, mercy, and self-sacrifice.","For as long as they praise you, never forget that it is not yet your own path that you walk, but another person\'s.","Everything in woman hath a solution. It is called pregnancy.","The wreckage of stars - I built a world from this wreckage.","A life without music is an error.","There is not sufficient religion in the world merely to put an end to the number of religions.","A few hours of mountain climbing make a blackguard and a saint two rather similar creatures.","I am a law only for my kind, I am no law for all.","Improvements are invented only by those who can feel that something is not good.","There still shines the most important nuance by virtue of which the noble felt themselves to be men of a higher rank. They designate themselves simply by their superiority in power (as \\"the powerful,\\" \\"the masters,\\" \\"the commanders\\") or by the most clearly visible signs of this superiority, for example, as \\"the rich,\\" \\"the possessors\\" (this is the meaning of \'Arya,\' and of corresponding words in Iranian and Slavic).","It is possible that the production of genius is reserved to a limited period of mankind\'s history.","You look up when you wish to be exalted. And I look down because I am exalted.","Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue. Let your gift-giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the earth. Thus I beg and beseech you. Do not let them fly away from earthly things and beat with their wings against eternal walls. Alas, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away. Lead back to the earth the virtue that flew away, as I do\u2014back to the body, back to life, that it may give the earth a meaning, a human meaning.","Reckoned physiologically, everything ugly weakens and afflicts man. It recalls decay, danger, impotence; he actually suffers a loss of energy in its presence. The effect of the ugly can be measured with a dynamometer. Whenever man feels in any way depressed, he senses the proximity of something ugly. His feeling of power, his will to power, his courage, his pride - they decline with the ugly, they increase with the beautiful.","All mankind is divided, as it was at all times and is still, into slaves and freemen.","The world was conquered through the understanding of dogs; the world exists through the understanding of dogs.","In magnanimity there is the same amount of egoism as in revenge, but egoism of a different quality.","Of all evil I deem you capable: Therefore I want good from you. Verily, I have often laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good because they had no claws.","My idea of paradise is a straight line to goal","The abdomen is the reason why man does not readily take himself to be a god.","Is man one of God\'s blunders? Or is God one of man\'s blunders?","No, life has not disappointed me. On the contrary, I find it truer, more desirable and mysterious every year -- ever since the day when the great liberator came to me: the idea that life could be an experiment of the seeker for knowledge -- and not a duty, not a calamity, not trickery.","If a man wishes to rid himself of a feeling of unbearable oppression, he may have to take hashish.","I conjure you, my brethren, to remain faithful to earth, and do not believe those who speak unto you of super terrestrial hopes! Poisoners they are, whether they know it or not.","On the heights it is warmer than those in the valley imagine.","A belief, however necessary it may be for the preservation of a species, has nothing to do with truth. The falseness of a judgment is not for us necessarily an objection to a judgment. The question is to what extent it is life-promoting, life-preserving, species preserving, perhaps even species cultivating. To recognize untruth as a condition of life--that certainly means resisting accustomed value feelings in a dangerous way; and a philosophy that risks this would by that token alone place itself beyond good and evil.","One ought to hold on to one\'s heart; for if one lets it go, one soon loses control of the head too.","But say, my brothers, what can the child do that even the lion could not do? Why must the preying lion still become a child?  The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a sacred \'Yes.\'  For the game of creation, my brothers, a sacred \'Yes\' is needed: the spirit now wills his own will, and he who had been lost to the world now conquers his own world.","Even the most beautiful scenery is no longer assured of our love after we have lived in it for three months, and some distant coast attracts our avarice: possessions are generally diminished by possession.","One lives for the day, one lives very fast, one lives very irresponsibly: precisely this is called \\"freedom.\\"","The strongest have their moments of fatigue.","You want to make him interested in you? Then pretend to be embarrassed in his presence-","A certain type of person strives to become a master over all, and to extend his force, his will to power, and to subdue all that resists it. But he encounters the power of others, and comes to an arrangement, a union, with those that are like him: thus they work together to serve the will to power. And the process goes on.","Just as bones, tissues, intestines, and blood vessels are enclosed in a skin that makes it possible to bear the sight of a human being, so the agitations and passions of the soul are wrapped up in vanity: it is the soul\'s skin.","The small force that it takes to launch a boat into the stream should not be confused with the force of the stream that carries it along: but this confusion appears in nearly all biographies.","Without music, life would be a mistake... I would only believe in a God who knew how to dance.","Character is determined more by the lack of certain experiences than by those one has had.","Some die too young, some die too old; the precept sounds strange, but die at the right age.","The value of life itself cannot be estimated.","There are various eyes. Even the Sphinx has eyes: and as a result there are various truths, and as a result there is no truth.","The broad effects which can be obtained by punishment in man and beast, are the increase of fear, the sharpening of the sense of cunning, the mastery of the desires; so it is that punishment tames man, but does not make him \\"better.\\".","We must be cruel as well as compassionate: let us guard against becoming poorer than nature is!","One never perishes through anybody but oneself.","The noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power over himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has reverence for all that is severe and hard.","What is the vanity of the vainest man compared with the vanity which the most modest possesses when, in the midst of nature and the world, he feels himself to be man!","I love the valiant; but it is not enough to wield a broadsword, one must also know against whom.","The most unequivocal sign of contempt for man is to regard everybody merely as a means to one\'s own ends, or of no account whatever.","He who denies himself much in great matters will readily indulge himself in small things.","At times, our strengths propel us so far forward we can no longer endure our weaknesses and perish from them.","I live in my own place - have never copied anyone even half, and at any master who lacks the grace - to laugh at himself - I laugh.","An important species of pleasure, and therewith the source of morality, arises out of habit.","He who despises himself esteems himself as a self-despiser.","Art is the great stimulus to life.","I love those who do not know how to live for today.","It is only those who know how to feel that \\"this is not good\\" who devise improvements.","We grow hostile to many an artist or writer, not because we finally come to see he has deceived us, but because he thought no subtler means were required to ensnare us.","The sick are the greatest danger for the healthy; it is not from the strongest that harm comes to the strong, but from the weakest.","Every step forward is made at the cost of mental and physical pain to someone.","When one is young, one venerates and despises without that art of nuances which constitutes the best gain of life.","There are highly gifted spirits who are always infertile simply because, owing to a weakness in temperament, they are too impatient to wait out their pregnancy to term.","Once you were apes, yet even now man is more of an ape than any of the apes.","The person lives most beautifully who does not reflect upon existence","The secret of realizing the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment of existence is: to live dangerously! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships out into uncharted seas! Live in conflict with your equals and with yourselves! Be robbers and ravagers as soon as you ca not be rulers and owners, you men of knowledge! The time will soon past when you could be content to live concealed int he woods like timid deer!","What is Genius?- To aspire to a lofty aim and to will the means to that aim.","Learn to see - accustoming the eye to calm, to patience, to letting-things-come-to-it; learning to defer judgment, to encircle and encompass the question on all sides.","And if you are not a bird, then beware of coming to rest above an abyss.","How much truth can a spirit bear, how much truth can a spirit dare? ... that became for me more and more the real measure of value.","This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence - even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!","In art the end does not sanctify the means: but sacred means employed here can sanctify the end.","Words are but symbols for the relations of things to one another and to us; nowhere do they touch upon absolute truth... Through words and concepts we shall never reach beyond the wall off relations, to some sort of fabulous primal ground of things.","Ye are ugly? Well then, my brethren, take the sublime about you, the mantle of the ugly!","All in all, punishment hardens and renders people more insensible; it concentrates; it increases the feeling of estrangement; it strengthens the power of resistance.","Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.","There is in general good reason to suppose that in several respects the gods could all benefit from instruction by us human beings. We humans are - more humane.","You may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise. You must be proud of your enemy: then the success of your enemy shall be your success too.","Sleeping is no mean art: for its sake one must stay awake all day.","In the end things must be as they are and have always been--the great things remain for the great, the abysses for the profound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up shortly, everything rare for the rare.","Against boredom even gods struggle in vain.","That a person cannot and consequently will not defend himself, does not yet cast disgrace upon him in our eyes ; but we despise the person who has neither the ability nor the good will for revenge whether it be a man or a woman.","We are terrified by the idea of being terrified.","The inclination to self-depreciation, to freely accepting being robbed, being duped, and being swindled, could be the modesty of a god among men.","Faith actually moves no mountains, but instead raises them up where there were none before.","Read from a distant star, the majuscule script of our earthly existence would perhaps lead to the conclusion that the earth was the distinctively ascetic planet, a nook of disgruntled, arrogant creatures filled with a profound disgust with themselves, at the earth, at all life, who inflict as much pain on themselves as they possibly can out of pleasure in inflicting pain which is probably their only pleasure.","The same passions in man and woman nonetheless differ in tempo; hence man and woman do not cease misunderstanding one another.","Assuming that we have trained our imagination to denounce the past, we will not suffer much from unfulfilled wishes.","THE TEACHER AS A NECESSARY EVIL. Let us have as few people as possible between the productive minds and the hungry and recipient minds! The middlemen almost unconsciously adulterate the food which they supply. It is because of teachers that so little is learned, and that so badly.","The inability to lie is far from the love of truth.","... art approaches as a saving sorceress, expert at healing. She alone knows how to turn these nauseous thoughts about the horror or absurdity of existence into notions with which one can live.","You never exist quite so much as when you are not thinking","Dancing in all its forms cannot be excluded from the curriculum of all noble education; dancing with the feet, with ideas, with words, and, need I add that one must also be able to dance with the pen?","School has no task more important than to teach strict thought, cautious judgment, and logical conclusions, hence it must pay no attention to what hinders these operations, such as religion, for instance.","At bottom every man knows well enough that he is a unique being, only once on this earth; and by no extraordinary chance will such a marvelously picturesque piece of diversity in unity as he is, ever be put together a second time.","To call a thing good not a day longer than it appears to us good, and above all not a day earlier - that is the only way to keep joy pure.","No one can construct for you the bridge upon which precisely you must cross the stream of life, no one but you yourself alone.","Nothing ever succeeds which exuberant spirits have not helped to produce.","Who has not for the sake of his reputation sacrificed himself?","However unchristian it may seem, I do not even bear any ill feeling towards myself.","If there is something to pardon in everything, there is also something to condemn.","Against war it may be said that it makes the victor stupid and the vanquished revengeful.","Not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him who doth not concern us at all.","But are there many honest people who will admit that it is pleasing to give pain?","At every step one has to wrestle for truth; one has to surrender for it almost everything to which the heart, to which our love, our trust in life, cling otherwise. That requires greatness of soul: the service of truth is the hardest service. What does it mean, after all, to have integrity in matters of the spirit? That one is severe against one\'s heart...that one makes of every Yes and No a matter of conscience.","Whatever harm the evil may do, the harm done by the good is the most harmful harm.","Hold a true friend with both your hands.","In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering among innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge.","There is nothing more necessary than truth, and in comparison with it everything else has only secondary value. This absolute will to truth: what is it? Is it the will to not allow ourselves to be deceived? Is it the will not to deceive? One does not want to be deceived, under the supposition that it is injurious, dangerous, or fatal to be deceived.","Everything good is instinct--and, as a result, easy, necessary, free.","Convictions are prisons.","Enduring habits I hate.... Yes, at the very bottom of my soul I feel grateful to all my misery and bouts of sickness and everything about me that is imperfect, because this sort of thing leaves me with a hundred backdoors through which I can escape from enduring habits.","Cows sometimes wear an expression resembling wonderment arrested on its way to becoming a question. In the eye of superior intelligence, on the other hand, lies the nil admirari spread out like the monotony of a cloudless sky.","Style ought to prove that one believes in an idea; not only that one thinks it but also feels it.","It is only when we have ceased to be the followers of our followers that we comprehend how meaningless followers are.","Wherever I found a living creature, there I found the will to power.","Whoever has really sacrificed anything, knows that he wanted and got something in return.","To find everything profound - that is an inconvenient trait. It makes one strain one\'s eyes all the time, and in the end one finds more than one might have wished.","Should not the giver be thankful that the receiver received? Is not giving a need? Is not receiving, mercy?","Be generous in nature and thought; for this wins respect and gives confidence and power.","I consist of body and soul - in the worlds of a child. And why shouldn\'t we speak like children? But the enlightened, the knowledgealbe would say: I am body through and through, nothing more; and the soul is just a word for something on the body.","Deep is the well of truth and long does it take to know what has fallen into its depths.","The philosopher believes that the value of his philosophy lies in the whole, in the building: posterity discovers it in the bricks with which he built and which are then often used again for better building: in the fact, that is to say, that building can be destroyed and nonetheless possess value as material.","Necessity is not a fact; it\'s an interpretation.","I despise mystics, they fancy themselves so deep, when they aren\'t even superficial.","It takes just such painful and terrible things to occur for the great emancipation to take place.","With one more talent one frequently stands with greater instability than with one less, as a table stands better on three legs than on four.","Everyone thinks that the principal thing to the tree is the fruit, but in point of fact the principal thing to it is the seed.","A bad conscience is easier to cope with than a bad reputation.","The higher you ascend, the smaller you appear to the eye of envy. But most of all they hate those who fly.","If you go to see the woman, do not forget the whip.","Not he is great who can alter matter, but he who can alter my state of mind.","Whom do you call bad?--Those who always want to induce shame.","The beast in us must be[78] wheedled: ethic is necessary, that we may not be torn to pieces.","It is absolutely impossible for a subject to see or have insight into something while leaving itself out of the picture, so impossible that knowing and being are the most opposite of all spheres.","Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where is the madness with which you should be cleansed? Behold, I show you the Superman. He is this lightning, he is this madness.","The wisest man would be the one richest in contradictions, who has, as it were, antennae for all types of men---as well as his great moments of grand harmony---a rare accident even in us! A sort of planetary motion---","Laughter means: taking a mischievous delight in someone else\'s uneasiness, but with a good conscience.","The will to incessant creation is vulgar, betraying jealousy, envy, and ambition. Assuming that you are something, there is really nothing that you need to do-and yet you do a great deal. Above the \\"productive\\" man there is still a higher type.","One is necessary, one is a piece of fate, one belongs to the whole, one is the whole - there exists nothing which could judge, measure, compare, condemn our being, for that would be to judge, measure, compare, condemn the whole...But nothing exists apart from the whole!","No power can be maintained when it is only represented by hypocrites.","One often contradicts an opinion when what is uncongenial is really the tone in which it was conveyed.","Virtues are dangerous as vices insofar as they are allowed to rule over one as authorities and not as qualities one develops oneself.","All modern philosophizing is political, policed by governments, churches, academics, custom, fashion, and human cowardice, all off which limit it to a fake learnedness.","When one speaks of humanity, the idea is fundamental that this is something which separates and distinguishes man from nature. In reality, however, there is no such separation: \\"natural\\" qualities and those called truly \\"human\\" are inseparably grown together. Man, in his highest and noblest capacities, is wholly nature and embodies its uncanny dual character. Those of his abilities which are terrifying and considered inhuman may even be the fertile soil out of which alone all humanity can grow in impulse, deed, and work.","One should steal only where one cannot rob.","Go through the moral demands...one by one and you will find that man could not live up to them; the intention is not that he should become more moral, but that he should feel as sinful as possible. If man had failed to find this feeling pleasant - why should he have engendered such an idea and adhered to it for so long?... Man was by every means to be made sinful and thereby become excited, animated, enlivened in general. To excite, animate, enliven at any price.","The man who meets with a failure attributes this failure rather to the ill will of another than to fate.","One is healthy when one can laugh at the earnestness and zeal with which one has been hypnotized by any single detail of one\'s life.","Art is essentially the affirmation, the blessing, and the deification of existence.","Since men do not really respect anything unless it was established long ago and has developed slowly over time, those who want tokeep on living after their death must take worry not only about their future generations but even more about their past: that is why tyrants of all kinds (including tyrannical artists and politicians) like to do violence to history, so that it will appear as a preparation and stepladder to themselves.","You must await your thirst and allow it to become complete: otherwise you will never discover your spring, which can never be anyone else\'s!","Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman-a rope over an abyss. A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting","Who can attain to anything great if he does not feel in himself the force and will to inflict great pain? The ability to suffer is a small matter: in that line, weak women and even slaves often attain masterliness. But not to perish from internal distress and doubt when one inflicts great suffering and hears the cry of it that is great, that belongs to greatness.","We should not talk about our friends: otherwise we will talk away the feeling of friendship.","Knowing things halfway is a greater success than knowing things completely: it takes things to be simpler than they really are andso makes its opinions more easily understandable and persuasive.","Whoever is related to me in the height of his aspirations will experience veritable ecstasies of learning; for I come from heights that no bird ever reached in its flight, I know abysses into which no foot ever strayed.","There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, and, of its many rungs, three are the most important. People used to make human sacrifices to their god, perhaps even sacrificing those they loved the best ... Then, during the moral epoch of humanity, people sacrificed the strongest instincts they had, their \'nature,\' to their god... Finally: what was left to be sacrificed? ... Didn\'t people have to sacrifice God himself and worship rocks, stupidity, gravity, fate, or nothingness out of sheer cruelty to themselves?","The lack of closeness among friends is a fault that cannot be reprimanded without becoming incurable.","He who possesseth little is so much the less possessed. Blessed be moderate poverty!","Do not paint a picture either of God or the devil on your walls: this will ruin both your walls and the atmosphere.","What makes one heroic? - Going out to meet at the same time one\'s highest suffering and one\'s highest hope.","Even the bravest only rarely have courage for what they really know.","Oh, how much is today hidden by science! Oh, how much it is expected to hide!","If you believed more in life you would fling yourself less to the moment.","One does not know - cannot know - the best that is in one.","We become aware, however, that all customs, even the hardest, grow pleasanter and milder with time, and that the severest way of life may become a habit and therefore a pleasure.","Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not only writing but also thinking.","In everything one thing is impossible: rationality.","Nothing is beautiful, only man: on this piece of naivete rests all aesthetics, it is the first truth of aesthetics. Let us immediately add its second: nothing is ugly but degenerate man - the domain of aesthetic judgment is therewith defined.","We praise or blame as one or the other affords more opportunity for exhibiting our power of judgement.","One must learn to be a sponge if one wants to be loved by hearts that overflow.","Whoever knows he is deep tries to be clear, but whoever wants to seem deep to the crowd tries to be obscure. For the crowd supposes that anything it cannot see to the bottom must be deep: it is so timid and goes so unwillingly into the water.","A book calls for pen, ink, and a writing desk; today the rule is that pen, ink, and a writing desk call for a book.","I condemn Christianity; I bring against the Christian Church the most terrible of all accusations that an accuser has ever had in his mouth. It is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable corruptions; it seeks to work the ultimate corruption, the worse possible corruption. The Christian Church has left nothing untouched by its depravity; it has turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and every integrity into baseness of soul.","The perfect woman perpetrates literature as she perpetrates a small sin: as an experiment, in passing, glancing around to see whether anybody notices--and to make sure that somebody notices.","We deceive ourselves when giving respect to the person for whom we have surrendered ourselves, when we respectively expect them to be as we would wish them to be.","Rational thought is interpretation according to a scheme which we cannot escape.","We believe that we know something about the things themselves when we speak of trees, colors, snow, and flowers; and yet we possess nothing but metaphors for things - metaphors which correspond in no way to the original entities.","Truth will have no gods before it.- The belief in truth begins with the doubt of all truths in which one has previously believed.","Anyone who has declared someone else to be an idiot, a bad apple, is annoyed when it turns out in the end that he isn\'t.","Someone who does not write books, who thinks a lot, and who lives in unsatisfying society will usually be a good letter- writer.","From people who merely pray we must become people who bless.","Genuine historical knowledge requires nobility of character, a profound understanding of human existence - not detachment and objectivity.","They call you heartless; but you have a heart and I love you for being ashamed to show it.","Women and egoistic artists entertain a feeling towards science that is something composed of envy and sentimentality.","When a man has just been greatly honored and has eaten a little he is the most generous.","It is impossible to suffer without making someone pay for it; every complaint already contains revenge.","One thing a man must have: either a naturally light disposition or a disposition lightened by art and knowledge.","The definition of morality: Morality is the idiosyncrasy of decadents having the hidden desire to revenge themselves upon life - and being successful.","Species do not grow more perfect: the weaker dominate the strong, again and again- the reason being that they are the great majority, and they are also cleverer. Darwin forgot the mind (-that is English!): the weak possess more mind. ... To acquire mind, one must need mind-one loses it when one no longer needs it.","Well-meaning, helpful, good-natured attitudes of mind have not come to be honored on account of their usefulness, but because they are states of richer souls that are capable of bestowing and have their value in the feeling of the plenitude of life.","In order to be somebody you have to hold even your shadow in high regard.","In praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame.","It is not doubt,is certitude that drives you mad.","Whatever we think about and question a lot becomes questionable.","My humanity is a constant self-overcoming.","How much truth does a spirit endure, how much truth does it dare?","Sometimes all you need to do to win clever people over to a principle is to present it in the form of a shocking paradox.","One can only be silent and sit peacefully when one hath arrow and bow; otherwise one prateth and quarrelleth. Let your peace be a victory!","We talk about taking \\"pleasure in a thing\\": but in truth it is pleasure in ourselves, mediated by a thing.","Whoever despises himself still esteems the despiser within himself.","And when your soul becometh great, then doth it become haughty, and in your sublimity there is wickedness.","If we affirm one moment, we thus affirm not only ourselves but all existence. For nothing is self-sufficient, neither in us ourselves nor in things; and if our soul has trembled with happiness and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed to produce this one event - and in this single moment of affirmation all eternity was called good, redeemed, justified, and affirmed.","If a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which always recurs.","So far no one had had enough courage and intelligence to reveal me to my dear Germans. My problems are new, my psychological horizon frighteningly comprehensive, my language bold and clear; there may well be no books written in German which are richer in ideas and more independent than mine.","Art is the proper task of life.","But thought is one thing, the deed is another, and the image of the deed still another: the wheel of causality does not roll between them.","Not the intensity but the duration of high feelings makes high men.","As regards the celebrated struggle for life, it seems to me for the present to have been rather asserted than proved. It does occur, but as the exception; the general aspect of life is not hunger and distress, but rather wealth, luxury, even absurd prodigality -- where there is a struggle it is a struggle for power.","No victor believes in chance.","It is possible to imagine a society flushed with such a sense of power that it could afford to let its offenders go unpunished.","Do whatever you will, but first be such as are able to will.","Man is no longer an artist, he has become a work of art.","Digressions, objections, delight in mockery, carefree mistrust are signs of health.","I have exposed myself and am not ashamed to stand there naked. \\"Shame\\" is what we call the monster that attached itself to men when they aspired beyond the animals.","Bad cooks - and the utter lack of reason in the kitchen - have delayed human development longest and impaired it most.","The existence of forgetting has never been proved:  We only know that some things don\'t come to mind when we want them.","The strongest and most evil spirits have to date advanced mankind the most: they always rekindled the sleeping passions - all orderly arranged society lulls the passions to sleep; they always reawakened the sense of comparison, of contradiction, of delight in the new, the adventurous, the untried; they compelled men to set opinion against opinion, ideal plan against ideal plan.","The so-called paradoxes of an author, to which a reader takes exception, often exist not in the author\'s book at all, but rather in the reader\'s head.","O sancta simplicitas! What strange simplification and falsification mankind lives on! One can never cease to marvel once one has acquired eyes for this marvel! How we have made everything around us bright and free and easy and simple! How we have known how to bestow on our senses a passport to everything superficial, on our thoughts a divine desire for wanton gambling and false conclusions! - how we have from the very beginning understood how to retain our ignorance so as to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom, frivolity, impetuosity, bravery, cheerfulness of life, so as to enjoy life!","For men are not equal: thus speaks justice.","I love him whose soul is lavish, who wanteth no thanks and doth not give back: for he always bestoweth, and desireth not to keep for himself.","He who lives as children live - who does not struggle for his bread and does not believe that his actions possess any ultimate significance - remains childlike.","A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possesses at least two things besides: gratitude and purity.","If that glad message of your Bible were written in your faces, you would not need to demand belief in the authority of that book in such stiff-necked fashion.","It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that physics, too, is only an interpretation and exegesis of the world (to suit us, if I may say so!) and not a world-explanation.","Our destiny exercises its influence over us even when, as yet, we have not learned its nature: it is our future that lays down the law of our today","All words are prejudices.","Whoever regards human beings as a herd and flees them as swiftly as he can will no doubt be overtaken by them and impaled on theirhorns.","One is fruitful only at the cost of being rich in contradictions.","When thou goest to woman, take thy whip.","Philosophical systems are wholly true for their founders only.","Whereas the man of action binds his life to reason and its concepts so that he will not be swept away and lost, the scientific investigator builds his hut right next to the tower of science so that he will be able to work on it and to find shelter for himself beneath those bulwarks which presently exist.","The question of place and climate is most closely related to the question of nutrition. Nobody is free to live everywhere; and whoever has to solve great problems that challenge all his strength actually has a very restricted choice in this matter. The influence of climate on our metabolism, its retardation, its acceleration, goes so far that a mistaken choice of place and climate can not only estrange a man from his task but can actually keep it from him: he never gets to see it.","A friend should be a master at guessing and keeping still: you must not want to see everything.","Willing emancipateth: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipation - so teacheth you Zarathustra. No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah, that that great debility may ever be far from me! And also in discerning do I feel only my will\'s procreating and evolving delight.","Sensuality often makes love grow too quickly, so that the root remains weak and is easy to pull out.","When we talk in company we lose our unique tone of voice, and this leads us to make statements which in no way correspond to our real thoughts.","Evolution does not make happiness its goal; it aims simply at evolution and nothing else.","Experience, as a desire for experience, does not come off. We must not study ourselves while having an experience.","A woman\'s pity, which is talkative, carries the sick person\'s bed to the public marketplace.","Crude men who feel themselves insulted tend to assess the degree of insult as high as possible, and talk about the offense in greatly exaggerated language, only so they can revel to their heart\'s content in the aroused feelings of hatred and revenge.","If one considers how much reason every person has for anxiety and timid self-concealment, and how three-quarters of his energy and goodwill can be paralyzed and made unfruitful by it, one has to be very grateful to fashion","[Heraclitus] concluded that coming-to-be itself could not be anything evil or unjust.","It is a terrible thought, to contemplate that an immense number of mediocre thinkers are occupied with really influential matters.","Why couldn\'t the world that concerns us- be a fiction? And if somebody asked, \'but to be a fiction there surely belongs an author?\'- couldn\'t one answer simply: \'Why? Doesn\'t this \\"belongs\\" perhaps belong to the fiction, too?\'","Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things have a hatred even of figure and likeness.","If you have hitherto believed that life was one of the highest value and now see yourselves disappointed, do you at once have to reduce it to the lowest possible price?","Men after death ... are understood worse than men of the moment, but heard better.","The hour when you say, \\"What does my happiness matter? It is poverty and filth, and a wretched complacency. Yet my happiness should justify existence itself!","The unselective knowledge drive resembles the indiscriminate sexual drive--signs of vulgarity!","Folk music is the original melody of man; it is the musical mirror of the world.","One receives as reward for much ennui, despondency, boredom -such as a solitude without friends, books, duties, passions must bring with it -those quarter-hours of profoundest contemplation within oneself and nature. He who completely entrenches himself against boredom also entrenches himself against himself: he will never get to drink the strongest refreshing draught from his own innermost fountain.","One never dives into the water to save a drowning man more eagerly than when there are others present who dare not take the risk.","The good displeases us when we are not up to it.","One does not hate so long as one continues to rate low, but only when one has come to rate equal or higher.","It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a privilege of the strong.","Those who create are hard of heart.","Dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who experiences them, is not something dreadful also.","Either one does not dream, or one does so interestingly. One should learn to spend one\'s waking life in the same way: not at all, or interestingly.","Smooth iceis paradisefor those who dance with expertise.","Even great spirits have only their five-fingers\' breadth of experience - just beyond it their thinking ceases and their endless empty space and stupidity begins.","Whoever, at any time, has undertaken to build a new heaven has found the strength for it in his own hell.","Once we have found ourselves, we must understand how from time to time to lose--and then to find--ourselves once again: assuming,that is, that we are thinkers. For a thinker it is a drawback to be bound to a single person all the time.","Companions the creator seeks, not corpses, not herds and believers. Fellow creators the creator seeks -- those who write new values on new tablets. Companions the creator seeks, and fellow harvesters; for everything about him is ripe for the harvest.","Take a chance and try my fare! It will grow on you, I swear; Soon it will taste good to you!","Democracy represents the disbelief in all great men and in all elite societies: everybody is everybody\'s equal.","There is a stupid humility that is quite common and when a person is afflicted with it, he is once and for all disqualified for being a disciple of knowledge.","Art is not merely an imitation of the reality of nature, but in truth a metaphysical supplement to the reality of nature, placed alongside thereof for its conquest.","One has renounced the great life when one renounces war.","Illusions are certainly expensive amusements; but the destruction of illusions is still more expensive, if looked upon as an amusement, as it undoubtedly is by some people.","Rather perish than hate and fear, and twice rather perish than make oneself hated and feared \u2014 this must some day become the highest maxim for every single commonwealth.","Humility has the toughest hide.","Strength is the morality of the man who stands out from the rest, and it is mine.","The most common sort of lie is the one uttered to one\'s self.","To recognize untruth as a condition of life--that certainly means resisting accustomed value feelings in a dangerous way; and a philosophy that risks this would by that token alone place itself beyond good and evil.","The universe without music would be madness.","Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.","Watch them clamber, these swift monkeys! They clamber over one another and thus drag one another into the mud and the depth. They all want to get to the throne: that is their madness \u2014 as if happiness sat on the throne. Often, mud sits on the throne \u2014 and often the throne also on mud. Mad they all appear to me, clambering monkeys and overardent. Foul smells their idol, the cold monster: foul, they smell to me altogether, these idolators.","Even cohabitation has been corrupted - by marriage.","You say a good cause justifies any war; but I say a good war justifies any cause.","Warfare is the father of all good things, it is also the father of good prose!","Growth in wisdom can be measured precisely by decline in bile.","In what does the objective measure of value lie? In the quantum of enhanced and organized power alone, in accordance with what occurs in all occurrence, a will to increase.","Can an ass be tragic?--To perish under a burden that one can neither bear nor cast off? The case of the philosopher.","Many deeds are done so as to forget another deed: there are also opiate activities. I exist so that another will be forgotten.","You must be born for your physician, otherwise you are bound to perish because of your physician.","Pity is extolled as the virtue of prostitutes.","The spiritualization of sensuality is called love: it is a great triumph over Christianity.","Lust and self-mutilation are closely related impulses. There are also self-mutilators among knowers: they do not want to be creators under any circumstances.","With the unknown, one is confronted with danger, discomfort, and care; the first instinct is to abolish these painful states. First principle: any explanation is better than none. . . . The causal instinct is thus conditional upon, and excited by, the feeling of fear. The \\"why?\\" shall, if at all possible, not give the cause for its own sake so much as for a particular kind of cause -- a cause that is comforting, liberating, and relieving.","A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love.","Woman was God\'s second mistake.","Stupidity in a woman is unfeminine.","Preparatory human beings. - I welcome all signs that a more virile, warlike age is about to begin, which will restore honour to courage above all! For this age shall prepare the way for one yet higher, and it shall gather the strength that this higher age will require some day - the age that will carry heroism into the search for knowledge and that will wage wars for the sake of ideas and their consequences.","A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to its own god.","There is a universal need to exercise some kind of power, or to create for one\'s self the appearance of some power, if only temporarily, in the form of intoxication.","And if a friend does you wrong, then say: \\"I forgive you what you have done to me; that you have done it to YOURSELF, however--how could I forgive that!","The reasons and purposes for habits are always lies that are added only after some people begin to attack these habits and to ask for reasons and purposes. At this point the conservatives of all ages are thoroughly dishonest: they add lies.","\'He who seeks may easily get lost himself. It is a crime to go apart and be alone.\' Thus speaks the herd.","What the philosopher is seeking is not truth, but rather the metamorphosis of the world into man.","whatever is profound loves masks; what is most profound even hates image and parable.","To be natural means to dare to be as immoral as Nature is.","Inaction, letting be, neither creating nor destroying--that is my evil. And also the knower as one without desire.","What a dissimilarity we see in walking, swimming, and flying. And yet it is one and the same motion: it is just that the load- bearing capacity of the earth differs from that of the water, and that that of the water differs from that of the air! Thus we should also learn to fly as thinkers--and not imagine that we are thereby becoming idle dreamers!","Thus strength is afforded by good and thorough customs, thus is learnt the subjection of the individual, and strenuousness of character becomes a birth gift and afterwards is fostered as a habit.","They would have to sing better songs for me to learn to have faith in their Redeemer; and his disciples would have to look more redeemed!","One must know how to conserve oneself- the best test of independence.","Every profound spirit needs a mask: even more, around every profound spirit a mask is continually growing.","It is good to express a thing twice right at the outset and so to give it a right foot and also a left one. Truth can surely stand on one leg, but with two it will be able to walk and get around.","Men have hitherto treated women like birds which have strayed down to them from the heights; as something more delicate, more fragile, more savage, stranger, sweeter, soulful--but as something which has to be caged up so that it shall not fly away.","Close beside my knowledge lies my black ignorance.","When I seek another word for \'music\', I never find any other word than \'Venice\'","People press toward the light not in order to see better but in order to shine better.--We are happy to regard the one before whomwe shine as light.","The highest type of free men should be sought where the highest resistance is constantly overcome: five steps from tyranny, close to the threshold of the danger of servitude.","Strong hope is a much greater stimulant of life than any single realised joy could be.","The followers of a great man often put their eyes out, so that they may be the better able to sing his praise.","Asceticism is the right way of thinking for those who have to extirpate their sensual drives because they are ravening beasts of prey. But only for those!","A great value of antiquity lies in the fact that its writings are the only ones that modern men still read with exactness.","Look not into the sun! Even the moon is too bright for your nocturnal eyes!","There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy.","Anecdote: Greatness Means Leading the Way. No stream is large and copious of itself, but becomes great by receiving and leading on so many tributary streams. It is so, also, with all intellectual greatness, It is only a question of someone indicating the direction to be followed by so many affluent; not whether he was richly or poorly gifted originally.","Learn to laugh at yourselves as one must laugh!","And I offer you this parable: Not a few who sought to cast out their devil entered into the swine themselves.","I love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth himself, and all things are in him: thus all things become his down-going.","Every high degree of power always involves a corresponding degree of freedom from good and evil.","We must take precautions against being prematurely honed sharp--since at the same time we are being prematurely honed thin.","But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants to be nowhere--until the whole body is decayed and withered by the petty infection... Thus spoke Zarathustra.","Suspicious.- To admit a belief merely because it is a custom - but that means to be dishonest, cowardly, lazy! - And so could dishonesty, cowardice and laziness be the preconditions for morality?","We are unknown to ourselves, we men of knowledge - and with good reason. We have never sought ourselves - how could it happen that we should ever find ourselves? It has rightly been said: \\"Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\\"; our treasure is where the beehives of our knowledge are.","Tolerance is a proof of distrust in one\'s own ideals.","You say that I should be your teacher! See to it that I am your pinion and not your brake.","The consequence is that every man comes to know himself solely in terms of his power for defence and attack.","Whatever may be your desire to accomplish great deeds, the deep silence of pregnancy never comes to you! The event of the day sweeps you along like straws before the wind whilst ye lie under the illusion that ye are chasing the event,-poor fellows! If a man wishes to act the hero on the stage he must not think of forming part of the chorus; he should not even know how the chorus is made up.","He who rejoices even at the stake triumphs not over pain but over the absence of pain where he had anticipated feeling it. A parable.","In large states public education will always be mediocre, for the same reason that in large kitchens the cooking is usually bad.","There are two types of genius; one which above all begets and wants to beget, and another which prefers being fertilized and giving birth.","Narrow souls I cannot abide; There\'s almost no good or evil inside","Do I advise you to love the neighbor? I suggest rather to escape from the neighbor and to love those who are the farthest away from you. Higher than the love for the neighbor is the love for the man who is distant and has still to come.","Every power draws its ultimate consequences at every moment.","The desire to create continually is vulgar and betrays jealousy, envy, ambition. If one is something one really does not need to make anything --and one nonetheless does very much. There exists above the \'\'productive\'\' man a yet higher species.","To our strongest impulse, to the tyrant in us, not only our reason but also our conscience yields.","Actual philosophers... are commanders and law-givers: they say \\"thus it shall be!\\", it is they who determine the Wherefore and Whither of mankind, and they possess for this task the preliminary work of all the philosophical laborers, of all those who have subdued the past - they reach for the future with creative hand, and everything that is or has been becomes for them a means, an instrument, a hammer.","The greatest giver of alms is cowardice.","And it is the great noon when man stands at the midpoint of his course between beast and superman and celebrates his way to the evening as his highest hope: for it is the way to a new morning.","In a certain state it is indecent to live longer.","Sometimes it is harder to accede to a thing than it is to see its truth.","For out of fear and need each religion is born, creeping into existence on the byways or reason.","O my brothers, am I then cruel? But I say: that which is falling should also be pushed!","The strongest knowledge (that of the total freedom of the human will) is nonetheless the poorest in successes: for it always has the strongest opponent, human vanity.","The sick woman especially: no one surpasses her in refinements for ruling, oppressing, tyrannising.","There is sense in hoping for recognition in a distant future only when we take it for granted that mankind will remain essentially unchanged, and that whatever is great is not for one age only but will be looked upon as great for all time.","At the very moment when someone is beginning to take philosophy seriously, the whole world believes the opposite.","God is a gross answer, an indelicacy against us thinkers- at bottom merely a gross prohibition for us: you shall not think!","Truths are illlusions which we have forgotten are illusions.","\\"Body am I, and soul\\" - so saith the child. And why should one not speak like children?","All that the world most needs today, is combined in the most seductive manner in his art, \u2014 the three great stimulants of exhausted people: brutality, artificiality and innocence (idiocy).","The great wars of the present age are the effects of the study of history.","I am afraid that old women are more skeptical in their most secret heart of hearts than any man: they believe in the superficiality of existence as in its essence, and all virtue and profundity is to them merely a veil over this \\"truth,\\" a most welcome veil over a pudendum--and so a matter of decency and modesty, and nothing else.","A man who whinnies with noisy laughter, surpasses all the animals in vulgarity.","The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The Superman shall be the meaning of the earth!","What is not intelligible to me is not necessarily unintelligent","How can a man know himself? He is a thing dark and veiled; and if the hare has seven skins, man can slough off seventy times seven and still not be able to say: \\"this is really you, this is no longer outer shell.","A sure way to irritate people and to put evil thoughts into their heads is to keep them waiting a long time. This makes them immoral.","The destiny of the human race is to widen the gap separating it from the lower races of animals. Any code of morality which retains its permanence and authority after the conditions of existence which gave rise to it have changed, works against this upward progress of man.","Fathers and sons are much more considerate of one another than mothers and daughters.","one does not only wish to be understood when one writes; one wishes just as surely not to be understood.","Rendering oneself unarmed when one had been the best-armed, out of a height of feeling-that is the means to real peace, which must always rest on a peace of mind.","Because we have for millenia made moral, aesthetic, religious demands on the world, looked upon it with blind desire, passion or fear, and abandoned ourselves to the bad habits of illogical thinking, this world has gradually become so marvelously variegated, frightful, meaningful, soulful, it has acquired color - but we have been the colorists: it is the human intellect that has made appearances appear and transported its erroneous basic conceptions into things.","The newspaper reader says: this party will ruin itself if it makes errors like this. My higher politics says: a party which makes errors like this is already finished -- it is no longer secure in its instincts.","The doctrine of equality! There exists no more poisonous poison: for it seems to be preached by justice itself, while it is the end of justice.","When on a Sunday morning we hear the old bells ring out, we ask ourselves, \\"Is it possible! This is done on account of a Jew crucified two thousand years ago who said he was the Son of God. The proof of such an assertion is wanting\\".","Behind a remarkable scholar we not infrequently find an average human being, and behind an average artist we often find a very remarkable human being.","How far is truth susceptible of embodiment? That is the question, that is the experiment.","The life of the enemy . Whoever lives for the sake of combating an enemy has an interest in the enemy\'s staying alive.","The Germans are like women, you can scarcely ever fathom their depths - they haven\'t any.","The final reward of the dead - to die no more","The criminal is quite frequently not equal to his deed: he belittles and slanders it.","I awoke you from your sleep because I saw that you were having a nightmare. And now you are cross and say to me: \\"What are we supposed to do now? Everything is still night!\\" You ingrates! You should go to sleep again and dream better.","A good seat on a horse steals away your opponent\'s courage and your onlooker\'s heart-what reason is there to attack? Sit like one who has conquered?","There exists above the \\"productive\\" man a yet higher species.","My brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however, is the evil; necessary are the envy and the distrust and the back-biting among the virtues.","What then in the last resort are the truths of mankind? They are the irrefutable errors of mankind.","Children from humble families must be taught how to command just as other children must be taught how to obey.","Words are but symbols for the relations of things to one another and to us; nowhere do they touch upon absolute truth.","There would be no sunshine in society if the born flatterers, I mean the so-called amiable people, did not bring it in with them.","The first opinion that occurs to us when we are suddenly asked about something is usually not our own but only the current one pertaining to our class, position, or parentage; our own opinions seldom swim on the surface.","The golden age, when rambunctious spirits were regarded as the source of evil.","One should never know too precisely whom one has married","We are, all of us, growing volcanoes that approach the hour of their eruption, but how near or distant that is, nobody knows- not even God.","You shall not steal! You shall not kill! Such words were once called holy; before them people bowrd their knees and heads, and removed their shoes. But I ask you: where have there ever been better thieves and killers in the world than such holy words have been? Is there not in all of life itself - robbing and killing? And when such words were called holy, was not truth itself thereby - killed?","New ways I go, a new speech comes to me; weary I grow, like all creators, of the old tongues. My spirit no longer wants to walk on worn soles.","Ten times must you laugh during the day, and be cheerful; otherwise your stomach, the father of affliction, will disturb you in the night.","There is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on Plato\'s secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no \'Bible,\' nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic - but a book of Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured life - a Greek life which he repudiated - without an Aristophanes!","All great artists and thinkers are great workers.","More and more it seems to me that the philosopher, being of necessity a man of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, has always found himself, and had to find himself, in contradiction to his today: his enemy was ever the ideal of today. So far all these extraordinary furtherers of men whom one calls philosophers, though they themselves have rarely felt like friends of wisdom but rather like disagreeable fools and dangerous question marks, have found their task, their hard, unwanted, inescapable task, but eventually also the greatness of their task, in being the bad conscience of their time.","A subject for a great poet would be God\'s boredom after the seventh day of creation.","But not to perish from internal distress and doubt when one inflicts great suffering and hears the cry of suffering : that is great, that belongs to greatness.","Many other such substitutes for war will be discovered, but perhaps precisely thereby it will become more and more obvious that such a highly cultivated and therefore necessarily enfeebled humanity as that of modern Europe not only needs wars, but the greatest and most terrible wars, consequently occasional relapses into barbarism, lest, by the means of culture, it should lose its culture and its very existence.","All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks, in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity.","The view that honesty is something, and even a virtue, belongs, it is true, to those private opinions which are forbidden in this age of public opinions.","For nothing is more democratic than logic; it is no respecter of persons and makes no distinction between crooked and straight noses.","Every virtue inclines to stupidity, every stupidity to virtue; \\"stupid to the point of sanctity,\\" they say in Russia, - let us be careful lest out of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores!","What is originality? To see something that has no name as yet and hence cannot be mentioned although it stares us all in the face. The way men usually are, it takes a name to make something visible for them.","If ye would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not get yourselves carried aloft; do not seat yourselves on other people\'s backs and heads!","Without meaning, without substance, without aim: a mere \'public opinion\'.","My abyss speaks, I have turned my ultimate depth inside out into the light.","Truth as Circe. - Error has transformed animals into men; is truth perhaps capable of changing man back into an animal?","The best author will be the one who is ashamed to become a writer.","Body am I entirely, and nothing else; and soul is only a word for something about the body.","Some mothers need happy children; others need unhappy ones-otherwise they cannot prove their maternal virtues.","Will, pure will, without the troubles and complexities of intellect - how happy! how free!","The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will of another, or of several other, emotions.","Science ... has no consideration for ultimate purposes, any more than Nature has, but just as the latter occasionally achieves things of the greatest suitableness without intending to do so, so also true science, as the imitator of nature in ideas, will occasionally and in many ways further the usefulness and welfare of man,-but also without intending to do so.","Whoever does not have a good father should procure one.","All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle","We criticize a thinker more acutely when he advances a proposition that is disagreeable to us; and yet it would be more reasonableto do so when his proposition is agreeable to us.","Was aus Liebe getan wird, geschieht immer jenseits von Gut und B\xf6se. (What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil.)","To become the founder of a new religion one must be psychologically infallible in one\'s knowledge of a certain average type of souls who have not yet recognized that they belong together.","Buddhism is a hundred times as realistic as Christianity it is part of its living heritage that it is able to face problems objectively and coolly; it is the product of long centuries of philosophical speculation.","If there is to be art, if there is to be any aesthetic doing and seeing, one physiological condition is indispensable: frenzy.","The man of the future who will redeem us not only from the hitherto reigning ideal but also from that which was bound to grow out of it, the great nausea, the will to nothingness, nihilism; this bell stroke of noon and of the great decision that liberates the will again and restores its goal to the earth and his hope to man; this Antichrist and anti-nihilist; this victor over God and nothingness - he must come one day.","In laughter all that is evil comes together, but is pronounced holy and absolved by its own bliss.","This sign I give you: every people speaks its tongue of good and evil, which the neighbor does not understand. It has invented its own language of customs and rights.","We only hear questions that we are able to answer.","Living in a constant chase after gain compels people to expend their spirit to the point of exhaustion.","People who comprehend a thing to its very depths rarely stay faithful to it forever. For they have brought its depths into the light of day: and in the depths there is always much that is unpleasant to see.","No man ever wrote more eloquently and luminously [than Heraclitus].","The most serious parody I have ever heard was this: In the beginning was nonsense, and the nonsense was with God, and the nonsense was God.","We count the courtesies accorded us by unpopular people as offenses.","The will to truth is merely the longing for a stable world.","Everything good is the transmutation of something evil: every god has a devil for a father.","People who wish to numb our caution in dealing with them by means of flattery are employing a dangerous expedient, like a sleeping draught, which, if it does not put us to sleep, keeps us all the more awake.","We do not place especial value on the possession of a virtue until we notice its total absence in our opponent.","We, however, want to become those we are--human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves. To that end we must become the best learners and discoverers of everything that is lawful and necessary in the world: we must become physicists in order to be able to be creators in this sense--while hitherto all valuations and ideals have been based on ignorance of physics or were constructed so as to contradict it. Therefore: long live physics! And even more so that which compels us to turn to physics--our honesty!","What is the greatest thing ye can experience? It is the hour of great contempt. The hour in which even your happiness becometh loathsome unto you, and so also your reason and virtue.","A refined nature is vexed by knowing that some one owes it thanks, a coarse nature by knowing that it owes thanks to some one.","If we train our conscience, it kisses us while it hurts","Desire is happiness: satisfaction as happiness is merely the ultimate moment of desire. To be wish and wish alone is happiness, and a new wish over and over again.","Whoever commits to paper what he suffers becomes a melancholy author: but he becomes a serious author when he tells us what he suffered and why he now reposes in joy.","About sacrifice and the offering of sacrifices, sacrificial animals think quite differently from those who look on: but they have never been allowed to have their say.","How much reverence has a noble man for his enemies!--and such reverence is a bridge to love.--For he desires his enemy for himself, as his mark of distinction; he can endure no other enemy than one in whom there is nothing to despise and very much to honor! In contrast to this, picture \\"the enemy\\" as the man of ressentiment conceives him--and here precisely is his deed, his creation: he has conceived \\"the evil enemy,\\" \\"the Evil One,\\" and this in fact is his basic concept, from which he then evolves, as an afterthought and pendant, a \\"good one\\"--himself!","When somebody dies we usually need reasons for consolation, not so much to alleviate our pain as to excuse ourselves for so readily feeling consoled.","...the only psychologist from whom I have anything to learn.","If Islam despises Christianity, it has a thousandfold right to do so: Islam at least assumes that it is dealing with men.","The thirst for equality can express itself either as a desire to draw everyone down to one\'s level, or to raise oneself and everyone else up.","Something might be true while being harmful and dangerous in the highest degree. Indeed, it might be a basic characteristic of existence that those who know it completely would perish, in which case the strength of a spirit should be measured according to how much of the \'truth\' one could still barely endure- or to put it more clearly, to what degree one would require it to be thinned down, shrouded, sweetened, blunted, falsified.","Woman understands children better than man does, but man is more childlike than woman.","Death. The certain prospect of death could sweeten every life with a precious and fragrant drop of levity- and now you strange apothecary souls have turned it into an ill-tasting drop of poison that makes the whole of life repulsive.","My wisdom has long accumulated like a cloud, it becomes stiller and darker. So does all wisdom which shall one day bear lightnings.","From the Sun I learned this: when he goes down, overrich; he pours gold into the sea out of inexhaustible riches, so that even the poorest fisherman still rows with golden oars. For this I once saw and I did not tire of my tears as I watched it.","What is done out of love always occurs beyond good and evil.","Christianity has done its utmost to close the circle and declared even doubt to be sin. One is supposed to be cast into belief without reason, by a miracle, and from then on to swim in it as in the brightest and least ambiguous of elements: even a glance towards land, even the thought that one perhaps exists for something else as well as swimming, even the slightest impulse of our amphibious nature","It is, indeed, a fact that, in the midst of society and sociability every evil inclination has to place itself under such great restraint, don so many masks, lay itself so often on the procrustean bed of virtue, that one could well speak of a martyrdom of the evil man. In solitude all this falls away. He who is evil is at his most evil in solitude: which is where he is at his best - and thus to the eye of him who sees everywhere only a spectacle also at his most beautiful.","Even truthfulness is but one means to knowledge, a ladder--but not the ladder.","You are treading the path to your greatness: no one shall follow you here! Your passage has effaced the path behind you, and above that path stands written: Impossibility.","Love brings to light a lover\'s noble and hidden qualities-his rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive of his normal qualities.","Admiration for a quality or an art can be so strong that it deters us from striving to possess it.","All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man? A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment.","The earth has become small, and on it hops the last man, who makes everything small. His race can no more be exterminated than the flea can be. The last man lives the longest.","Heroism--that is the disposition of a man who aspires to a goal compared to which he himself is wholly insignificant. Heroism is the good will to self-destruction.","The beautiful exists just as little as the true. In every case it is a question of the conditions of preservation of a certain type of man: thus the herd-man will experience the value feeling of the true in different things than will the overman.","One hears but one does not seek; one takes -- one does not ask who gives; a thought flashes up like lightning, it comes of necessity and unfalteringly formed.","Woman is essentially unpeaceful, like the cat, however well she may have trained herself to present an appearance of peace.","That lies should be necessary to life is part and parcel of the terrible and questionable character of existence.","Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love, prevents the Christians of today - burning us.","A degree of culture, and assuredly a very high one, is attained when man rises above superstitions and religious notions and fears, and, for instance, no longer believes in guardian angels or in original sin, and has also ceased to talk of the salvation of his soul.","Really unreflective people are now inwardly without Christianity, and the more moderate and reflective people of the intellectual middle class now possess only an adapted, that is to say marvelously simplified Christianity. A god who in his love arranges everything in a manner that in the end will be best for us; a god who gives to us and takes from us our virtue and our happiness, so that as a whole all is meet and fit and there is no reason for us to take life sadly, let alone exclaim against it; in short, resignation and modest demands elevated to godhead","You want to be paid as well, you virtuous! You want reward for virtue, and heaven for earth, and eternity for your today?","On every parable you ride to every truth.","Everyone wants to be foremost in this future-and yet death and the stillness of death are the only things certain and common to all in this future! How strange that this sole thing that is certain and common to all, exercises almost no influence on men, and that they are the furthest from regarding themselves as the brotherhood of death! It makes me happy to see that men do not want to think at all of the idea of death!","Man is at his furthest remove from the animal as a child, his intellect most human. With his fifteenth year and puberty he comes astep closer to the animal; with the sense of possessions of his thirties (the median line between laziness and greediness), still another step. In his sixtieth year of life he frequently loses his modesty as well, then the septuagenarian steps up to us as a completely unmasked beast: one need only look at the eyes and the teeth.","A martyr\'s disciples suffer more than the martyr.","The disappointed one speaks. I searched for great human beings; I always found only the apes of their ideals.","In this state one enriches everything out of one\'s own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power\u2014until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is\u2014art.","The overman...Who has organized the chaos of his passions, given style to his character, and become creative. Aware of life\'s terrors, he affirms life without resentment.","The doer is merely a fiction added to the deed ? the deed is everything.","Hope, in its stronger forms, is a great deal more powerful stimulans to life than any sort of realized joy can ever be. Man must be sustained in suffering by a hope so high that no conflict with actuality can dash it - so high, indeed, that no fulfilment can satisfy it: a hope reaching out beyond this world.","And nobody lies as much as the indignant do.","The transition from Religion to Scientific contemplation is a violent, dangerous leap, which is not to be recommended. In order to make this transition, art is far rather to be employed to relieve the mind overburdened with emotions. Out of the illogical comes much good. It is so firmly rooted in the passions, in language, in art, in religion, and generally in everything which gives value to life. It is only the naive people who can believe that the nature of man can be changed into a purely logical one. We have yet to learn that others can suffer, and this can never be completely learned.","Every characteristic absence of spirituality, every piece of common vulgarity, is due to an inability to resist a stimulus - you have to react, you follow every impulse.","Ah, only he who knows where he sails, knows what wind is good, and a fair wind for him.","I looked for great men, but all I found were the apes of their ideals.","Man alone resists the direction of gravitation: he constantly wants to fall--upwards.","Man is something that shall be overcome.... Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman -- a rope over an abyss... What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.","The usual false conclusions of mankind are these: a thing exists, therefore it has a right to exist.","People to whom their daily life appears too empty and monotonous easily grow religious; this is comprehensible and excusable, only they have no right to demand religious sentiments from those whose daily life is not empty and monotonous.","It is obvious that all sense has gone out of modern marriage; which is, however, no objection to marriage but to modernity.","...one can speak with the utmost clearness, and yet not be heard by anyone.","Many people wait throughout their whole lives for the chance to be good in their own fashion.","Many a man fails as an original thinker simply because his memory it too good.","What else is love but understanding and rejoicing in the fact that another person lives acts and experiences otherwise than we do?","Our body is simply a social structure made of many souls.","Exhaustion is the shortest way to equality and fraternity.","Reason is the cause of our falsification of the evidence of the senses. In so far as the senses show becoming, passing away, change, they do not lie.","What is it that endowed things with meaning, value, significance? The creating heart, which desired, and, out of its desire, created. It created joy and woe. It wanted to satiate itself with woe. We must take all the suffering that has been endured by men and animals upon ourselves and affirm it, and possess a goal in which it acquires reason.","It is certain that the Jew, if he desired-or if they were driven to it, as the antisemites seem to wish-could now have the ascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe; that they are not working or planning for that end is equally sure... The resourcefulness of the modern Jews, both in mind and soul, is extraordinary.","What we do in dreams we also do when we are awake: we invent and fabricate the person with whom we associate - and immediately forget we have done so.","In the last analysis, even the best man is evil: in the last analysis, even the best woman is bad.","One had better put on gloves before handling the New Testament. The presence of so much filth makes it highly advisable.","Illness is a clumsy attempt to arrive at health: we must come to nature\'s aid with intellect.","Man, full of emptiness and torn apart with homesickness for the desert has had to create from within himself an adventure, a torture-chamber, an unsafe and hazardous wilderness- this fool, this prisoner consumed with longing and despair, became the inventor of \'bad conscience\'.","Intoxicating joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his suffering and forget himself. Intoxicating joy and self-forgetting, did the world once seem to me.","The great man fights the elements in his time that hinder his own greatness, in other words his own freedom and sincerity.","Towards gnats and fleas we should show no pity. We would do right to hang petty thieves, petty calumniators, and slanderers.","The best of all things is something entirely outside your grasp: not to be born, not to be, to be nothing. But the second-best thing for you - is to die soon.","A good writer possesses not only his own spirit but also the spirit of his friends.","What does your conscience say? \u2014 \'You should become the person you are\'.","Artists may here have a more subtle scent: they know only too well that it is precisely when they cease to act \'voluntarily\' and do everything of necessity that their feeling of freedom, subtlety, fullness of power, creative placing, disposing, shaping reaches its height - in short, that necessity and \'freedom of will\' are then one in them.","He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.","The wheel and the brake have different duties, but also one in common: to hurt one another.","Man, however, is the most courageous animal: thereby has he overcome every animal. With sound of triumph has he overcome every pain; human pain, however, is the sorest pain.","Every relationship that does not raise us up pulls us down, and vice versa; this is why men usually sink down somewhat when they take wives while women are usually somewhat raised up. Overly spiritual men require marriage every bit as much as they resist it as bitter medicine.","The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you allure the senses to it.","Sometimes in conversation the sound of our own voice distracts us and misleads us into making assertions that in no way express our true opinions.","What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man.","Go through the towns and ask yourselves whether these people should reproduce! Let them go to their whores!","Be careful, lest in casting out your demon you exorcise the best thing in you.","Lightning and thunder need time, the light of the stars needs time, deeds need time, even after they are done, to be seen and heard.","Life is at an end where the kingdom of God begins","We want to be poets of our life first of all in the smallest most everyday matters.","What does not destroy me, makes me stronger.","Concerning great things one should either be silent or speak loftily.","Those who are failures from the start, downtrodden, crushed -- it is they, the weakest, who must undermine life among men, who call into question and poison most dangerously our trust in life, in man, and in ourselves.","Where there is the tree of knowledge, there is always Paradise: so say the most ancient and most modern serpents.","I feel all those human beings to be pernicious who can no longer oppose what they love: they thereby ruin the best things and people.","Books for general reading always smell bad; the odor of common people hangs around them.","Surrounded by the flames of jealousy, the jealous one winds up, like the scorpion, turning the poisoned sting against himself.","Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive - so wisdom wisheth us; she is a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior.","If all alms were given only from pity, all beggars would have starved long ago.","I devote myself to what I love the most, and for this very reason I hesitate to designate it with lofty words: I do not want to risk believing that it is a sublime compulsion, a law, which I obey: I love what I love the most too much to wish to appear to it as one compelled.","The advantage of a bad memory is that one enjoys several times the same good things for the first time.","My time has not yet come either; some are born posthumously.","The State is the coldest of all cold monsters, and coldly it tells lies, and this lie drones on from its mouth: \'I, the State, am the people\'.","That every will must consider every other will its equal would be a principle hostile to life, an agent of the dissolution and destruction of man, an attempt to assassinate the future of man, a sign of weariness, a secret path to nothingness.","The Christian resolution to find the world ugly and bad has made the world ugly and bad.","Love of one is a piece of barbarism: for it is practised at the expense of all others. Love of God likewise.","One has to know the size of one\'s stomach.","I have not the capability to give you my loyalty, nor do I have the vanity to appear as if I did.","The states in which we infuse a transfiguration and a fullness into things and poetize about them until they reflect back our fullness and joy in life... three elements principally: sexuality, intoxication and cruelty all belonging to the oldest festal joys.","Alas, where is there still a sea in which one could drown: thus our lament resounds \u2013 across shallow swamps.","When good friends praise a gifted person he often appears to be delighted with them out of politeness and goodwill, but in reality he feels indifferent.","When we dream about those who are long since forgotten or dead, it is a sign that we have undergone a radical transformation and that the ground on which we live has been completely dug up: then the dead rise up, and our antiquity becomes modernity.","All preachers of morality, as also all theologians have a bad habit in common: all of them try to persuade man that he is very ill, and that a severe, final, radical cure is necessary.","If you stare into the Abyss long enough the Abyss stares back at you.","Tragedy is dead! Poetry itself died with it! Away, away with you, puny, stunted imitators! Away with you to Hades, and eat your fill of the old masters\' crumbs!","As long as you still experience the stars as something \\"above you\\", you lack the eye of knowledge.","Wherever on earth the religious neurosis has appeared we find it tied to three dangerous dietary demands: solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinence.","That is an artist as I would have an artist be, modest in his needs: he really wants only two things, his bread and his art--panemet Circen.","Mothers easily become jealous of their sons\' friends when they are particularly successful. As a rule a mother loves herself in her son more than she does the son himself.","Every virtue has its privilege: for example, that of contributing its own little bundle of wood to the funeral pyre of one condemned.","In order to acquire intellect one must need it. One loses it when it is no longer necessary.","There is always some madness in love.","Fanatics are picturesque, mankind would rather see gestures than listen to reasons.","There is a certain right by which we many deprive a man of life, but none by which we may deprive him of death; this is mere cruelty.","Lying very still and thinking very little is the most inexpensive medicine for all the sicknesses of the soul, and when administered with good intentions it grows more and more pleasant with each passing hour.","Love is more afraid of change than destruction.","It\'s not the intensity of the man, but the duration of his intensity that makes the man great.","Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world, e.g., on the assumption that there areequal things, that the same thing is identical at different points in time: but this science arose as a result of the opposite belief (that such things actually exist in the real world). And it is the same with mathematics, which would certainly never have arisen if it had been understood from the beginning that there is no such thing in nature as a perfectly straight line, a true circle, and absolute measure.","One is punished best for one\'s virtues.","Astrology presupposes that the heavenly bodies are regulated in their movements in harmony with the destiny of mortals: the moral man presupposes that that which concerns himself most nearly must also be the heart and soul of things.","What is it that you love in others?--My hopes.","Whoever possesses abundant joy must be a good man: but he is probably not the cleverest man, although he achieves exactly what it is that the cleverest man strives with all his cleverness to achieve.","He who has attained the freedom of reason to any extent cannot, for a long time, regard himself otherwise than as a wanderer on the face of the earth - and not even as a traveler towards a final goal, for there is no such thing. But he certainly wants to observe and keep his eyes open to whatever actually happens in the world; therefore he cannot attach his heart too firmly to anything individual; he must have in himself something wandering that takes pleasure in change and transitoriness.","The greatest progress that the human race has made lies in learning how to make correct inferences.","Science rushes headlong, without selectivity, without \\"taste,\\" at whatever is knowable, in the blind desire to know all at any cost.","It is our taste that decides against Christianity now, no longer our reasons.","On all the walls, wherever walls exist, I will inscribe this eternal indictment of Christianity--I have letters to make even blindmen see.... I call Christianity the single great curse, the single great innermost depravity, the single great instinct of revenge, for which no means is poisonous, secretive, subterranean, small enough--I call it mankind\'s single immortal blemish.... And we reckon time from the dies nefastus with which this calamity arose--following Christianity\'s first day!--Why not following its last day, instead?--Following today?--Transvaluation of all values!","The church is precisely that against which Jesus preached -- and against which he taught his disciples to fight.","I am interested only in the relations of a people to the rearing of the individual man, and among the Greeks the conditions were unusually favourable for the development of the individual; not by any means owing to the goodness of the people, but because of the struggles of their evil instincts.With the help of favourable measures great individuals might be reared who would be both different from and higher than those who heretofore have owed their existence to mere chance. Here we may still be hopeful: in the rearing of exceptional men.","Our treasure lies in the beehive of our knowledge. We are perpetually on the way thither, being by nature winged insects and honey gatherers of the mind.","Every week we ought to have one hour for recieving letters, then go take a bath.","There are two things a real man likes - danger and play; and he likes woman because she is the most dangerous of play things.","There is no more dangerous error than that of mistaking the consequence for the cause.","Shackled heart, free spirit.--Whoever binds his heart tightly and imprisons it may indulge his spirit in many liberties: I have already said that once. But no one believes me unless he already knows.","I love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour, and who then asketh: \\"Am I a dishonest player?\\" - for he is willing to succumb.","All good things were formerly bad things; every original sin has turned into an original virtue.","When one is young, one venerates and despises without that art of nuances which constitutes the best gain of life, and it is only fair that one has to pay dearly for having assaulted men and things in this manner with Yes and No. Everything is arranged so that the worst of tastes, the taste for the unconditional, should be cruelly fooled and abused until a man learns to put a little art into his feelings and rather to risk trying even what is artificial \u2014 as the real artists of life do.","Instinct. When the house burns one forgets even lunch. Yes, but one eats it later in the ashes.","Mistrust those in whom the urge to punish is strong.","That whatever a man says, promises, or resolves in passion he must stick to later on when he is cold and sober--this demand is among the heaviest burdens that weigh on humankind.","A declaration of war on the masses by higher men is needed! ... Everything that makes soft and effeminate, that serves the end of the people or the feminine, works in favor of universal suffrage, i.e. the domination of the inferior men. But we should take reprisal and bring this whole affair to light and the bar of judgment.","If there were gods, how could I endure not to be a god? Therefore there are no gods.","Never trust a thought that didn\'t come by walking.","That which does not destroy, strengthens.","I understand by \'freedom of spirit\' something quite definite - the unconditional will to say No, where it is dangerous to say No.","My formula for happiness: a Yes, a No, a straight line, a goal.","Live dangerously. Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius.","Thus the will to power strives towards oppositions, towards displeasure. There is a will to suffering at the foundation of all organic life (contrary to \\"happiness\\" as \\"goal\\").","We come to recognize that playfulness, as a philosophical stance, can be very serious indeed; and moreover, that it possesses an unfailing capacity to arouse ridicule and hostility in those among us who crave certainty, reverence, and restraint.","It quite often happens that the old man is subject to the delusion of a great moral renewal and rebirth, and from this experience he passes judgments on the work and course of his life, as if he had only now become clear-sighted; and yet the inspiration behind this feeling of well-being and these confident judgements is not wisdom, but weariness .","On the tree, Future, we build our nest; and in our solitude eagles shall bring us nourishment in their beaks!","He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance; one cannot fly into flying.","If a woman seeks education it is probably because her sexual apparatus is malfunctioning.","Under conditions of peace the warlike man attacks himself.","Plato was a bore.","I could dispense with nothing when I created the superman. His seed still carries all your evil and falsehood, your lies and yourignorance.","Life without music is no life at all.","A Dionysian life task needs the hardness of the hammer and one of its first essentials is without doubt the joy to be found even in destruction.","We have no dreams at all or interesting ones. We should learn to be awake the same way- not at all or in an interesting manner","The text has disappeared under the interpretation.","Very early in my life I took the question of the relation of art to truth seriously: even now I stand in holy dread in the face of this discordance. My first book was devoted to it. The Birth of Tragedy believes in art on the background of another belief","We are always in our own company.","From the State the exceptional individual cannot expect much. He is seldom benefited by being taken into its service; the only certain advantage it can give him is complete independence. Only real culture will prevent him being too early tired out or used up, and will spare him the exhausting struggle against culture-philistinism.","When I was twelve years old I thought up an odd trinity: namely, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Devil. My inference wasthat God, in contemplating himself, created the second person of the godhead; but that, in order to be able to contemplate himself, he had to contemplate, and thus to create, his opposite.--With this I began to do philosophy.","I notice that Autumn is more the season of the soul than of nature.","In every party there is one person who, through his dotingly credulous enunciation of party principles, incites the other members to defection.","In the knowledge of truth, what really matters is the possession of it, not the impulse under which it was sought.","I am Zarathustra the Godless: where shall I find my equal? All those who give themselves their own will and renounce all submission, they are my equals.","How is freedom measured, in individuals as in nations? By the resistance which has to be overcome, by the effort it costs to stay aloft. One would have to seek the highest type of free man where the greatest resistance is constantly being overcome: five steps from tyranny, near the threshold of the danger of servitude.","What if God were not exactly truth, and if this could be proved? And if he were instead the vanity, the desire for power, the ambitions, the fear, and the enraptured and terrified folly of mankind?","And we should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once. And we should call every truth false which was not accompanied by at least one laugh.","Love matches, so called, have illusion for their father and need for their mother.","Man Is Something That Must Be Overcome","The creation of freedom for oneself and a sacred \\"No\\" even to duty -- for that, my brothers, the lion is needed.","We have art in order not to die of the truth.","It was Christianity which first painted the devil on the worlds walls; It was Christianity which first brought sin into the world. Belief in the cure which it offered has now been shaken to it\'s deepest roots; but belief in the sickness which it taught and propagated continues to exists.","The bad gains respect through imitation, the good loses it especially in art.","Idleness is the beginning of all psychology. What? Could it be that psychology is ? a vice?","All philosophers make the common mistake of taking contemporary man as their starting point and of trying, through an analysis of him, to[21] reach a conclusion. \\"Man\\" involuntarily presents himself to them as an aeterna veritas as a passive element in every hurly-burly, as a fixed standard of things. Yet everything uttered by the philosopher on the subject of man is, in the last resort, nothing more than a piece of testimony concerning man during a very limited period of time.","Could one count such dilettantes and old spinsters as that mawkish apostle of virginity, Mainlander, as a genuine German? In the last analysis he probably was a Jew (all Jews become mawkish when they moralize).","The tragedy is that we cannot believe the dogmas of religion and metaphysics if we have the strict methods of truth in heart and head, but on the other hand, we have become through the development of humanity so tenderly suffering that we need the highest kind of means of salvation and consolation: whence arises the danger that man may bleed to death through the truth that he realises.","Once and for all, there are many things I choose not to know.--Wisdom sets limits even to knowledge.","Scholars who become politicians are usually assigned the comic role of having to be the good conscience of state policy.","A person must have a good memory to keep the promises he has made. A person must have a strong imagination to be able to have pity. So closely is morality tied to the quality of the intellect.","This is the manner of noble souls: they do not want to have anything for nothing; least of all, life. Whoever is of the mob wants to live for nothing; we others, however, to whom life gave itself, we always think about what we might best give in return... One should not wish to enjoy where one does not give joy.","The most general deficiency in our sort of culture and education is gradually dawning on me: no one learns, no one strives towards, no one teaches--enduring loneliness.","Christianity has taken the part of all the weak, the low, the botched; it has made an ideal out of antagonism to all the self preservative instincts of sound life; it has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest intellectual values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation.","All credibility, all good conscience, all evidence of truth come only from the senses.","All signs of superhuman nature appear in man as illness or insanity.","In every age the wisest have passed the identical judgment on life: it is worthless.","When you gaze long into the Abyss of Sustainability, the Abyss of Sustainability also gazes into you.","Immature is the love of the youth, and immature his hatred of man and earth. His mind and the wings of his spirit are still tied down and heavy.","Those that achieve anything that looks beyond the vision and thinking of their peers provoke jealousy and hatred disguised as the ordinary.","Blessed are the forgetful: for they get the better even of their blunders.","I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus is his head only the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth his down-going.","Only where there are graves are there resurrections.","Man would sooner have the Void for his purpose than be void of Purpose.","It is the stillest words that bring the storm.","I obviously do everything to be \\"hard to understand\\" myself","He who thinks a great deal is not suited to be a party man: he thinks his way through the party and out the other side too soon.","It is hard enough to remember my opinions, without also remembering my reasons for them!","\\"What is good?\\" ye ask. To be brave is good. Let the little girls say: \\"To be good is what is pretty, and at the same time touching.\\"","At a certain place in Beethoven\'s Ninth Symphony, for example, he might feel that he is floating above the earth in a starry dome, with the dream of immortality in his heart; all the stars seem to glimmer around him, and the earth seems to sink ever deeper downwards.","The higher culture an individual attains, the less field there is left for mockery and scorn.","From which stars have we fallen to meet each other here?","A living being seeks, above all, to discharge its strength. Life is will to power.","The world is poor for him who has never been sick enough for this \'voluptuousness of hell","We must remain as close to the flowers, the grass, and the butterflies as the child is who is not yet so much taller than they are.","The finest and healthiest thing about science is, as in the mountains, the brisk air blowing around in it.--The spiritually delicate (such as artists) shun and slander science owing to this air.","I still live, I still think: I still have to live, for I still have to think.","We possess art lest we perish of the truth.","Insects sting, not from malice, but because they want to live. It is the same with critics; they desire our blood not our pain.","The Hour-Hand of Life --- Life consists of rare, isolated moments of the greatest significance, and of innumerably many intervals, during which at best the silhouettes of those moments hover about us. Love, springtime, every beautiful melody, mountains, the moon, the sea - all these speak completely to the heart but once, if in fact they ever do get a chance to speak completely. For many men do not have those moments at all, and are themselves intervals and intermissions in the symphony of real life.","In the stream.- Mighty waters draw much stone and rubble along with them; mighty spirits many stupid and bewildered heads.","Wit is the epitaph of an emotion.","Even the pluckiest among us has but seldom the courage of what he really knows.","To die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly. Death freely chosen, death at the right time, brightly and cheerfully accomplished amid children and witnesses: then a real farewell is still possible, as the one who is taking leave is still there; also a real estimate of what one has wished, drawing the sum of one\'s life--all in opposition to the wretched and revolting comedy that Christianity has made of the hour of death.","In a man devoted to knowledge, pity seems almost ridiculous, like delicate hands on a cyclops.","The golden fleece of self-sufficiency guards against cudgel- blows but not against pin-pricks.","We should turn our death into a celebration, even if only out of a malice towards life: towards the woman who wants to leave--us!","We evaluate the services that anyone renders to us according to the value he puts on them, not according to the value they have for us.","We should be a mirror of being: we are God in miniature.","That God became man indicates only this: that man should not seek his salvation in eternity, but rather establish his heaven on earth.","Pathetic attitudes are not in keeping with greatness.","One must give value to their existence by behaving as if ones very existence were a work of art.","We are most unfair to God; we do not allow Him to sin.","I know my fate. One day my name will be tied to the memory of something monstrous - a crisis without equal on earth.... I am no man, I am dynamite!","He who is dissatisfied with himself is continually ready for revenge and we others will be his victims, if only in having always to endure his ugly sight. For the sight of the ugly makes one bad and gloomy.","A vocation is the backbone of life.","The doer alone learneth.","Whom do I hate most among the rabble of today? The socialist rabble, the chandala apostles, who undermine the instinct, the pleasure, the worker\'s sense of satisfaction with his small existence-who make him envious, who teach him revenge. The source of wrong is never unequal rights but the claim of \\"equal\\" rights.","I shall repeat a hundred times; we really ought to free ourselves from the seduction of words!","Perhaps no philosopher is more correct than the cynic. The happiness of the animal, that thorough cynic, is the living proof of cynicism.","No shepherd and one herd! Everybody wants the same, everybody is the same: whoever feels different goes voluntarily into a madhouse.","How much rationality and higher protection there is in such self-deception, and how much falseness I still require in order to allow myself again and again the luxury of my sincerity.","You are rewarding a teacher poorly if you remain always a pupil.","Our vanity is hardest to wound precisely when our pride has just been wounded.","Let old ones go. Dont be a memory-monger! Once you were young\u2500\u2500now you are even younger.","What separates two people most profoundly is a different sense and degree of cleanliness.","The most unambiguous sign that a person holds men in low esteem is this, that he either acknowledges them merely as means to his ends or does not acknowledge them at all.","Different types of dangerous lives-You have no idea what you are living through; you rush through life as if you were drunk and now and then fall down some staircase. But thanks to your drunkenness you never break a limb; your muscles are too relaxed and your brain too benighted for you to find the stones of these stairs as hard as we do.","What is life? A continuous praise and blame.","The worst readers are those who behave like plundering troops: they take away a few things they can use, dirty and confound the remainder, and revile the whole.","When we stand the truth on its head we generally fail to notice that our head is not standing where it should be standing either.","No one lies so boldly as the man who is indignant.","There are men who desire power simply for the sake of the happiness it will bring; these belong chiefly to political parties.","As an artist one has no home in Europe except in Paris.","I will make an attempt to attain freedom, the youthful soul says to itself; and is it to be hindered in this by the fact that two nations happen to hate and fight one another, or that two continents are separated by an ocean, or that all around it a religion is taught with did not yet exist a couple of thousand years ago. All that is not you, it says to itself.","The irrationality of a thing is no argument against its existence, rather a condition of it.","There is nothing very odd about lambs disliking birds of prey, but this is no reason for holding it against large birds of prey that they carry off lambs. And when the lambs whisper among themselves, \\"These birds of prey are evil, and does this not give us a right to say that whatever is the opposite of a bird of prey must be good,\\" there is nothing intrinsically wrong with such an argument-though the birds of prey will look somewhat quizzically and say, We have nothing against these good lambs; in fact, we love them; nothing tastes better than a tender lamb.","Mystical explanations are thought to be deep; the truth is that they are not even shallow.","The hypocrite who always plays one and the same part ceases at last to be a hypocrite.","Every man is a creative cause of what happens, a primum mobile with an original movement.","The grand style arises when beauty wins a victory over the monstrous.","Modern science has as its object as little pain as possible, as long a life as possible - hence a sort of eternal blessedness, but of a very limited kind in comparison with the promises of religion.","An artist chooses his subjects: that is the way he praises.","Those who know that they are profound strive for clarity. Those who would like to seem profound to the crowd strive for obscurity. For the crowd believes that if it cannot see to the bottom of something it must be profound. It is so timid and dislikes going into the water.","Success has always been the greatest liar - and the \\"work\\" itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer is disguised by his creations, often beyond recognition; the \\"work,\\" whether of the artist or the philosopher, invents the man who has created it, who is supposed to have create it; \\"great men,\\" as they are venerated, are subsequent pieces of wretched minor fiction","Strong currents drag many stones and bushes along with them, strong intellects many dense and muddled minds.","Man is the cruelest animal. At tragedies, bullfights, and crucifixions he has so far felt best on earth; and when he invented hell for himself, behold, that was his very heaven.","The doctrine of equality! ... But there is no more venomous poison in existence: for it appears to be preached by justice itself, when it is actually the end of justice ... \\"Equality to the equal; inequality to the unequal\\" that would be true justice speaking: and its corollary, \\"never make the unequal equal\\".","God remains dead. And we have killed him. Yet his shadow still looms. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?","Let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life. The living being is only a species of the dead, and a very rare species.","I love him who chasteneth his God, because he loveth his God: for he must succumb through the wrath of his God.","We belong to an age whose culture is in danger of perishing through the means to culture.","A philosophical mythology lies concealed in language, which breaks out again at every moment, no matter how cautious we may be.","We have no organ at all for knowledge, for truth: we know (or believe or imagine) precisely as much as may be useful in the interest of the human herd, the species: and even what is here called usefulness is in the end only a belief, something imagined and perhaps precisely that most fatal piece of stupidity by which we shall one day perish.","Behold! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that has gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it from me. I wish to spread it and bestow it, until the wise have once more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.","One is honest about oneself either with a sense of shame or with vanity.","The object of convalescence ought to be to turn our attention to life: at other times, simply to our tasks!","Here is a hero who did nothing but shake the tree as soon as the fruit was ripe. Does this seem to be too small a thing to you? Then take a good look at the tree he shook.","To those human beings who are of any concern to me, I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill treatment, indignities, profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, and the wretchedness of the vanquished.","Where one despises, one cannot wage war.","We are, indeed, not among the least contented. You, however, if your belief makes you blessed then appear to be blessed! Your faces have always been more injurious to your belief than our objections have! If these glad tidings of your Bible were written on your faces, you would not need to insist so obstinately on the authority of that book ... As things are, however, all your apologies for Christianity have their roots in your lack of Christianity; with your defense plea you inscribe your own bill of indictment.","Not doubt, certainty is what drives one insane.","The superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the superman is to be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, be true to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! They are poisoners, whether they know it or not.","The code of Manu differs from the bible. By means of it the nobles, the philosophers, and the warriors keep the whip hand over the majority. It is full of noble valuations; it shows a feeling of perfection, an acceptance of life, and triumphant feeling toward self and life.","Principle of \\"Christian love\\": it insists upon being well paid in the end.","One does not want to be deceived, under the supposition that it is injurious, dangerous, or fatal to be deceived.","If thinking is your fate, revere this fate with divine honour and sacrifice to it the best, the most beloved","Being human is a complicated gig. So give that ol\' dark night of the soul a hug. Howl the eternal yes!","One must not let oneself be misled: they say \'Judge not!\' but they send to Hell everything that stands in their way.","There are people who want to make men\'s lives more difficult for no other reason than the chance it provides them afterwards to offer their prescription for alleviating life; their Christianity, for instance.","We have to learn how to come out of unclean situations cleaner than we were, and even how to wash ourselves with dirty water whenwe need to.","Full is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life by the many-too-many. May they be decoyed out of this life by the \\"life eternal\\"!","How little is required for pleasure! The sound of a bagpipe - without music, life would be an error.","Every church is a stone on the grave of a god-man: it does not want him to rise up again under any circumstances.","The Devil has the broadest perspectives for God; therefore, he keeps so far away from God -- the Devil being the most ancient friend of wisdom","Subordination to morality can be slavish or vain or self- interested or resigned or gloomily enthusiastic or thoughtless or an act of despair, just as subordination to a prince can be: in itself it is nothing moral.","People live for the morrow, because the day-after-to-morrow is doubtful.","The misunderstanding of passion and reason, as if the latter were an independent entity and not rather a system of relations between various passions and desires; and as if every passion did not possess its quantum of reason.","The love of one sole being is a barbarism; for it will be employed to the detriment of all the rest. So too the love of God.","At one time or another, almost every politician needs an honest man so badly that, like a ravenous wolf, he breaks into a sheep-fold: not to devour the ram he has stolen, however, but rather to conceal himself behind its wooly back.","A physician who treated me as a nervous case for a while said in the end \\"No! It is not a matter of your nerves; it is I who am nervous\\".","Priests ... these turkey-cocks of God.","The world itself is the will to power - and nothing else! And you yourself are the will to power - and nothing else!","Posthumous men-myself, for example-are not as well understood as timely ones, but we are listened to better. More precisely: we are never understood-hence our authority.","Talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself.","The only excuse for God is that he doesn\'t exist.","The last Christian died on a cross.","He who fights too long against dragons becomes a dragon himself; and if you gaze too long into the abyss, the abyss will gaze into you.","Where the good begins.- Where the poor power of the eye can no longer see the evil impulse as such because it has become too subtle, man posits the realm of goodness; and the feeling that we have now entered the realm of goodness excites all those impulses which had been threatened and limited by the evil impulses, like the feeling of security, of comfort, of benevolence. Hence, the duller the eye, the more extensive the good. Hence the eternal cheerfulness of the common people and of children. Hence the gloominess and grief - akin to a bad conscience - of the great thinkers.","We ought to learn from the kine one thing: ruminating.","Historical refutation as the definitive refutation.- In former times, one sought to prove that there is no God - today one indicates how the belief that there is a God arose and how this belief acquired its weight and importance: a counter-proof that there is no God thereby becomes superfluous.- When in former times one had refuted the \'proofs of the existence of God\' put forward, there always remained the doubt whether better proofs might not be adduced than those just refuted: in those days atheists did not know how to make a clean sweep.","Egoism is the law of perspective applied to feelings: what is closest appears large and weighty, and as one moves farther away size and weight decrease.","To die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly. Death of one\'s own free choice, death at the proper time, with a clear head and with joyfulness, consummated in the midst of children and witnesses: so that an actual leave-taking is possible while he who is leaving is still there.","Creation is the great redemption from suffering and all life\'s growing light. But the creator must be suffering if needed and accept much change.","The great advantage in noble parentage is that enables one to endure poverty more easily.","Everyone who enjoys supposes that the tree was concerned with the fruit,  but it was really concerned with the seed. -In this lies the difference between all those who create and those who enjoy.","What is happening to me happens to all fruits that grow ripe. It is the honey in my veins that makes my blood thicker, and my soul quieter.","If it is true to say of the lazy that they kill time, then it is greatly to be feared that an era which sees its salvation in public opinion, this is to say private laziness, is a time that really will be killed: I mean that it will be struck out of the history of the true liberation of life. How reluctant later generations will be to have anything to do with the relics of an era ruled, not by living men, but by pseudo-men dominated by public opinion.","He who is punished is never he who performed the deed. He is always the scapegoat.","In architecture the pride of man, his triumph over gravitation, his will to power, assume a visible form. Architecture is a sort of oratory of power by means of forms.","So long as the priest, that professional negator, slanderer and poisoner of life, is regarded as a superior type of human being, there cannot be any answer to the question: What is Truth?","My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be other than it is, not in the future, not in the past, not in all eternity.","A light has dawned for me: I need companions, living ones, not dead companions and corpses which I carry with me wherever I wish. But I need living companions who follow me because they want to follow themselves- and who want to go where I want to go.","Now we will no longer concede so easily that anyone has the truth; the rigorous methods of inquiry have spread sufficient distrust and caution, so that we experience every man who represents opinions violently in word and deed as any enemy of our present culture, or at least as a backward person. And in fact, the fervor about having the truth counts very little today in relation to that other fervor, more gentle and silent, to be sure, for seeking the truth, a search that does not tire of learning afresh and testing anew.","There exists no more repulsive and desolate creature in the world than the man who has evaded his genius and who now looks furtively to left and right, behind him and all about him. ... He is wholly exterior, without kernel, a tattered, painted bag of clothes.","All contempt for the sexual life, all denigration under the concept \'impure\\" is the essential crime against Life- against the Holy Spirit of Life\\".","Every great love brings with it the cruel idea of killing the object of its love so that it may be removed once and for all from the wicked game of change: for love dreads change even more than annihilation.","The magnitude of a progress is gauged by the greatness of the sacrifice that it requires.","We are responsible to ourselves for our own existence; consequently we want to be the true helmsman of this existence and refuse to allow our existence to resemble a mindless act of chance.","Partial knowledge is more triumphant than complete knowledge; it takes things to be simpler than they are, and so makes its theory more popular and convincing.","truths are illusions of which one has forgotten that they are illusions, metaphors that have become worn-out and deprived of their sensuous force, coins that have lost their imprint and are now no longer seen as coins but as metal.","A labyrinthine man never seeks the truth, but only his Ariadne.","But tell me: how did gold get to be the highest value? Because it is uncommon and useless and gleaming and gentle in its brilliance; it always gives itself. Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold get to be the highest value. The giver\'s glance gleams like gold. A golden brilliance concludes peace between the moon and the sun. Uncommon is the highest virtue and useless, it is gleaming and gentle in its brilliance: a gift-giving virtue is the highest virtue.","And like a wind shall I one day blow amongst them and with my spirit take away their soul\'s breath: thus my future wills it.","Man\'s maturity: to have regained the seriousness that he had as a child at play.","Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood.","History belongs above all to the man...who needs models, teachers, comforters and cannot find them among his contemporaries.","You implanted your highest goal into the heart of those passions: then they became your virtues and joys.","For such is man: a Theological Dogma might be refuted to him a thousand times - provided however, that he had need of it, he would again and again accept it as true. Belief is always most desired, most pressingly needed where there is a lack of will. Fanaticism is the sole \\"volitional strength\\" to which the weak and irresolute can be excited, as a sort of hypnotising of the entire sensory-intellectual system.","Many people, especially women, never experience boredom because they have never learned to work properly.","The most spiritual human beings, assuming they are the most courageous, also experience by far the most painful tragedies: but it is precisely for this reason that they honor life, because it brings against them its most formidable weapons.","At times one remains faithful to a cause only because its opponents do not cease to be insipid.","Speaking generally, punishment hardens and numbs, it produces concentration, it sharpens the consciousness of alienation, it strengthens the power of resistance.","For one thing is needful: that a human being should attain satisfaction with himself, whether it be by means of this or that poetry or art; only then is a human being at all tolerable to behold. Whoever is dissatisfied with himself is constantly ready for revenge, and we others will be his victims, if only by having to endure his ugly sight.","The rights which a man arrogates to himself are relative to the duties which he sets himself, and to the tasks which he feels capable of performing.","Indeed, what forces us at all to suppose that there is an essential opposition of \'true\' and \'false\'? Is it not sufficient to assume degrees of apparentness and, as it were, lighter and darker shadows and shades of appearance- different \'values\', to use the language of painters?","The great end of art is to strike the imagination with the power of a soul that refuses to admit defeat even in the midst of a collapsing world.","The living is merely a type of what is dead, and a very rare type.","I wish to be at any time hereafter only a yea-sayer!","The love of indulgence is rooted in the depths of a man\'s heart. His soul would prefer to share the excessive and unrestrained; but his soul cannot love.","I presume that you are compassionate: to be without pity means to be sick in body and spirit. But one should have spirit in abundance, so as to be permitted to be compassionate! For your pity is detrimental to you and to everyone.","A lack of the historical sense is the hereditary fault of all philosophers.","If one uses one\'s intellect to become master over the unlimited emotions, it may produce a sorry and diversionary effect upon the intellect.","Along the journey we commonly forget its goal. Almost every vocation is chosen and entered upon as a means to a purpose but is ultimately continued as a final purpose in itself. Forgetting our objectives is the most frequent stupidity in which we indulge ourselves.","The English are the people of consummate cant.","We are doubly willing to jump into the water after some one who has fallen in, if there are people present who have not the courage to do so.","Undeserved praise causes more pangs of conscience later than undeserved blame, but probably only for this reason, that our power of judgment are more completely exposed by being over praised than by being unjustly underestimated.","We do not by any means think it desirable that the kingdom of righteousness and peace should be established on earth (because under any circumstances it would be the kingdom of the profoundest mediocrity and Chinaism); we rejoice in all men, who like ourselves love danger, war and adventure, who do not make compromises, nor let themselves be captured, conciliated and stunted; we count ourselves among the conquerors; we ponder over the need of a new order of things, even of a new slavery for every strengthening and elevation of the type \\"man\\" also involves a new form of slavery.","In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very remarkable man.","There are ages in which the rational man and the intuitive man stand side by side, the one in fear of intuition, the other with scorn for abstraction. The latter is just as irrational as the former is inartistic.","Learning from one\'s enemies is the best way to love them, for it puts one into a grateful mood toward them.","What was formerly merely sickly now becomes indecent : it is indecent to be a Christian today.","Emerson is a person who lives instinctively on ambrosia - and leaves everything indigestible on his plate.","Let us guard against saying that there are laws in nature. There are merely necessities: there is no one who commands, no one whoobeys, no one who transgresses. Once you understand that there are no purposes, then you also understand that nothing is accidental: for it is only in a world of purposes that the word \\"accident\\" makes sense.","Pity is the most pleasant feeling in those who have not much pride and have no prospect of great conquests; for them the easy prey - and that is what all who suffer are - is enchanting.","Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing.","Help thyself: then everyone will help thee too. Principle of Christian charity.","Free from what? What does that matter to Zarathustra! Clearly, however, shall your eye show to me: free for what?","I could only believe in a God who could dance... And now a God dances through me.","Here one must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness: life itself is essentially appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest, exploitation - but why should one for ever use precisely these words on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped?","Free will appears unfettered, deliberate; it is boundlessly free, wandering, the spirit. But fate is a necessity; unless we believe that world history is a dream-error, the unspeakable sorrows of mankind fantasies, and that we ourselves are but the toys of our fantasies. Fate is the boundless force of opposition against free will. Free will without fate is just as unthinkable as spirit without reality, good without evil. Only antithesis creates the quality.","Not necessity, not desire - no, the love of power is the demon of men. Let them have everything - health, food, a place to live, entertainment - they are and remain unhappy and low-spirited: for the demon waits and waits and will be satisfied.","Whatever does not kill me makes me stronger.","A matter that becomes clear ceases to concern us.","He who humbles himself wants to be exalted.","Underneath the reality in which we live and have our being, another altogether different reality lies concealed.","In music the passions enjoy themselves.","What is good? All that enhances the feeling of power, the Will to Power, and power itself in man. What is bad? \u2014 All that proceeds from weakness. What is happiness? \u2014 The feeling that power is increasing \u2014 that resistance has been overcome.","The desire for a strong faith is not the proof of a strong faith, rather the opposite. If one has it one may permit oneself the beautiful luxury of skepticism: one is secure enough, fixed enough for it.","There is only a perspective seeing, only a perspective \'knowing\'; and the more affects we allow to speak about one thing, the more eyes, different eyes, we can use to observe one thing, the more complete will our \'concept\' of this thing, our \'objectivity,\' be.","How I understand the philosopher - as a terrible explosive, endangering everthing... my concept of the philosopher is worlds removed from any concept that would include even a Kant, not to speak of academic \\"ruminants\\" and other professors of philosophy.","And this do I call immaculate perception of all things: to want nothing else from them, but to be allowed to lie before them as a mirror with a hundred facets.","In every philosophical school, three thinkers succeed one another in the following way: the first produces out of himself the sapand seed, the second draws it out into threads and spins a synthetic web, and the third waits in this web for the sacrificial victims that are caught in it--and tries to live off philosophy.","And so, onwards... along a path of wisdom, with a hearty tread, a hearty confidence.. however you may be, be your own source of experience. Throw off your discontent about your nature. Forgive yourself your own self. You have it in your power to merge everything you have lived through- false starts, errors, delusions, passions, your loves and your hopes- into your goal, with nothing left over.","Women are quite able to make friends with a man; but to preserve such a friendship - that no doubt requires the assistance of a slight physical antipathy","Against war one might say that it makes the victor stupid and the vanquished malicious. In its favor, that in producing these two effects it barbarizes, and so makes the combatants more natural. For culture it is a sleep or a wintertime, and man emerges from it stronger for good and for evil.","In constructing concepts, we overlook the fact that no two things are the same. There is no such thing as the concept of a leaf, only billions and billions of leaves.","Nihilism: any aim is lacking, any answer to the question \\"why\\" is lacking. What does nihilism mean?--that the supreme values devaluate themselves.","Your highest thought, however, ye shall have it commanded unto you by me - and it is this: man is something that is to be surpassed.","Aphorisms should be peaks - and those who are addressed, tall and lofty. The air thin and pure, danger near, and the spirit full of gay sarcasm: these go well together.","Do you call yourself Free? It is your ruling thought that I would hear, and not that you have escaped from a yoke.","Truth is a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, anthropomorphisms, in short a sum of human relations which have been subjected to poetic and rhetorical intensification, translation and decoration [\u2026]; truths are illusions of which we have forgotten that they are illusions, metaphors which have become worn by frequent use and have lost all sensuous vigour [\u2026]. Yet we still do not know where the drive to truth comes from, for so far we have only heard about the obligation to be truthful which society imposes in order to exist\\" from, \\"On Truth and Lying in a Non-Moral Sense\\".","Only sick music makes money today.","We ought to face our destiny with courage.","The ordinary man is as courageous and invulnerable as a hero when he does not recognize any danger, when he has no eyes to see it.Conversely, the hero\'s only vulnerable spot is on his back, and so exactly where he has no eyes.","God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed him.","The snake which cannot cast its skin has to die.","But thus do I counsel you, my friends: distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful! Distrust all those who talk much of their justice!","Vanity is the fear of appearing original: it is thus a lack of pride, but not necessarily a lack of originality.","What do I care about the purring of one who cannot love, like the cat?","One loves ultimately one\'s desires, not the thing desired.","Wisdom sets bounds even to knowledge.","Jesus died too soon. If he had lived to my age he would have repudiated his doctrine.","On the mountains of truth you can never climb in vain: either you will reach a point higher up today, or you will be training your powers so that you will be able to climb higher tomorrow.","Good writers have two things in common: they prefer to be understood rather than admired; and they do not write for knowing and over-acute readers.","Creating-that is the great salvation from suffering, and life\'s alleviation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much transformation.","The essential thing \u2018in heaven and earth\u2019 is that there should be a long obedience in the same direction; there thereby results, and has always resulted in the long run, something which has made life worth living.","Distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful.","Physiologists should think before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being. A living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength--life itself is will to power; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent results.","One begins to mistrust very clever people when they become embarrassed.","All sciences are now under the obligation to prepare the ground for the future task of the philosopher, which is to solve the problem of value, to determine the true hierarchy of values.","Ultimately one loves one\'s desires and not that which is desired.","Man is not equally moral at all hours, this is well known. If his morality is judged to be the capability for great self-sacrificing resolutions and self-denial (which, when continuous and grown habitual, are called holiness)","Moderation sees itself as beautiful; it is unaware that in the eye of the immoderate it appears black and sober and consequently ugly-looking.","What doesn\'t kill you, only makes you stronger","no one talks more passionately about his rights than he who in the depths of his soul doubts whether he has any","He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. Is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves?","Just look at the faces of the great Christians! They are the faces of great haters.","One day soon you will meet a man, and he will rise like a phoenix from the ashes, and it is my greatest hope that he will not give you syphilis.","Liberalism is the transformation of mankind into cattle.","Around the hero everything turns into a tragedy, around the demigod, a satyr-play, and around God--what? perhaps a \\"world\\"?","Behold, I am weary of my wisdom,\\n like a bee that has gathered too much honey;\\n I need hands outstretched to receive it.","So long as the spectator has to figure out the meaning of this or that person, or the presuppositions of this or that conflict of inclinations and purposes, he cannot become completely absorbed in the activities and sufferings of the chief characters or feel breathless pity and fear.","A man who possesses genius is insufferable unless he also possesses at least two other things: gratitude and cleanliness.","How much disgruntled heaviness, lameness, dampness, how much beer is there in the German intelligence.","I want to know whether you are a person devoted to creating or to exchanging in some respect or other: as a creator you belong tothe free, as an exchanger you are their slave and instrument.","Democratic institutions form a system of quarantine for tyrannical desires.","You I advise not to work, but to fight. You I advise not to peace, but to victory. Let your work be a fight, let your peace be a victory!","A vocation makes us unthinking; that is its greatest blessing. For it is a bulwark behind which we are permitted to withdraw whencommonplace doubts and cares assail us.","A heart full of courage and cheerfulness needs a little danger from time to time, or the world gets unbearable.","No artist will tolerate the world for one second as it is.","In pain there is as much wisdom as in pleasure: like the latter it is one of the best self preservatives of a species.","What is originality? To see something that is as yet without a name, that is as yet impossible to designate, even though it staresus in the face. The way it usually is with people, it is a thing\'s name that makes it perceptible to them in the first place.--For the most part, the original ones have also been the name-givers.","Pharisaism is not a degeneration in a good man: a large portion of it is rather the condition of all being-good.","One must never have spared oneself, one must have acquired hardness as a habit to be cheerful and in good spirits in the midst of nothing but hard truths.","Man is something that is to be surpassed.","Your god is dead and only the ignorant weep. And if you claim there is a hell, then we shall meet there!","Man is more ape than many of the apes.","The trodden worm curls up. This testifies to its caution. It thus reduces its chances of being trodden upon again. In the language of morality: Humility.","A person unlearns arrogance when he knows he is always among worthy human beings; being alone fosters presumption. Young people are arrogant because they always associate with their own peers, those who are all really nothing but who would like to be very important.","While every noble morality develops from a triumphant affirmation of itself, slave morality from the outset says No to what is \\"outside,\\" what is \\"different,\\" what is \\"not itself\\"; and this No is its creative deed.","It has therewith come to be recognized that the history of moral valuations is at the same time the history of an error, the error of responsibility, which is based upon the error of the freedom of will.","The Greeks, with their truly healthy culture, have once and for all justified philosophy simply by having engaged in it, and having engaged in it more fully than any other people.","In every ascetic morality man worships a part of himself as God and for that he needs to diabolize the other part.","If you have an enemy, do not requite him evil with good, for that would put him to shame. Rather prove that he did you some good.","Happiness is the feeling that power increases - that resistance is being overcome.","We must remain as close to the flowers, the grass, and the butterflies as the child is who is not yet so much taller than they are. We adults, on the other hand, have outgrown them and have to lower ourselves to stoop down to them. It seems to me that the grass hates us when we confess our love for it. Whoever would partake of all good things must understand how to be small at times.","I would only believe in a god who could dance. And when I saw my devil I found him serious, thorough, profound, and solemn: it was the spirit of gravity\u2014through him all things fall. Not by wrath does one kill but by laughter. Come, let us kill the spirit of gravity!","When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one\'s feet. This morality is by no means self-evident. Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole. It stands or falls with faith in God.","Scholarship has the same relationship to wisdom as righteousness has to holiness: it is cold and dry, it is loveless and knows nodeep feelings of inadequacy or longing.","The coward does not know what it means to be alone: an enemy is always standing behind his chair.","Faith makes blessed.  Consequently it lies.","The noble soul reveres itself","The greater the obstacle the more glory in overcoming it. -  What does not destroy makes me stronger.","Once the decision has been made, close your ear even to the best counter argument: sign of a strong character. Thus an occasional will to stupidity.","One is not converted to christianity; one must be morbid enough for it.","The most common lie is that which one lies to himself; lying to others is relatively an exception.","Although the most acute judges of the witches and even the witches themselves, were convinced of the guilt of witchery, the guilt nevertheless was non-existent. It is thus with all guilt.","That which intoxicates, the sensually ecstatic, the sudden surprise, the urge to be profoundly stirred at any price -- dreadful tendencies!","He who does not lie does not know what truth is.","Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too young\u2014so have patience with it!","Sharp and mild, dull and keen, well known and strange, dirty and clean, where both the fool and wise are seen: All this am I, have ever been, - in me dove, snake and swine convene!","I might believe in the Redeemer if his followers looked more redeemed.","Freedom is the will to be responsible for ourselves.","The bite of conscience, like the bite of a dog into a stone, is a stupidity.","There is always a certain noise in applause: even in the applause we give ourselves.","The believer in magic and miracles reflects on how to impose a law on nature--: and, in brief, the religious cult is the outcome of this reflection.","The people we keep standing in the anteroom of our favor either start fermenting or turn sour.","The more a person indulges himself the less others are willing to indulge him.","Acknowledge your will and speak to us all, \\"This alone is what I will to be!\\" Hang your own penal code up above you: we want to be its enforcers!","Then is what you see through this window onto the world so lovely that you have no desire whatsoever to look out through any other window, and that you even make an attempt to prevent others from doing so?","There is not enough religion in the world even to destroy religion.","Man is more sensitive to the contempt that others feel towards him than to the contempt that he feels towards himself.","Show me that you are redeemed, and I will believe in your Redeemer.","Every attainment, every step forward in knowledge, follows from courage, from hardness against oneself, from cleanliness in relation to oneself.","as though \\"the Truth\\" were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors!","We would not let ourselves be burned to death for our opinions: we are not sure enough of them for that.","There is no pre-established harmony between the furtherance of truth and the well-being of mankind.","In the end we are always rewarded for our good will, our patience, fair-mindedness, and gentleness with what is strange.","Human existence basically is\u2500\u2500a never to be completed imperfect tense.","Man... cannot learn to forget, but hangs on the past: however far or fast he runs, that chain runs with him.","Light for some time to come will have to be called darkness.","One has to take a somewhat bold and dangerous line with this existence: especially as, whatever happens, we are bound to lose it.","Not contentment, but more power; not peace at any price, but war; not virtue, but efficiency (virtue in the Renaissance sense, virtu , virtue free of moral acid).","Christianity is religion for the executioner.","But this word will I say to my enemies: What is all manslaughter in comparison with what you have done to me!","You have not yet suffered enough! For you suffer only from yourselves, you have not yet suffered from man.","There cannot be a God because if there were one, I could not believe that I was not He.","Free will without fate is no more conceivable than spirit without matter, good without evil.","Unexplained, obscure matters are regarded as more important than explained, clear ones.","What good is all this free-thinking, modernity, and turncoat flexibility if at some gut level you are still a Christian, a Catholic, and even a priest!","Where there is happiness, there is found pleasure in nonsense. The transformation of experience into its opposite, of the suitable into the unsuitable, the obligatory into the optional (but in such a manner that this process produces no injury and is only imagined in jest), is a pleasure.","I cook every chance in my pot. And only when it is cooked through do I welcome it as my food.","A little health now and again is the ailing person\'s best remedy.","Truly, whoever possesses little is that much less possessed: praised be a little poverty!","We cannot live without valuing: but we can live without valuing what you value.","And he who must be a creator in good and evil: verily, he must be an annihilator first and demolish values.","Men are cowards when it comes to the \\"eternally feminine\\": and the little women know it.","A real fox calls sour not only those grapes that he cannot reach but also those that he has reached and taken away from others.","I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things:\u2014then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love from henceforth!","I mistrust all systematizers and avoid them. the will to a system is a lack of integrity.","What do we have in common with the rosebud, which trembles because a drop of dew lies on its body?","Every habit makes our hand more witty and our wit less handy.","The errors of great men are venerable because they are more fruitful than the truths of little men.","He who seeks intelligence lacks intelligence.","It is our needs that interpret the world; our drives and their For and Against. Every drive is a kind of lust to rule; each one has its perspective that it would like to compel all other drives to accept as a norm.","Christianity has a hunter\'s instinct for finding out all those who by one means or another may be driven to despair -although only a part of mankind is capable of such despair. Christianity lies in wait for such as those and pursues them","Parasitism is the only practice of the church; with its ideal of anaemia, its holiness, draining all blood, all love, all hope for life; the beyond as the will to negate every reality; the cross as the mark of recognition for the most subterranean conspiracy that ever existed-against health, beauty, whatever has turned out well, courage, spirit, graciousness of the soul, against life itself.","As is well known, the priests are the most evil enemies\u2014but why? Because they are the most impotent. It is because of their impotence that in them hatred grows to monstrous and uncanny proportions, to the most spiritual and poisonous kind of hatred. The truly great haters in world history have always been priests; likewise the most ingenious haters: other kinds of spirit hardly come into consideration when compared with the spirit of priestly vengefulness.","\\"God\\", \\"immortality of the soul\\", \\"redemption\\", \\"beyond\\" - Without exception, concepts to which I have never devoted any attention, or time; not even as a child. Perhaps I have never been childlike enough for them?\\nI do not by any means know atheism as a result; even less as an event: It is a matter of course with me, from instinct. I am too inquisitive, too questionable, too exuberant to stand for any gross answer. God is a gross answer, an indelicacy against us thinkers - at bottom merely a gross prohibition for us: you shall not think!","The great epochs of our life come when we gain the courage to rechristen our evil as what is best in us.","Christianity is called the religion of pity.","Everything is the same, nothing is worthwhile, the world is senseless, knowledge strangles.","There was at all events one advantage in the choice of this day to my birth; my birthday throughout the whole of my childhood was a day of public rejoicing.","A book full of brilliance imparts some of it even to its opponents.","It is nothing but fanaticism and beautiful soulism to expect very much (or even, much only) from humanity when it has forgotten how to wage war.","The preponderance of pain over pleasure is the cause of our fictitious morality and religion.","I have not come to know atheism as a result of logical reasoning and still less as an event in my life: in me it is a matter of instinct.","The devotion of the greatest is to encounter risk and danger, and play dice for death.","When a man is in love he endures more than at other times; he submits to everything.","Almost two thousand years, and no new god!","The man who does not wish to belong to the mass needs only to cease taking himself easily; let him follow his conscience, which calls to him: \\"Be your self! All you are now doing, thinking, desiring, is not you yourself.","For those who need consolation no means of consolation is so effective as the assertion that in their case no consolation is possible: it implies so great a degree of distinction that they at once hold up their heads again.","When gods die, they always die many sorts of death.","Every word is a preconceived judgment.","Dead are all gods: now we want the overman to live.","Art furnishes us with eyes and hands and above all the good conscience to be able to turn ourselves into such a phenomenon.","What does a philosopher demand of himself, first and last? To overcome his time in himself, to become \\"timeless.","When death brings at last the desired forgetfulness, it abolishes life and being together, and sets the seal on the knowledge that \\"being\\" is merely a continual \\"has been,\\" a thing that lives by denying and destroying and contradicting itself.","I have been casting shadows all my life without caring about how deeply they stain my soul.","Christians call it faith ... I call it the herd.","A book should long for pen, ink, and writing-table: but usually it is pen, ink, and writing-table that long for a book. That is why books are so negligible nowadays.","Quidquid luce fuit tenebris agit: but also the other way around. What we experience in dreams, so long as we experience it frequently, is in the end just as much a part of the total economy of our soul as anything we \\"really\\" experience: because of it we are richer or poorer, are sensitive to one need more or less, and are eventually guided a little by our dream-habits in broad daylight and even in the most cheerful moments occupying our waking spirit.","Not infrequently, we encounter copies of important human beings; and here, too, as in the case of paintings, most people prefer the copies to the originals.","Life is fountain of joy; but where the rabble also gather to drink, all wells are poisoned.","Modern marriage has lost its meaning--consequently it is being abolished.","We are in the greatest danger of being run over when we have just gotten out of the way of a carriage.","I too have been in the underworld, as was Odysseus, and I will often be there again; not only sheep have I sacrificed so as to beable to speak with a few dead souls, but neither have I spared my own blood as well.","We take a fancy to something: and scarcely have we thoroughly taken a fancy to it when that tyrant in us calls out: \\"Give me thatin sacrifice\\"--and we give it.","Of all evil I deem you capable: therefore I want the good from you.","All that philosophers have handled for millennia has been conceptual mummies; nothing actual has ever escaped from their hands alive.","Morality is: the mediocre are worth more than the exceptions ... I abhore Christianity with a deadly hatred.","One is proud to worship when he cannot be an idol.","We pay dearly for immortality: we die for it more than once during our lifetimes.","Rash actions are seldom committed in isolation. With the first rash action we always do too much. So we usually go on to commit asecond one--and then we do too little.","Our knowledge will take its revenge on us, just as ignorance exacted its revenge during the Middle Ages.","Compassion for the friend should conceal itself under a hard shell.","One has been a poor spectator of life if one has not witnessed the hand - that kills from mercy.","Natural death is independent of all reason and is really an irrational death, in which the pitiable substance of the shell determines how long the kernel is to exist or not; in which, accordingly, the stunted, diseased and dull witted jailer is lord, and indicates the moment at which his distinguished prisoner shall die.","It is not in our hands to prevent our birth; but we can correct this mistake - for in some cases it is a mistake.","The Christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity; it has turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie","Let man fear woman when she loves: then she makes any sacrifice, and everything else seems without value to her","Whether a man hides his bad qualities and vices or confesses them openly, his vanity wants to gain an advantage by it in both cases: just note how subtly he distinguishes between those he will hide his bad qualities from and those he will face honestly and candidly.","Whoever deliberately attempts to insure confidentiality with another person is usually in doubt as to whether he inspires that person\'s confidence in him. One who is sure that he inspires confidence attaches little importance to confidentiality.","One who is publicly honest about himself ends up by priding himself somewhat on this honesty: for he knows only too well why he is honest-for the same reasons another person prefers illusion and dissimulation.","Socrates and Plato are right: whatever man does he always does well, that is, he does that which seems to him good (useful) according to the degree of his intellect, the particular standard of his reasonableness.","The empty, the one, the unmoved, the full, satiation, wanting nothing--that would be my evil: in short, dreamless sleep.","\u201cEvil men have no songs.\u201d How is it, then, that the Russians have songs?","Like the creatures of the forest and the sea, I love To lose myself for a while.","Sleep is no mean art.","It is not things, but opinions about things that have absolutely no existence, which have so deranged mankind!","One must repay good and ill; but why just to the person who did us good or ill?","The advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to turn the beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of the doer.","Every philosophy is the philosophy of some stage of life.","We must be physicists in order to be creative since so far codes of values and ideals have been constructed in ignorance of physics or even in contradiction to physics.","Books for all the world are always foul-smelling books: the smell of small people clings to them.","Where neither love nor hatred is in the game, a woman\'s game is mediocre.","Man demands truth and fulfills this demand in moral intercourse with other men; this is the basis of all social life. One anticipates the unpleasant consequences of reciprocal lying. From this there arises the duty of truth. We permit epic poets to lie because we expect no detrimental consequences in this case. Thus the lie is permitted where it is considered something pleasant. Assuming that it does no harm, the lie is beautiful and charming.","However closely people are attached to one another, their mutual horizon nonetheless includes all four compass directions, and nowand again they notice it.","The sensible author writes for no other posterity than his own--that is, for his age--so as to be able even then to take pleasurein himself.","Many writers are neither spirit nor wine, but rather spirits- of-wine: they can catch fire, and then they give off heat.","From whatever you wish to know and measure you must take your leave, at least for a time. Only when you have left the town can yousee how high its towers rise above the houses.","Art depends upon the inexactitude of sight.","What do you believe in?--In this, that the weights of all things must be determined anew.","The humanity of famous intellectuals lies in being wrong with gracious courtesy when dealing with those who are not famous.","The apprentice and the master love the master in different ways.","Just as soon as we notice that someone has to force himself to pay attention when dealing and talking with us, we have a valid demonstration that he does not love us or that he does not love us anymore.","Loving and perishing: it\'s been a rhyme all these eternities. The will to love: that is, also being willing to die.","The surest sign that two people no longer speak the same language is that both say ironic things to one another but that neither senses the irony.","In our interactions with people, a benevolent hypocrisy is frequently required--acting as though we do not see through the motivesof their actions.","I am a prelude to better players, O my brothers! An example! Follow my example!","The scaffolding must be removed once the house is built.","For a significant man\\nwoman, the one thought he values greatly, to the laughter and scorn of insignificant men, is a key to hidden treasure chambers; for those others, it is nothing but a piece of old iron.","The melancholia of everything completed!","It is the powerful who know how to honour, it is their art, their domain for invention.","Only the most acute and active animals are capable of boredom.","A sedentary life is the real sin against the Holy Spirit. Only those thoughts that come by walking have any value.","In solitude the lonely man is eaten up by himself, among crowds by the many.","Let them like the Tibetans, chew the cud of their \\"om mane padme hum\\" innumerable times, or, as in Benares, count the name of the God Ram-Ram-Ram (etc. with or without charm) on their fingers; or honour Vishnu with his thousand names of invocation, Allah with his ninety-nine; or they may make use of the prayer-wheels and the rosary: the main thing is that they are settled down for a time at this work and are tolerable to look at. This kind of prayer has been invented for the benefit of the pious who have thought and elevations of their own.","It is thus only this personal feeling of misery that we get rid of by acts of pity.","To regard states of distress in general as an objection, as something which must be abolished is the greatest nonsense on earth; having the most disastrous consequences, fatally stupid- almost as stupid as a wish to abolish bad weather - out of pity for the poor.","Love ever your neighbour as yourselves - but first be such as love themselves.","What are man\'s truths ultimately? \\n Merely his irrefutable errors.","Was mich nicht zugrunde richtet, macht mich starker.","The heart and hand of those who always mete out become callous from always meting out.","As far as Germany extends it ruins culture.","Whenever the truth is uncovered, the artist will always cling with rapt gaze to what still remains covering even after such uncovering; but the theoretical man enjoys and finds satisfaction in the discarded covering and finds the highest object of his pleasure in the process of an ever happy uncovering that succeeds through his own efforts.","A friend whose hopes we cannot satisfy is a friend we would rather have as an enemy.","With sturdy shoulders, space stands opposing all its weight to nothingness. Where space is, there is being.","Our sense of the tragic waxes and wanes with our sensuality.","Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies?","The philosopher caught in the nets of language.","Through searching out origins, one becomes a crab. The historian looks backwards, and finally he also believes backwards.","Probability but no truth, facility but no freedom--it is owing to these two fruits that the tree of knowledge cannot be confused with the tree of life.","The drive toward knowledge has a moral origin.","This is the fundamental idea of culture, insofar as it sets but one task for each of us: to further the production of the philosopher, of the artist, and of the saint within us and outside us, and thereby to work at the consummation of nature.","When an idea is just rising on the horizon, the soul\'s temperature with respect to it is usually very cold. Only gradually does the idea develop its warmth, and it is hottest (which is to say, exerting its greatest influence) when belief in the idea is already once again in decline.","Spirit is the life that itself cuts into life: with its own torment it increases its own knowledge. Did you already know that?","Even the most honest writer lets slip a word too many when he wants to round off a period.","Writers ought to be regarded as wrongdoers who deserve to be acquitted or pardoned only in the rarest cases: that would be a way to keep books from getting out of hand.","It is doubtful whether anyone who has travelled widely has found anywhere in the world regions more ugly than in the human face.","The quality of a marriage is proven by its ability to tolerate an occasional \\"exception.","It is inhuman to bless where one is cursed.","When we cannot stand certain people, we try to have suspicions about them.","One who dresses in rags that have been washed clean dresses cleanly to be sure, but raggedly nonetheless.","Whoever no longer finds greatness in God no longer finds it anywhere--he must either deny it or create it.","One can also be undignified and flattering toward a virtue.","You highest men whom I have ever seen! This is my suspicion about you and my secret laughter: I guess that you would call my superman--a devil!","Whoever has looked deeply into the world might well guess what wisdom lies in the superficiality of men.","To discover he is loved in return ought really to disenchant the lover with the beloved.","Those who are slow to know suppose that slowness is the essence of knowledge.","Like tourists huffing and puffing to reach the peak we forget the view on the way up.","Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the metaphysical realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is his work. [...] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it.","Great things demand that we either remain silent about them or speak in a great manner: in a great manner, that is-cynically and with innocence.","Verily, a polluted stream is man. One must actually be a sea to take in a polluted stream without becoming impure. Behold, I teach you the superman: he is the this sea, in him can your great contempt go under.","People who, out of an inborn moderation, leave every glass standing only half-emptied refuse to admit that everything in the world has its sediments and dregs.","The beating of drums, which delights young writers who serve a party, sounds to him who does not belong to the party line like a rattling of chains, and excites sympathy rather than admiration.","The really historical performance would talk to ghosts.","The refinement of morality increases together with the refinement of fear. Today the fear of disagreeable feelings in other people is almost the strongest of our own disagreeable feelings.","You who hate the Jews so, why did you adopt their religion?","The great works are produced in such an ecstasy of love that they must always be unworthy of it, however great their worth otherwise.","When, however, you have an enemy, then do not requite him good for evil: for that would shame him. Instead, prove that he did some good for you. And rather be angry than put to shame! And when you are cursed, I do not like it that you want to bless. Rather curse a little also! And if you are done a great injustice, then quickly add five small ones. Hideous to behold is he who is obsessed with an injustice.","Without myth, however, every culture loses its healthy creative natural power: it is only a horizon encompassed with myth that rounds off to unity a social movement.","Moral sensibilities are nowadays at such cross-purposes that to one man a morality is proved by its utility, while to another its utility refutes it.","Yet tell me, my brothers: if a goal for humanity is still lacking, is there not still lacking--humanity itself?","Pity aims just as little at the pleasure of others as malice at the pain of others Per-Se.","The greatest events-they are not our loudest but our stillest hours.","Only you must have worthy foes hate, but not enemies worthy of contempt. You must be proud of your enemy.","I am almost equal to a shadow.","The value of many men and books rests solely on their faculty for compelling all to seek out the most hidden and intimate things.","But anyone who has really made sacrifices knows that he wanted and got something in return perhaps something for something of himself - that he gave up in order to have more here or at least to feel that he has \\"more\\".","Christianity, alcohol the two great means of corruption.","Everything that has been is eternal: the sea will wash it up again.","If we lacked curiosity, we should do less for the good of our neighbor. But, under the name of duty or pity, curiosity steals into the home of the unhappy and the needy. Perhaps even in the famous mother-love there is a good deal of curiosity.","The earth is like the breasts of a woman: useful as well as pleasing.","The surest sign of the estrangement of the opinions of two persons is when they both say something ironical to each other and neither of them feels the irony.","Men use a new lesson or experience later on as a ploughshare or perhaps also as a weapon; women at once make it into an ornament.","One must cease letting oneself be eaten when one tastes best: that is known to those who want to be loved long.","Anyone who has looked deeply into the world may guess how much wisdom lies in the superficiality of men. The instinct that preserves them teaches them to be flighty light, and false.","An educator never says what he himself thinks, but only that which he thinks it is good for those whom he is educating to hear.","Many a one cannot loosen his own fetters, but is nevertheless his friend\'s emancipator.","It is regrettable that a Dostoyevsky did not live near this most interesting of all decadents (Jesus Christ) - I mean someone who would have known how to sense the very stirring charm of such a mixture of the sublime, the sickly, and the childlike.","But in the end one also has to understand that the needs that religion has satisfied and philosophy is now supposed to satisfy are not immutable; they can be weakened and exterminated. Consider, for example, that Christian distress of mind that comes from sighing over ones inner depravity and care for ones salvation - all concepts originating in nothing but errors of reason and deserving, not satisfaction, but obliteration.","No one talks more passionately about his rights than he who in the depths of his soul doubts whether he has any. By enlisting passion on his side he wants to stifle his reason and its doubts: thus he will acquire a good conscience and with it success among his fellow men.","Every word instantly becomes a concept precisely insofar as it is not supposed to serve as a reminder of the unique and entirely individual original experience to which it owes its origin; but rather, a word becomes a concept insofar as it simultaneously has to fit countless more or less similar cases -- which means, purely and simply, cases which are never equal and thus altogether unequal.","Ultimately, no one can extract from things, books included, more than he already knows.","Poets and writers who are in love with the superlative all want to do more than they can.","What a person is begins to betray itself when his talent weakens--when he stops showing what he can do. Talent, too, is ornamentation, and ornamentation, too, is a hiding place.","Where the past is venerated the clean and those who clean things up should be kept out. Piety is never happy without a little dust, dirt, and rubbish.","The most welcome joke to me is the one that takes the place of a heavy, not altogether innocuous thought, at once a cautionary hint of the finger and a flash of the eye.","Fathers have a lot to do to make up for having sons.","Lift up your hearts, my brothers, high, higher! And don\'t forget about your legs either! Lift up your legs as well, you good dancers, and better yet--stand also on your heads!","In a seriously intended intellectual emancipation a person\'s mute passions and cravings also hope to find their advantage.","Not to be cowardly when it comes to our own actions! Not to leave them in the lurch!--The sting of conscience is indecent.","In compassionate men, severity is a virtue.","Men inadvertently comport themselves with nobility when they have grown accustomed to wanting nothing from others and always giving to them.","What is the strongest cure?--Victory.","It is not to everyone\'s taste that truth should be pronounced pleasant. But at least let no one believe that error becomes truth when it is pronounced unpleasant.","I know no other way to associate with great tasks than as play: as a sign of greatness, this is an essential presupposition.","A noble soul is not the one that can manage the highest flights but the one that rises very little and falls very little but always dwells in a free, resplendent atmosphere and altitude.","All idealists imagine that the causes they serve are fundamentally better than any other causes in the world, and they refuse to believe that if their cause is to flourish at all it requires precisely the same foul-smelling manure that is necessary to all other human undertakings.","There are instances when we are like horses, we psychologists, and grow restless: we see our own shadow wavering up and down before us. A psychologist must look away from himself in order to see anything at all.","Man makes god in his own image.","All idealism is falsehood in the face of necessity.","It was a subtle refinement of God to learn Greek when he wished to write a book \u2013 and that he did not learn it better.","You may lie with your mouth, but with the mouth you make as you do so you none the less tell the truth.","Blessed are the sleepy ones: for they shall soon drop off.","I have forgotten my umbrella.","This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time; the light on the stars requires time; deeds though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than the most distant stars - and yet they have done it themselves.","Pardon me, my friends, I have ventured to paint my happiness on the wall.","Sensuality often hastens the \\"Growth of Love\\" so much that the roots remain weak and are easily torn up.","The danger in happiness - \\"Now everything is turning out right for me; from now on i\'ll love every turn of fate - Who wants to be my fate?","It was the sick and decaying who despised the body and earth and invented the heavenly realm and the redemptive drops of blood: but they took even these sweet and gloomy poisons from body and earth. They wanted to escape their own misery, and the stars were too far for them.","Happiness: being able to forget or, to express in a more learned fashion.","The bite of conscience is indecent.","A little wisdom is indeed possible; but this blessed security have I found in all things, that they prefer--to DANCE on the feet of chance.","Ye shall only have foes to be hated; but not foes to be despised: ye must be proud of your foes.","Your educators can only be your liberators.","Our crime against criminals lies in the fact that we treat them like rascals.","Most people are far too much occupied with themselves to be malicious.","There is no better soporific and sedative than skepticism.","He who has attained intellectual emancipation to any extent cannot, for a long time, regard himself otherwise than as a wanderer on the face of the earth and not even as a traveller towards a final goal, for there is no such thing.","A man unconsciously imagines that where he is strong, where he feels most thoroughly alive, the element of his freedom must lie.","Compulsion precedes morality, indeed morality itself is compulsion for a time, to which one submits for the avoidance of pain.","The destiny of mankind is arranged for happy moments every life has such but not for happy times.","To think historically is almost the same thing now as if in all ages history had been made according to theory.","For the purpose of knowledge we must know how to make use of the inward current which draws us towards a thing, and also of the current which after a time draws us away from it.","Spiritual strength and passion, when accompanied by bad manners, only provoke loathing.","Our vanity desires that what we do best should be considered what is hardest for us.","Courage is the best slayer - courage which attacketh, for in every attack there is the sound of triumph.","Curiosity creeps into the houses of the unfortunate and the needy under the name of duty or of pity.","It is a prejudice to think that morality is more favourable to the development of reason than immorality.","For all things are baptized at the font of eternity, and beyond good and evil; good and evil themselves, however, are but intervening shadows and damp afflictions and passing clouds.","... hitherto we have been permitted to seek beauty only in the morally good - a fact which sufficiently accounts for our having found so little of it and having had to seek about for imaginary beauties without backbone! - As surely as the wicked enjoy a hundred kinds of happiness of which the virtuous have no inkling, so too they possess a hundred kinds of beauty; and many of them have not yet been discovered.","What the father kept silent the son speaks out.","To escape boredom, man works either beyond what his usual needs require, or else he invents play, that is, work that is designed to quiet no need other than that for working in general.","Everything about woman is a riddle, and everything about woman has a single solution: that is, pregnancy","It is the music in our conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral sermons, and goody goodness won\u2019t chime.","Against the censurers of brevity. - Something said briefly can be the fruit of much long thought: but the reader who is a novice in this field, and has as yet reflected on it not at all, sees in everything said briefly something embryonic, not without censuring the author for having served him up such immature and unripened fare.","Gradually it has become clear to me what every great philosophy so far has been: namely, the personal confession of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir.","Even today a crude sort of persecution is all that is required to create an honorable name for any sect, no matter how indifferent in itself.","Socrates.- If all goes well, the time will come when one will take up the memorabilia of Socrates rather than the Bible as a guide to morals and reason... The pathways of the most various philosophical modes of life lead back to him... Socrates excels the founder of Christianity in being able to be serious cheerfully and in possessing that wisdom full of roguishness that constitutes the finest state of the human soul. And he also possessed the finer intellect.","The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a wheel rolling on its own, a prime movement, a sacred Yes.","As much as possible, and this as quickly as possible: that is what the great mental and emotional illness craves that is variously called \\"present\\" or \\"culture,\\" but that is actually a symptom of consumption.","Christianity is Platonism for the people.","Yet where is your inner value when you no longer know what it is to breathe freely; when you no longer have freedom over your own selves","The rising and falling of the scales of pride and humility sustain the brooding mind as well as the alternations of desire and peace of the soul.","One should not understand this compulsion to construct concepts, species, forms, purposes, laws (\'a world of identical cases\') as if they enabled us to fix the real world; but as a compulsion to arrange a world for ourselves in which our existence is made possible:-we thereby create a world which is calculable, simplified, comprehensible, etc., for us.","Man does not strive for happiness; only the Englishman does that.","Without the perpetual counterfeiting of the universe by number, man could not continue to live","One must first be firmly set in oneself, one must stand securely on one\'s own two legs otherwise one cannot love at all.","In order for once to get a glimpse of our European morality from a distance, in order to compare it with other earlier or future moralities, one must do as the traveller who wants to know the height of the towers of a city: he leaves the city.","In the beautiful, man sets himself up as the standard of perfection; in select cases he worships himself in it. Man believes that the world itself is filled with beauty -he forgets that it is he who has created it. He alone has bestowed beauty upon the world -alas! only a very human, an all too human, beauty.","Early in the morning, at break of day, in all the freshness and dawn of one\'s strength, to read a book -I call that vicious!","The genius-in work and in deed-is necessarily a squanderer: the fact that he spends himself constitutes his greatness.","If we have our own why of life, we shall get along with almost any how. Man does not strive for pleasure; only the Englishman does.","It is only great pain--that slow, sustained pain that takes its time, in which we are, as it were, burned with smoldering green firewood--that forces us philosophers to sink to our ultimate profundity and to do away with all the trust, everything good-natured, veil-imposing, mild and middling, on which we may have previously based our humanity. I doubt that such a pain makes us \'better\'--but I know that it makes us deeper.","Whatever a theologian regards as true must be false: there you have almost a criterion of truth.","The domestication (the culture) of man does not go deep--where it does go deep it at once becomes degeneration (type: the Christian). The \'savage\' (or, in moral terms, the evil man) is a return to nature--and in a certain sense his recovery, his cure from \'culture\'.","A joke is an epigram on the death of a feeling.","What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its end in itself. But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are the end of all things: so vain are they.","Whatever is gold does not glitter. A gentle radiance belongs to the noblest metal.","All truths are bloody truths to me.","I fear animals regard man as a creature of their own kind which has in a highly dangerous fashion lost its healthy animal reason - as the mad animal, as the laughing animal, as the weeping animal, as the unhappy animal.","Of all writings I love only that which is written with blood. Write with blood: and you will discover that blood is spirit.","There is nothing for which men ask to be paid dearer than for humiliation.","Nothing seems to me to be rarer today then genuine hypocrisy. I greatly suspect that this plant finds the mild atmosphere of our culture unendurable. Hypocrisy has its place in the ages of strong belief: in which even when one is compelled to exhibit a different belief one does not abandon the belief one already has.","Beauty is for the artist something outside all orders of rank, because in beauty opposites are tamed; the highest sign of power, namely power over opposites; moreover, without tension: - that violence is no longer needed: that everything follows, obeys, so easily and so pleasantly - that is what delights the artist\'s WILL TO POWER.","There did he sit shrivelled in his chimney corner, fretting on account of his weak legs, world weary, will weary, and one day he suffocated through his excessive pity.","It seems to me that to take a book of mine into his hands is one of the rarest distinctions that anyone can confer upon himself. I even assume that he removes his shoes when he does so-not to speak of boots.","The weak and the botched shall perish: first principle of our charity.","If we make sacrifices in doing good or in doing ill, it does not alter the ultimate value of our actions; even if we stake our life in the cause, as martyrs do for the sake of our church : it is a sacrifice to our longing for power, or for the purpose of conserving our sense of power.","Have you heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the market place, and cried incessantly, I seek God! I seek God! As many of those who do not believe in God were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter...\\nWhither is God, he cried. I shall tell you. We have killed him - you and I. All of us are murderers.... God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.","Having a talent is not enough: one must also have your permission to have it--right, my friends?","When the gratitude that many owe to one discards all modesty, then there is fame.","Some men have sighed over the abduction of their wives, but many more have sighed because no one wanted to abduct theirs.","Not with wrath do we kill, but with laughter. Come, let us kill the spirit of gravity!","Horrible experiences lead us to wonder whether the person who experiences them might not be something horrible.","The really royal calling of the philosopher (as expressed by Alcuin the Anglo-Saxon): To correct what is wrong, and strengthen the right, and raise what is holy.","I am not a man, I am dynamite!","The noble caste was in the beginning always the barbarian caste: their superiority lay, not in their physical strength, but primarily in their psychical - they were more complete human beings.","He who knows not how to plant his will in things at least endows them with some meaning: that is to say, he believes that a will is already present in them (A principle of faith.)","The Christian church is an encyclopedia of prehistoric cults.","We are praised or blamed, as the one or the other may be expedient, for displaying to advantage our power of discernment.","Everywhere resoundeth the voices of those who preach death; and the earth is full of those to whom death hath to be preached.","Here the spirit becomes a lion who would conquer his freedom and be master\u2026 Who is the great dragon whom the spirit will no longer call lord and go? \u2018Thou shalt\u2019 is the name of the great dragon. But the spirit of the lion says, \u2018I will.","You know these things as thoughts, but your thoughts are not your experiences, they are an echo and after-effect of your experiences: as when your room trembles whe na carriage goes past. I however am sitting in the carriage, and often I am the carriage itself. Ina man who thinks like this, the dichotomy between thinking and feeling, intellect and passion, has really disappeared. He feels his thoughts. He can fall in love with an idea. An idea can make him ill.","And let that day be lost to us on which we did not dance once! And let that wisdom be false to us that brought no laughter with it!","The Gay Science, section 108","When the gratitude of many to one throws away all shame, we behold fame.","I love him who justifieth the future ones, and redeemeth the past ones: for he is willing to succumb through the present ones.","\\"Ego,\\" sayest thou, and art proud of that word. But the greater thing - in which thou art unwilling to believe - is thy body with its big sagacity; it saith not \\"ego,\\" but doeth it.","Life is hard to bear: but do not affect to be so delicate! We are all of us fine sumpter asses and assesses.","Love and hatred are not blind, but are blinded by the fire they bear within themselves.","Where do your greatest dangers lie?--In pity.","Socrates condemned art because he preferred philosophy and only after much internal struggle did Plato accept this judgment.","In those days it was possible for a Greek to flee from an over-abundant reality as though it were but the tricky scheming off the imagination-and to flee, not like Plato into the land of eternal ideas, into the workshop off the world-creator, feasting one\'s eyes on the unblemished unbreakable archetypes, but into the rigor mortis off the coldest emptiest concept off all, the concept of being.","That the world is a divine game and beyond good and evil:Min this the Vedanta philosophy and Heraclitus are my predecessors.","The happiness of man is: I will. The happiness of woman is: he wills. \'Behold , just now the world ... entire love. And woman must obey and find a depth for her surface. Surface is the disposition of woman: a mobile, stormy film over shallow water. Man\'s disposition, however, is deep; his river roars in subterranean caves: woman feels his strength but does not comprehend it.","Life without music is only error, exhaustion, exile... Indeed, there is nothing that concerns me more than the fate of music.","There is nothing we like to communicate to others as much as the seal of secrecy together with what lies under it.","Whoever aims publicly at great things and at length perceives secretly that he is too weak to achieve them, has usually also insufficient strength to renounce his aims publicly, and then inevitably becomes a hypocrite.","Mathematics would certainly have not come into existence if one had known from the beginning that there was in nature no exactly straight line, no actual circle, no absolute magnitude.","The concepts \\"beyond\\" and \\"real world\\" were invented in order to depreciate the only world that exists-in order that no goal, no aim or task might be left for our earthly reality.","Sometimes we owe a friend to the lucky circumstance that we give him no cause for envy.","Idleness is the parent of psychology.","I do not know what the spirit of a philosopher could more wish to be than a good dancer.

The influence of climate upon the bodily functionsextends so far, that a blunder in the choice of locality and climate is able not only to alienate a man from his actual duty, but also to withhold it from him altogether, so that he never even comes face to face with it.","Out of a brotherly love we occasionally embrace this or that somebody (because we cannot embrace everybody): but we must never letour somebody know it.","Industriousness and conscientiousness are often at odds, because industriousness wants to pick the still sour fruit from the tree,while conscientiousness lets it hang there too long, until it falls and bruises.","Although you have so far demonstrated little faith in my ability to pay, I yet hope to demonstrate that I am somebody who pays his debts-for example, to you.","Some people throw a bit of their personality after their bad arguments, as if that might straighten their paths and turn them into right and good arguments-just as a man in a bowling alley, after he has let go of the ball, still tries to direct it with gestures.","Those people have no real interest in a science who only begin to get excited about it when they themselves have made discoveries in it.","Whether we immoralists do any harm to virtue?-Just as little as anarchists do to princes. It is only because they have been shot at that they once again sit securely on their thrones. Moral: we must shoot at morals.","With regard to philosophical metaphysics, I always see increasing numbers who have attained to the negative goal, but as yet few who climb a few rungs backwards; one ought to look out, perhaps, over the last steps of the ladder, but not try to stand upon them.","The charm of the Platonic mode of thought ... consisted precisely in the resistance to the obvious evidence of the senses.","As a human being Plato mingles regal, exclusive, and self-contained features with melancholy compassion.","[Heraclitus had] the highest form of pride [stemming] from a certainty of belief in the truth as grasped by himself alone. He brings this form, by its excessive development, into a sublime pathos by involuntary identification of himself with his truth.","[Heraclitus speaks as if] in entrancement ... but [also] truthfully.","[Heraclitus had] pride not in logical knowledge but rather in intuitive grasping of the truth.","[Heraclitus] did not require humans or their sort of knowledge, since everything into which one may inquire he despises [as being] in contrast [to his own] inward-turning wisdom.

The great majority of men have no right to existence, but are a misfortune to higher men.","It is the good war that hallows every cause.","The flame is not as bright to itself as it is to those it illuminates: so too the sage.","Women are constituted in such a way that all truth (regarding men, love, children, society, the purpose of life) disgusts them, and in such a way that they try to revenge themselves on anyone who opens their eyes.","Few serve truth in truth because only few have the pure will to be just, and of those again very few have the strength to be just.","Whoever writes in blood and aphorisms wants not to be learned but to be learned by heart.","Evaluation is creation: hear it, you creators! Evaluating is itself the most valuable treasure of all that we value. It is only through evaluation that value exists: and without evaluation the nut of existence would be hollow.

We should also respect the enemy in our friend.","Women are considered deep - why? Because one can never discover any bottom to them. Women are not even shallow.","There are slavish souls who carry their appreciation for favors done them so far that they strangle themselves with the rope of gratitude.","If a woman possesses manly virtues, she is to be run away from; and if she does not possess them, she runs away herself.","When art dresses itself in the most worn-out material it is most easily recognized as art.","Before the effect one believes in different causes than one does after the effect.","Genteel women suppose that those things do not really exist about which it is impossible to talk in polite company.","To use the same words is not a sufficient guarantee of understanding; one must use the same words for the same genus of inward experience; ultimately one must have one\'s experiences in common.","I fear that, with our current veneration for the natural and the real, we have arrived at the opposite pole to all idealism, and have landed in the region of the waxworks.","What we experience in dreams - assuming that we experience it often - belongs in the end just as much to the over-all economy of our soul as anything experienced \\"actually\\": we are richer or poorer on account of it.","But every soil becomes finally exhausted, and the ploughshare of evil must always come once more.","It is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is not to be lost.

When I ascend I often jump over steps, and no step forgives me that.","However modest one may be in one\'s demand for intellectual cleanliness, one cannot help feeling, when coming into contact with the New Testament, a kind of inexpressible discomfiture: for the unchecked impudence with which the least qualified want to raise their voice on the greatest problems, and even claim to be judges of such things, surpasses all measure. The shameless levity with which the most intractable problems (life, world, God, purpose of life) are spoken of, as if they were not problems at all but simply things that these little bigots knew!","In his heart every man knows quite well that, being unique, he will be in the world only once and that no imaginable chance will for a second time gather together into a unity so strangely variegated an assortment as he is: he knows it but hides it like a bad conscience.","We set no special value on the possession of a virtue until we percieve that it is entirely lacking in our adversary.","Disobedience- that is the nobility of slaves.","Righteousness exalteth a nation.","A man as he ought to be: that sounds to us as insipid as \\"a tree as it ought to be.","Is Wagner a human being at all?

He contaminates everything he touches - he has made music sick.","We often contradict an opinion for no other reason than that we do not like the tone in which it is expressed.","Those with very loud voices in their throats are nearly incapable of thinking subtle thoughts.","Seducing one\'s neighbor to a good opinion and then afterwards believing devoutly in this neighbor\'s opinion--who can match women in this clever ploy?","What saved me then? Nothing but pregnancy. And each time after I had given birth to my work my life hung suspended by a thin thread.","Pain makes hens and poets cackle.","Whoever has character also has his typical experience, which returns over and over again.","There is an innocence in lying which is the sign of good faith in a cause.","But eternal liveliness is what counts: what does \\"eternal life\\" matter, or life at all?","When horror is associated with what is harmful, evil results, when disgust does, badness.","Animals know nothing of themselves, and they also know nothing of the world.","With deep men, as with deep wells, it takes a long time for anything that falls into them to hit bottom. Onlookers, who almost never wait long enough, readily suppose that such men are callous and unresponsive--or even boring.","Unresolved dissonances between the characters and dispositions of the parents continue to reverberate in the nature of the child and make up the history of its inner sufferings.","And if a man goes through fire for his doctrine - what does that prove? Verily, it is more if your own doctrine comes out of your own fire.","I speak and the child plays: who can be more serious than we are?","One does well to put on gloves when reading the New Testament.

I am not afraid of anything because the lord is my shepherd!","There is more wisdom in your body than in your best wisdom. And who then knows why your body needs precisely your best wisdom?","One who has a why can endure anyhow.","A man should not play the coward to his deeds.

Pangs of conscience are indecent.","How good music and bad reasons sound when one marches against an enemy.","To be the equal of one\'s opponent-this is the first condition of an honourable duel.","The significance of language for the evolution of culture lies in this, that mankind set up in language a separate world beside the other world, a place it took to be so firmly set that, standing upon it, it could lift the rest of the world off its hinges and make itself master of it. To the extent that man has for long ages believed in the concepts and names of things as in aeternae veritates he has appropriated to himself that pride by which he raised himself above the animal: he really thought that in language he possessed knowledge of the world.","It is terrible to die of thirst in the ocean. Do you have to salt your truth so heavily that it does not even-quench thirst any more?","One pays dearly for being immortal: one must die many times during his life.","Thinking about suicide is a potent consolation: it helps us to get through many a bad night.","Has there ever been anything filthier on earth than the saints in the wilderness? Around them was not only the devil loose around them- but also the swine.","That, however, is - mediocrity, though it be called moderation.","As a result, nature is something entirely different from what comes to mind when we invoke its name.","That roguish and cheerful vice, politeness.","A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly consolidated mediocrity.","Little prigs and three-quarter madmen may have the conceit that the laws of nature are constantly broken for their sakes.","I do not give alms; I am not poor enough for that.","The god on the cross is a curse on life, a signpost to seek redemption from life; Dionysus cut to pieces is a promise of life: it will be eternally reborn and return again from destruction","Christianity gave Eros poison to drink; he did not die of it, certainly, but degenerated to Vice.","Completely true to nature!\' - what a lie: / How could nature ever be constrained into a picture? / The smallest bit of nature is infinite! / And so he paints what he likes about it. / And what does he like? He likes what he can paint!","Freedom of Will-that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order-who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful underwills or under-souls-indeed, our body is but a social structure composed of many souls-to his feelings of delight as commander.","Great indebtedness does not make men grateful, but vengeful; and if a little charity is not forgotten, it turns into a gnawing worm.","This is what is hardest: to close the open hand because one loves.","What?

But \'God can exist even less without unwise men\' - that good old Luther did not say.","However un-Christian this may sound, I am not even predisposed against myself.","Christianity has the rancor of the sick at its very core-the instinct against the healthy, against health.

As though we would want at any time in our life to live without play and fairytales! We give these things other names, to be sure, and feel differently about them, but precisely this is the evidence that they are the same things, for the child too regards play as his work and fairy tales as his truth. The brevity of life ought to preserve us from a pedantic division of life into different stages - as though each brought something new.","If you look long enough into the void, the void begins to look back through you.","Because men really respect only that which was founded of old and has developed slowly, he who wants to live on after his death must take care not only of his posterity but even more of his past.","Again and again I am brought up against it, and again and again I resist it: I don\'t want to believe it, even though it is almost palpable: the vast majority lack an intellectual conscience; indeed, it often seems to me that to demand such a thing is to be in the most populous cities as solitary as in the desert.","For both parties in a controversy, the most disagreeable way of retaliating is to be vexed and silent; for the aggressor usually regards the silence as a sign of contempt.","Moral contempt is a far greater indignity and insult than any kind of crime.","Speaking is a beautiful folly; with that man dances over all things.","What is new, however, is always evil, being that which wants to conquer and overthrow the old boundary markers and the old pieties; and only what is old is good. The good men are in all ages those who dig the old thoughts, digging deep and getting them to bear fruit - the farmers of the spirit. But eventually all land is depleted, and the ploughshare of evil must come again and again.","A little poison now and then: that makes for pleasant dreams. And a lot of poison at the end, for a pleasant death.","In the mountains, the shortest way is from peak to peak: but for that you must have long legs","The anarchist and the Christian have a common origin.","Away from God and gods did this will lure me: what would there be to create if gods existed?","The concepts \\"soul\\", \\"spirit\\" and last of all the concept \\"immortal soul\\" were invented in order to despise the body, in order to make it sick - \\"holy\\" - in order to cultivate an attitude of appalling disrespect for all things in life which deserve to be treated seriously i.","\\"God\\", \\"the immortality of the soul\\", \\"salvation\\", \\"the beyond\\"-even as a child I had no time for such notions, I do not waste any time upon them-maybe I was never childish enough for that?","God is a too palpably clumsy answer; an answer which shows a lack of delicacy towards us thinkers-fundamentally, even a crude prohibition to us: you shall not think!","In short, then, the religious cult is based upon the representations of sorcery between man and man, and the sorcerer is older than the priest.","The \\"religion of pity\\" to which people would like to convert us- oh, we know well enough the hysterical little men and women who need this religion at present as a veil and an adornment!","Art raises its head where creeds relax.","There is a lake that one day refused to flow away and threw up a dam at the place where it had before flowed out and since then this lake has always risen higher and higher. Perhaps the very act of renunciation provides us with the strength to bear it ; perhaps man will rise ever higher and higher when he no longer flows out into a God.","If God had wanted to become an object of love, he would first of all have had to forgo judging and justice : a judge, and even a gracious judge, is no object of love.","Prejudice of the learned. - The learned judge correctly that people of all ages have believed they know what is good and evil, praise- and blameworthy. But it is a prejudice of the learned that we now know better than any other age.","For let us not underestimate the Christian: the Christian, false to the point of innocence, is far above the ape-regarding Christians, a well known theory of descent becomes a mere compliment.","Over immense periods of time the intellect produced nothing but errors. A few of these proved to be useful and helped to preserve the species: those who hit upon or inherited these had better luck in their struggle for themselves and their progeny. Such erroneous articles of faith... include the following: that there are things, substances, bodies; that a thing is what it appears to be; that our will is free; that what is good for me is also good in itself.","Anti-theses.- The most senile thing ever thought about man is contained in the celebrated saying \'the ego is always hateful\'; the most childish is the even more celebrated \'love thy neighbor as thyself\'. - In the former, knowledge of human nature has ceased, in the latter it has not yet even begun.","Assuming that he believes at all, the everyday Christian is a pitiful figure, a man who really cannot count up to three, and who besides, precisely because of his mental incompetence, would not deserve such a punishment as Christianity promises him.","The advent of the Christian God, as the maximum god attained so far, was therefore accompanied by the maximum feeling of guilty indebtedness on earth.","There are more idols than realities in the world: that is my \\"evil eye\\" for this world, which is also my \\"evil ear\\".","One does not kill by anger but by laughter.","We cannot even reproduce our thoughts entirely in words.","We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we can live - by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content; without these articles of faith nobody could now endure life. But that does not prove them. Life is no argument. The conditions of life might include error.","Faced with a world of \\"modern ideas\\" which would like to banish everyone into a corner and a \\"specialty,\\" a philosopher, if there could be a philosopher these days, would be compelled to establish the greatness of mankind, the idea of \\"greatness,\\" on the basis of his own particular extensive range and multiplicity, his own totality in the midst of diversity.","Marriages that made out of love (so-called \\"love-matches\\") have error as their father and misery (necessity) as their mother.","For the longest time, marriage has had a guilty conscience about itself. Should we believe it?--Yes, we should believe it.","To get into just those situations where sham virtues will not suffice, but rather where, as with the ropedancer on his rope, one either falls or stands--or gets down.","In being wildly natural we recover best from being unnatural, from being spiritual.","This crown to crown the laughing man, this rose-wreath crown: I myself have set this crown upon my head, I myself have pronounced my laughter holy.","Here we also see: what this divinity lacks is not only a sense of shame-and there are also other reasons for conjecturing that in several respects all of the gods could learn from us humans. We humans are-more humane.","After Buddha was dead, his shadow was still shown for centuries in a cave.","You shall become the person you are.","One must have all the virtues to sleep well. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery? Shall I covet my neighbor\'s maid? All that would go ill with good sleep.","I want to speak to the despisers of the body. I would not have them learn and teach differently, but merely say farewell to their own bodies-- and thus become silent.","Time flies apace-we would fain believe that everything flies forward with it.","The vanity of others runs counter to our taste only when it runs counter to our vanity.","Life is a well of joy; but for those out of whom an upset stomach speaks, which is the father of melancholy, all wells are poisoned.","I fly in dreams, I know it is my privilege, I do not recall a single situation in dreams when I was unable to fly. To execute every sort of curve and angle with a light impulse, a flying mathematics - that is so distinct a happiness that it has permanently suffused my basic sense of happiness.","When one gives up Christian belief one thereby deprives oneself of the right to Christian morality. For the latter is absolutely not self-evident: one must make this point clear again and again, in spite of English shallowpates.","Our vanity would have just that which we do best count as that which is hardest for us. The origin of many a morality.","Unpleasant, even dangerous, qualities can be found in every nation and every individual: it is cruel to demand that the Jew be an exception. In him, these qualities may even be dangerous and revolting to an unusual degree; and perhaps the young stock-exchange Jew is altogether the most disgusting invention of mankind.","Faith means the will to avoid knowing what is true.","We can speak very much to the purpose and yet in such a way that the whole world cries out in contradiction: namely, when we are not speaking to the whole world.","Where I found the living, there I found the will to power; even in the will of servants I found the will to be master.","Among austere men intimacy involves shame--and is something precious.","It is with artworks as it is with wine: it is much better when we do not need either one, when we stick with water, and when out of our own inner fire, the inner sweetness of our own soul, we turn the water over and over again into wine ourselves.","The machine is impersonal, it takes the pride away from a piece of work, the individual merits and defects that go along with allwork that is not done by a machine--which is to say, its little bit of humanity.","The woman and the genius do not work. Up to now, woman has been mankind\'s supreme luxury. In all those moments when we do our best, we do not work. Work is merely a means to these moments.","What really makes one indignant about suffering isn\'t the thing itself but the senselessness of it.","About what we neither know nor feel precisely while awake-whether we have a good or a bad conscience toward a certain person-our dreams instruct us fully and unambiguously.","Each word of Heraclitus expresses the pride and the majesty of truth, but of truth grasped in intuitions rather than attained by the rope ladder of logic.","Does wisdom perhaps appear on the earth as a raven which is inspired by the smell of carrion?","The wittiest authors evoke a barely perceptible smile.","The grand style follows suit with all great passion. It disdains to please, it forgets to persuade. It commands. It wills.","When I contemplated purpose I also contemplated chance and foolishness.","The most dangerous physicians are those born actors who imitate born physicians with a perfectly deceptive guile.","When one thinks profusely and cleverly, not only his face but his body too takes on a clever appearance.","The saying, \\"The Magyar is much too lazy to be bored,\\" is worth thinking about. Only the most subtle and active animals are capable of boredom.--A theme for a great poet would be God\'s boredom on the seventh day of creation.","What an age experiences as evil is usually an untimely reverberation echoing what was previously experienced as good--the atavismof an older ideal.","Their usual mistaken premise is that they affirm some consensus among people, at least among tame peoples, concerning certain moral principles, and then conclude that these principles must be unconditionally binding also for you and me-or conversely, they see that among different peoples moral valuations are necessarily different and infer from this that no morality is binding-both of which are equally childish.","There are expressions and bulls-eyes of the spirit, there are epigrams, a little handful of words, in which a whole culture, a whole society is suddenly crystallized.","I will believe in the Redeemer when the Christians look a little more redeemed.","This world is the will to power and nothing besides!","Heraclitus was an opponent of all democratic parties.","Every man who has declared that some other man is an ass or a scoundrel, gets angry when the other man conclusively shows that the assertion was erroneous.","Nothing in life possesses value except the degree of power--assuming that life itself is the will to power.","Conversation with a friend will only bear good fruit of knowledge when both think only of the matter under consideration and forget that they are friends.","Those who are bent on revolutionizing society may be divided into those who seek something for themselves thereby and those who seek something for their children and grandchildren.","The perfect woman is a higher type of humanity than the perfect man, and also something much rarer. The natural history of animals furnishes grounds in support of this theory.","The most vulnerable and yet most unconquerable of things is human vanity; nay, through being wounded its strength increases and can grow to giant proportions.","Against boredom the gods themselves fight in vain.","With the strength of his spiritual sight and insight the distance, and as it were the space, around man continually expands: his world grows deeper, ever new stars, ever new images and enigmas come into view.","The masters have been done away with; the morality of the common man has triumphed.","I do not mean to moralise but to those who do, I would give this advice : if you mean ultimately to deprive the best things and states of all all honour and worth then continue to talk about them as you have been doing!","Robinson had a servant even better than Friday: His name was Crusoe.","We have to be careful that in throwing out the devil, we don\'t throw out the best part of ourselves.","Speaking of Georges Bizet: His music has the tang of sunny climates, their bracing air, their clearness. It voices a sensibility hitherto unknown to us.","Society tames the wolf into a dog. And man is the most domesticated animal of all.","When a man is ill his very goodness is sickly.","Another Christian concept, no less crazy, has passed even more deeply into the tissue of modernity: the concept of the \'equality of souls before God.\' This concept furnishes the prototype of all theories of equal rights.","No more fiction, for now we calculate; but that we may calculate, we had to make fiction first.","I am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because I can no longer believe in you.","By means of music the very passions, enjoy themselves.","That which an age considers evil is usually an unseasonable echo of what was formerly considered good - the atavism of an old ideal.","One should part from life as Odysseus parted from Nausicaa-blessing it rather than in love with it.","Weariness is the shortest path to equality and fraternity-and finally liberty is bestowed by sleep.","To demand of strength that it should not express itself as strength, that it should not be a desire to overcome, a desire to throw down, a desire to become master, a thirst for enemies and resistances and triumphs, is just as absurd as to demand of weakness that it should express itself as strength.","The drive toward the formation of metaphors is the fundamental human drive, which one cannot for a single instant dispense with in thought , for one would thereby dispense with man himself.","Philosophers are not honest enough in their work, although they make a lot of virtuous noise when the problem of truthfulness is touched even remotely. They all pose as if they had discovered and reached their real opinions through the self-development of a cold, pure, divinely unconcerned dialectic...; while at bottom it is an assumption, a hunch, indeed a kind of \\"inspiration\\" most often a desire of the heart that has been filtered and made abstract that they defend with reasons they have sought after the fact.","I do not know what meaning classical studies could have for our time if they were not untimely that is to say, acting counter to our time and thereby acting on our time and, let us hope, for the benefit of a time to come.","But by my love and hope I beseech you: do not throw away the hero in your soul! Hold holy your highest hope!","In the \'in-itself\' there is nothing of \'causal connections\', of \'necessity\', or of \'psychological non-freedom\'; there the effect does not follow the cause, there is no rule or \'law\'. It is we alone who have devised cause, sequence, for-each-other, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we project and mix this symbol world into things as if it existed \'in itself\', we act once more as we have always acted- mythologically.","The various languages placed side by side show that with words it is never a question of truth, never a question of adequate expression; otherwise, there would not be so many languages. The \'thing in itself\' (which is precisely what the pure truth, apart from any of its consequences, would be) is likewise something quite incomprehensible to the creator of language and something not in the least worth striving for.","Great men\'s errors are to be venerated as more fruitful than little men\'s truths.","In a friend one should have ones best enemy. You should be closest to him with your heart when you resist him.","One should adpot only those situations in which one is in no need of sham virtues, but rather, like the tight-rope dancer on his tight rope, in which one must either fall or stand--or escape.","Such men alone are my readers, my proper readers, my preordained readers. Of what account are the rest? The rest are simply... humanity. One must be superior to humanity in power, in loftiness of soul- in contempt.","Joy wants the eternity of all things, wants deep, wants deep eternity.","We should conserve evil just as we should conserve the forests. It is true that by thinning and clearing the forests the earth grew warmer.","Willing sets you free: that is the true doctrine of will and freedom--thus Zarathustra instructs you.","Men seldom persevere in a vocation unless they believe or can convince themselves that it is fundamentally more important than anyother calling. Women are the same with their lovers.","What does it matter whether I am shown to be right! I am right too much!--And he who laughs best today will also laugh last.","That is the most extreme form of nihilism: nothingness (the \\"meaningless\\") eternally!","The enjoyment that all morality has given us to now and that it continues to give us--and so, what has kept it going up to now--lies in everyone\'s right, without lengthy investigation, to praise and blame. And who could endure life without praising and blaming!","Since Copernicus, man seems to have got himself on an inclined plane-now he is slipping faster and faster away from the center into-what? into nothingness? into a \'penetrating sense of his nothingness?\' ... all science, natural as well as unnatural-which is what I call the self-critique of knowledge-has at present the object of dissuading man from his former respect for himself, as if this had been but a piece of bizarre conceit.","There are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves the beast of prey, and have no choice except lusts or self-laceration. And even their lusts are self-laceration.","Judgments, value judgments concerning life, for or against, can in the last resort never be true: they possess value only as symptoms, they come into consideration only as symptoms - in themselves such judgments are stupidities.","From the sun did I learn this, when it goeth down, the exuberant one: gold doth it then pour into the sea, out of inexhaustible riches, -So that the poorest fisherman roweth even with golden oars! For this did I once see, and did not tire of weeping in beholding it. - Like the sun will also Zarathustra go down: now sitteth he here and waiteth, old broken tables around him, and also new tables half-written.","Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman \u2014 a rope over an abyss.","You say, it\'s dark. And in truth, I did place a cloud before your sun. But do you not see how the edges of the cloud are already glowing and turning light.","The architect represents neither a Dionysian nor an Apollinian condition: here it is the mighty act of will, the will which moves mountains, the intoxication of the strong will, which demands artistic expression. The most powerful men have always inspired the architects; the architect has always been influenced by power.","Oh great star! What would your happiness be if you did not have us to shine for?","And as long as you are in any way ashamed before yourself, you do not yet belong with us.","I should not believe in a God who does not dance.","What is wanted - whether this is admitted or not - is nothing less than a fundamental remolding, indeed weakening and abolition of the individual: one never tires of enumerating and indicating all that is evil and inimical, prodigal, costly, extravagant in the form individual existence has assumed hitherto, one hopes to manage more cheaply, more safely, more equitably, more uniformly if there exist only large bodies and their members.","I would believe only in a God that knows how to Dance.","What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions \u2014 they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force.","Every day I count wasted in which there has been no dancing.","I am one thing, my writings are another.","He who strays from the customary becomes a sacrifice to the extraordinary; he who keeps to the customary becomes its slave. He iscondemned to perish in either case.","The world is a work of art that gives birth to itself.","No one can draw more out of things, books included, than he already knows. A man has no ears for that to which experience has given him no access.","It is not conflict of opinions that has made history so violent but conflict of belief in opinions, that is to say conflict of convictions.","Socrates ... is the first philosopher of life [Lebensphilosoph], ... Thinking serves life, while among all previous philosophers life had served thought and knowledge. ... Thus Socratic philosophy is absolutely practical: it is hostile to all knowledge unconnected to ethical implications.","Triumph depends on a roll of Fate\'s dice; the ultimate prize is a place in Heaven.","A good aphorism is too hard for the tooth of time, and is not worn away by all the centuries, although it serves as food for every epoch. Hence it is the greatest paradox in literature, the imperishable in the midst of change, the nourishment which always remains highly valued, as salt does, and never becomes stupid like salt.","[Heraclitus had] a regal air of certainty.","Possessions are usually diminished by possession.","He who does not need to lie is proud of not being a liar.","Someone said: \\"I have been prejudiced against myself from my earliest childhood: hence I find some truth in all blame and some stupidity in all praise. I generally estimate praise too poorly and blame too highly.","The noble type of man feels himself to be the determiner of values, he does not need to be approved of, he judges \'what harms me is harmful in itself\', he knows himself to be that which in general accords honour to things, he creates values.","Let your love to life be love to your highest hope; and let your highest hope be the highest thought of life!","He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another century of readers - and spirit itself will stink.","The danger of our culture.- We belong to a period of which the culture is in danger of being destroyed by the appliances of culture.","Three metamorphoses of the spirit I relate to you: how the spirit becomes a camel; and the camel, a lion; and the lion, finally, a child.","Some are made modest by great praise, others insolent.","It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the \\"free will\\" owes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to refute it.","My philosophy is inverted Platonism: the further a thing is from true being, the purer, the lovelier, the better it is. Living inillusion as a goal!","People buy their necessities in shops and have to pay dearly for them because they have to assist in paying for what is also on sale there but only rarely finds purchasers: the luxury and amusement goods. So it is that luxury continually imposes a tax on the simple people who have to do without it.","How difficult it is to live when one feels that the judgment of many millenniums is around one and against one.","I welcome all the signs indicating that a more manly and warlike age is commencing, which will, above all, bring heroism again into honour!","Thou seekest disciples? Then thou seekest ciphers.","The shortest route is not the most direct one, but rather the one where the most favorable winds swell our sails:Mthat is the lesson that seafarers teach. Not to abide by this lesson is to be obstinate: here, firmness of character is tainted with stupidity.","Resistance - that is the distinction of the slave. Let your distinction be obedience. Let your commanding itself be obeying!","The State is the coldest of all cold monsters.","Too long, the earth has been a madhouse!","Has a woman who knew she was well-dressed ever caught a cold?","There are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom desistance from life must be preached.","How can anyone become a thinker unless he spends at least a third of every day away from passions, people, and books?","The state lies in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it says, it lies-and whatever it has, it has stolen.","Every society has a tendency to reduce it\'s opponents to caricatures.","Without cruelty there is no festival: thus the longest and most ancient part of human history teaches and in punishment there is so much that is festive!","Heavy, heavy-hearted people grow lighter and rise occasionally to their surface through precisely that which makes others heavier,through hatred and love.","One should not be deceived: great spirits are skeptics ... Strength, FREEDOM which is born of the strength and overstrength of the spirit, proves itself by skepticism. Men of conviction are not worthy of the least consideration in fundamental questions of value and disvalue. Convictions are prisons.","I need solitude, which is to say, recovery, return to my self, the breath of a free, light, playful air.","I love him who desireth not too many virtues. One virtue is more of a virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one\'s destiny to cling to.","I love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his deeds, and always doeth more than he promiseth: for he seeketh his own down-going.","I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may succumb through a small matter: thus goeth he willingly over the bridge.","I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark cloud that lowereth over man: they herald the coming of the lightning, and succumb as heralds.","Alas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any star. Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer despise himself.","The thought is merely a sign, as the word is merely a sign for the thought.","Instruments and playthings are sense and spirit: behind them there is still the Self. The Self seeketh with the eyes of the senses, it hearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit.","One may sometimes tell a lie, but the grimace that accompanies it tells the truth.","He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays and tragic realities.","And if ye cannot be saints of knowledge, then, I pray you, be at least its warriors. They are the companions and forerunners of such saintship.","Your enemy shall ye seek; your war shall ye wage, and for the sake of your thoughts! And if your thoughts succumb, your uprightness shall still shout triumph thereby!","What Europe owes to the Jews? - Many things, good and bad, and above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the grand style in morality, the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands, of infinite significations, the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral questionableness - and consequently just the most attractive, ensnaring, and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life, in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture, its evening sky, now glows - perhaps glows out.","Man must become better and more evil.","I teach you the Overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? ... The time has come for man to set himself a goal. The time has come to plant the seed to his highest hope.","Men are even lazier than they are timorous, and what they fear most is the troubles with which any unconditional honesty and nudity would burden them.","All names of good and evil are images; they do not speak out, they only hint. He is a fool who seeks knowledge from them.","On the rare occasions when our dreams succeed and achieve perfection - most dreams are bungled - the are symbolic chains of scene and images in place of a narrative poetic language; they circumscribe our experiences or expectations or situations with such poetic boldness and decisiveness that in the morning we are always amazed when we remember our dreams.","Though the favourites of the Gods die young, they also live \\n eternally in the company of Gods","Without the errors involved in the assumptions of ethics, man would have remained an animal. Thus has he taken himself as something higher and imposed rigid laws upon himself.","I love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in order that the Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own down-going.","Comparing man and woman on the whole, one may say: woman would not possess a genius for ornamentation if she did not also possessan instinct for the secondary role.","Objectivity and justice have nothing to do with one another.","A letter is an unannounced visit, the postman the agent of rude surprises. One ought to reserve an hour a week for receiving letters and afterwards take a bath.","I love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but wanteth to be wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walketh he as spirit over the bridge.","Has anyone...any distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration? ... There is an ecstasy such that the immese strain of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears, along with which one\'s steps either rush or involuntarily lag, alternately. There is the feeling that one is completely out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of an endless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the very toes... Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of power and divinity.","Existence begins in every instant.","In the true man there is a child concealed who wants to play.","I love him who loveth his virtue: for virtue is the will to down-going, and an arrow of longing.","I love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more.","What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what there is to love in man is that he is a going-over and a going-under.","Those moralists, on the other hand, who, following in the footsteps of Socrates, offer the individual a morality of self-control and temperance as a means to his own advantage, as his personal key to happiness, are the exceptions.","Jealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is jealousy. Even virtues may succumb by jealousy.","History teaches that a race of people is best preserved where the greater number hold one common spirit in consequence of the similarity of their accustomed and indisputable principles.","Ye shall be those whose eyes ever seek for an enemy - for YOUR enemy. And with some of you there is hatred at first sight.","One should not wrongly reify \'cause\' and \'effect,\' as the natural scientists do (and whoever, like them, now \'naturalizes\' in his thinking), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it \'effects\' its end; one should use \'cause\' and \'effect\' only as pure concepts, that is to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and communication-not for explanation.","\\"This - is now my way - where is yours\\"? Thus did I answer those who asked me \\"the way\\". For the way - it does not exist!","It is always consoling to think of suicide: in that way one gets through many a bad night.","Without art we would be nothing but foreground and live entirely in the spell of that perspective which makes what is closest at hand and most vulgar appear as if it were vast, and reality itself.","I have somehow something like \\"influence\\" ... In the Anti-Semitic Correspondence ... my name is mentioned in almost every issue. Zarathustra ... has charmed the anti-Semites; there is a special anti-Semitic interpretation of it that made me laugh very much.","The unlucky hand dealt to clear and precise writers is that people assume they are superficial and so do not go to any trouble inreading them: and the lucky hand dealt to unclear ones is that the reader does go to some trouble and then attributes the pleasure he experiences in his own zeal to them.","Linguistic danger to spiritual freedom.- Every word is a prejudice.","Are you genuine? Or just an actor? A representative? Or what it is that is represented?-In the end, you might merely be someone mimicking an actor ... Second question of conscience.","Nothing is more pathological in our pathological modernity than this disease of Christian pity.","Wherever progress is to ensue, deviating natures are of greatest importance.","Truth is only an illusion we have forgotten is an illusion.","Beggars should be entirely abolished! Truly, it is annoying to give to them and annoying not to give to them.","A man who is very busy seldom changes his opinions.","Do ask yourself why you, the individual, exist, and if you can get no other answer try for once to justify the meaning of your existence as it were a posteriori by setting before yourself an aim, a goal, a \'to this end\', an exalted and noble \'to this end\'.","Some people do not become thinkers simply because their memories are too good.","The pure soul is a pure lie.","We are franker towards others than towards ourselves.","When there is a choice about it, a great sacrifice is preferable to a small sacrifice, because we compensate ourselves for a greatone with self-admiration, which is not possible with a small one.","Ah, there are so many things betwixt heaven and earth of which only the poets have dreamed!","One who is unassuming in dealing with people exhibits his arrogance all the more strongly in dealing with things (city, state, society, age, mankind). That is his revenge.","Everyone becomes brave when he observes one who despairs.","Moralities and religions are the principal means by which one can make whatever one wishes out of man, provided one possesses a superfluity of creative forces and can assert one\'s will over long periods of time in the form of legislation and customs.","Certitude drives people mad.","Contentment preserves one from catching cold. Has a woman who knew that she was well dressed ever caught a cold? No, not even when she had scarcely a rag on her back.","I no longer want to walk on worn soles.","God is Dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown. And we - we still have to vanquish his shadow, too.","Physician, help yourself: thus help your patient too. Let this be his best help: that he may behold with his eyes the man who heals himself.","It is a distinction to have many virtues, but a hard lot.","The moment Germany rises as a great power, France gains a new importance as a cultural power.","The thought of suicide is a great source of comfort: with it a calm passage is to be made across many a bad night.","In every form of womanly love something of motherly love also comes to light.","Which is it? Is man only a blunder of God? Or is God only a blunder of man?","The snake that cannot shed its skin perishes.","God is dead, but considering the state the species man is in, there will perhaps be caves, for ages yet, in which his shadow will be shown.","To produce music is also in a sense to produce children.","Denn was ist Freiheit? Dasz man den Willen zur Selbstverantwortlichkeit hat.","Woman learns how to hate in proportion as she forgets how to charm.","What I really want from Music: That it be cheerful and profound like an afternoon in October.","I have learned to walk: ever since, I let myself run. I have learned to fly: ever since, I do not want to be pushed before moving along.","Wherever Germany extends her sway, she ruins culture.","How much beer is in German intelligence?","Whoever has provoked men to rage against him has always gained a party in his favor, too.","As soon as a religion comes to dominate it has as its opponents all those who would have been its first disciples.","A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at five or six great men- yes, and then to get around them.","I can tell by my own reaction to it that this book is harmful.\\" But let him only wait and perhaps one day he will admit to himself that this same book has done him a great service by bringing out the hidden sickness of his heart and making it visible.\u2014 Altered opinions do not alter a man\u2019s character (or do so very little); but they do illuminate individual aspects of the constellation of his personality which with a different constellation of opinions had hitherto remained dark and unrecognizable.","love as a passion\u2014it is our European specialty\u2014must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its invention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant, ingenious men of the \\"gai saber,\\" to whom Europe owes so much, and almost owes itself.","It may be that until now there has been no more potent means for beautifying man himself than piety: it can turn man into so much art, surface, play of colors, graciousness that his sight no longer makes one suffer.---","Indeed, at hearing the news that \'the old god is dead\', we philosophers and \'free spirits\' feel illuminated by a new dawn; our heart overflows with gratitude, amazement, forebodings, expectation - finally the horizon seems clear again, even if not bright; finally our ships may set out again, set out to face any danger; every daring of the lover of knowledge is allowed again; the sea, our sea, lies open again; maybe there has never been such an \'open sea\'.","What? A great man? I only ever see the ape of his own ideal.","Every word is a prejudice.","I am no man, I am dynamite.","What we know oman today is limited precisely by the extent to which we have regarded him as a machine.","It is only possible through the fact that sympathy for the general life and suffering of mankind is very weakly developed in the individual.","Freedom of opinion is like health; both are individual, and no good general conception can be set up of either of them.","So far there has been no philosopher in whose hands philosophy has not grown into an apology for knowledge; on this point, at least, every one is an optimist, that the greatest usefulness must be ascribed to knowledge. They are all tyrannized over by logic, and this is optimism in its essence.","Man is more sensitive to the contempt of others than to self-contempt.","When a scholar of the old culture vows no longer to have anything to do with men who believe in progress, he is right. For the old culture has its greatness and goodness behind it, and an historical education forces one to admit that it can never again be fresh.","Men submit from habit to everything that seeks power.","Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer, than into the dreams of a lustful woman?","Chastity is a virtue with some, but with many it is almost a vice.","The radical hostility, the deadly hostility against sensuality, is always a symptom to reflect on: it entitles us to suppositions concerning the total state of one who is excessive in this manner.","The degree and kind of a man\'s sexuality reach up into the ultimate pinnacle of his spirit.","This demand follows from an insight that I was the first to articulate: that there are no moral facts.","Morality makes stupid.- Custom represents the experiences of men of earlier times as to what they supposed useful and harmful - but the sense for custom (morality) applies, not to these experiences as such, but to the age, the sanctity, the indiscussability of the custom. And so this feeling is a hindrance to the acquisition of new experiences and the correction of customs: that is to say, morality is a hindrance to the development of new and better customs: it makes stupid.","Whoever has overthrown an existing law of custom has always first been accounted a bad man: but when, as did happen, the law could not afterwards be reinstated and this fact was accepted, the predicate gradually changed; - history treats almost exclusively of these bad men who subsequently became good men!","Whatever we have words for, that we have already got beyond.","The patient. The pine tree seems to listen, the fir tree to wait: and both without impatience: - they give no thought to the little people beneath them devoured by their impatience and their curiosity.","When Zarathustra was alone . . . he said to his heart: \\"Could it be possible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that God is dead!\\"","Fall down seven times, stand up eight. - Chinese proverbWithout music, life would be a mistake.","The strength required for the vision of the most powerful reality is not only compatible with the most powerful strength for action, for monstrous action, for crime - it even presupposes it.","And so while dreams are the individual man\'s play with reality, the sculptor\'s art is (in a broader sense) the play with dreams.","One will rarely err if extreme actions be ascribed to vanity, ordinary actions to habit, and mean actions to fear.","The value of a man can only be measured with regard to other men.","Life, and you, and I, and all of us together became for a while interesing to ourselves once more.","Ah, how little you know of human happiness - you comfortable and benevolent people! For happiness and unhappiness are brother and sister - or even twins who grow up together - or in your case - remain small together!","To have to fight the instincts - that is the definition of decadence: as long as life is ascending, happiness equals instinct.","When one rows it is not the rowing which moves the ship: rowing is only a magical ceremony by means of which one compels a demon to move the ship.","The relatives of a suicide hold it against him that out of consideration for their reputation he did not remain alive.","\\"State,\\" I call it, where they all drink poison, the good and the wicked; \\"state,\\" where they all lose themselves, the good and the wicked; \\"state,\\" where they all call their slow suicide-\\"life.\\"","Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else when they sought Teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought for themselves, and poppy-head virtues to promote it! To all those be-lauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep Without dreams: they knew no higher significance of life. Even at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not always so honorable: but their time is past.  And not much longer do they stand: there they already lie. Blessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to sleep.-Thus spoke Zarathustra.","God created woman. And boredom did indeed cease from that moment-but many other things ceased as well!","If a man have a strong faith he can indulge in the luxury of skepticism.","Good prose is written only face to face with poetry.","Christianity is a metaphysics of the hangman.","At the bottom of all these noble races the beast of prey, the splendid blond beast, prowling about avidly in search of spoil and victory.","That grand drama in a hundred acts, which is reserved for the next two centuries of Europe-the most terrible, most questionable and perhaps also the most hopeful of all dramas.","I am not bigoted enough for a system-and not even for my system.","You lovers of knowledge! So what have you done out of your love of knowledge up to now? Have you already stolen and murdered so as to know how a thief and a murderer feels?","Metaphysical world.- It is true, there could be a metaphysical world; the absolute possibility of it is hardly to be disputed. We behold all things through the human head and cannot cut off this head; while the question nonetheless remains what of the world would still be there if one had cut it off.","History is nothing more than the belief in the senses, the belief in falsehood.","It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable.","The so called unconscious inferences can be traced back to the all-preserving memory, which presents us with parallel experiences and hence already knows the consequences of an action. It is not anticipation of the effects; rather, it is the feeling: identical causes, identical effects . . .","Let woman be a plaything, pure and fine, like a precious stone, illumined with the virtues of a world not yet come.","It was modesty that invented the word \\"philosopher\\" in Greece and left the magnificent overweening presumption in calling oneselfwise to the actors of the spirit--the modesty of such monsters of pride and sovereignty as Pythagoras, as Plato.","Could truth perhaps be a woman who has reasons for not permitting her reasons to be seen? Could her name perhaps be--to speak Greek--Baubo?... Oh, those Greeks! They understood how to live: to do that it is necessary to stop bravely at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore the appearance, to believe in forms, in tones, in words, in the whole Olympus of appearance! Those Greeks were superficial--out of profundity!","In his lonely solitude, the solitary man feeds upon himself; in the thronging multitude, the many feed upon him. Now choose.","But let me open up my heart to you completely, my friends: if there were gods, how could I bear not being a god! Hence, there areno gods. I drew this conclusion, to be sure--but now it draws me.","Precisely this is godliness--that there are gods, but no God.","The way to transmute your iron duty into gold in everyone\'s eyes is this: always deliver more than you promise.","He who possesses greatness is cruel towards his secondary virtues and considerations.","If a man wishes to become a hero, then the serpent must first become a dragon: otherwise he lacks his proper enemy.","When we have a great goal we are superior even to justice, not merely to our deeds and our judges.","He who is usually self-sufficient becomes exceptionally vain and keenly alive to fame and praise when he is physically ill. The more he loses himself the more he has to endeavor to regain his position by means of the opinion of others.","For some natures, changing their opinions is just as much a requirement of cleanliness as changing their clothes: for others, however, it is merely a requirement of vanity.","The purpose of punishment is to improve those who do the punishing--that is the final recourse of those who support punishment.","This mother needs happy, reputable children, and that one needs unhappy ones: otherwise she cannot show her kindness as a mother.","Yes, life is a woman!","Envy and jealousy are the private parts of the human soul. Perhaps the comparison can be extended.","Do not be deceived! The busiest people harbor the greatest weariness, their restlessness is weakness--they no longer have the capacity for waiting and idleness.","The one seeks a midwife to deliver his thoughts, the other, someone to assist: thus a good conversation comes into being.","Whether in conversation we generally agree or disagree with others is largely a matter of habit: the one tendency makes as much sense as the other.","And so do you suppose it must be a piece-work because it has been given to you (and could only be given to you) in pieces?","Sometimes we remain true to a cause simply because its opponents are unfailingly tasteless.","When a man reaches his maturity in understanding and in years, the feeling comes over him that his father was wrong to beget him.","In Bach there is still too much crude Christianity, crude Germanism, crude scholasticism; he stands on the threshold of European (modern) music, but he looks back from there to the Middle Ages.","Whoever gives advice to the sick gains a sense of superiority over them, no matter whether his advice is accepted or rejected. That is why sick people who are sensitive and proud hate their advisors even more than their illnesses.","I admire the courage and wisdom of Socrates in everything he did, said--and did not say.","We feign pity when we want to demonstrate our ascendancy over feelings of hostility: but usually in vain. Whenever we notice this,there is an accompanying surge in those hostile sensations.","Do you suppose that sacrifice is the hallmark of moral action?--Just stop to consider whether sacrifice is not involved in every action that is done with deliberation, the worst as well as the best.","This is the crux of the moral pessimists: if they really wanted to promote their neighbor\'s redemption, then they would have to resolve themselves to spoiling existence for him, and thus to being his misfortune; out of pity, they would have to--become evil!","Immortal is the moment when I engendered the recurrence. For the sake of this moment I bear the recurrence.","Many things about man are not very godly: whenever a person excretes feces, how can he be a god then? But it is even worse regarding the other feces we call sin: man still surely wants to retain this, and not excrete it. Now however, I must believe it: a person can be God and still excrete feces. Thus I teach you, excrete your feces and become gods.","Nothing can be done about it: every master has but a single pupil--and he will not stay loyal to him--for he is also destined to become a master.","[Heraclitus\' language] dispenses with lightness and artificial decoration, foremost out of disgust for humanity and out of [his own] defiant feeling.","Is man God\'s biggest blunder, or is man\'s God?","That little hypocrites and half-crazed people dare to imagine that on their account the laws of nature are constantly broken; such an enhancement of every kind of selfishness to infinity, to impudence, cannot be branded with sufficient contempt. And yet Christianity owes its triumph to this pitiable flattery of personal vanity.","Many die too late, and some die too early. Yet strangers soundeth the precept: \\"Die at the right time!\\"","Master-morality and Slave-morality.","Whoever gives advice to a sick person acquires a feeling of superiority over him, whether the advice be accepted or rejected.","Praise is more obtrusive than a reproach.","To be moral, correct, and virtuous is to be obedient to an old established law and custom.","Without the errors which lie in the assumption of morality, man would have remained an animal.","Whoever thinks much and to good purpose easily forgets his own experiences, but not the thoughts which these experiences have called forth.","Inexperienced girls flatter themselves with the notion that it is in their power to make a man happy.","We are more pained when one of our friends is guilty of something shameful than when we do it ourselves.","The Refinement of Shame. People are not ashamed to think something foul, but they are ashamed when they think these foul thoughts are attributed to them.","One unconsciously takes it for granted that doer and sufferer think and feel alike, and according to this supposition we measure the guilt of the one by the pain of the other.","It is only because man believes himself to be free, not because he is free, that he experiences remorse and pricks of conscience.","No honey is sweeter than that of knowledge.","Nobody thanks a witty man for politeness when he puts himself on a par with a society in which it would not be polite to show one\'s wit.","One should not go into churches if one wants to breathe pure air.","One will seldom go wrong if one attributes extreme actions to vanity, average ones to habit, and pretty ones to fear.","The most fatal seductive lie that has yet existed","One is most dishonest to one\'s god: he is not allowed to sin.","All religions bear traces of the fact that they arose during the intellectual immaturity of the human race - before it had learned the obligations to speak the truth.  Not one of them makes it the duty of its god to be truthful and understandable in his communications.","We must beware of one who is in a passion against us as of one who has once sought our life; for the fact that we still live is due to the absence of power to kill, - if looks could kill, we should have been dead long ago.","Among human beings there is no greater banality than death. Second in order, because it is possible to die without being born, comes birth, and next comes marriage.","Madness is the exception in individuals but the rule in groups.","Not by wrath does one kill, but by laughter.","In true love it is the soul that envelops the body.","Even in the lust of knowledge I feel only my will\'s delight in begetting and becoming; and if there be innocence in my knowledge it is because my procreative will is in it.","It is neither the best nor the worst things in a book that defy translation.","Man is something to be surpassed.","Such a man as instinctively feeds on pure ambrosia and leaves alone the indigestible in things.","Remain true to the earth.","Does not the discipline of the scientific spirit just commence when one no longer harbours any conviction?","Doing ill to those on whom we have to make our power felt; for pain is a far more sensitive means for that purpose than pleasure: pain always asks concerning the cause, while pleasure is inclined to keep within itself and not look backward.","I have given a name to my pain, and call it \\"dog\\".","The ability to suffer is a small matter - weak women and even slaves can acheive virtuosity in that.","He who bears injustice alone is terrible to behold.","The governments of the great States have two instruments for keeping the people dependent, in fear and obedience: a coarser, the army; and a more refined, the school.","THE SLOW ARROW OF BEAUTY. The noblest kind of beauty is that which does not transport us suddenly, which does not make stormy and intoxicating impressions such a kind easily arouses disgust but that which slowly filters into our minds.","THE SUFFERING OF GENIUS AND ITS VALUE. The artistic genius desires to give pleasure, but if his mind is on a very high plane he does not easily find anyone to share his pleasure; he offers entertainment but nobody accepts it. That gives him, in certain circumstances, a comically touching pathos; for he has no right to force pleasure on men. He pipes, but none will dance: can that be tragic?","The job of rearing a child consists of making conscious activities unconscious.","When we think of all the things we want to do with our other half the answer should be simple; we should want to do absolutely everything with them. We should want to experience everything, feel everything, see everything with no one but them by our sides. When we look back on our lives it\'s not the things we did do with them that we\'ll regret, it\'s the things we didn\'t do.","Science and art have that in common that everyday things seem to them new and attractive.","Most of the time in married life is taken up by talk.","If married couples did not live together, happy marriages would be more frequent.","A beautiful woman seductively dressed will never catch cold no matter how low-cut her gown.","The happiness of man is: I will. The happiness of woman is: he wills.","Human, all too human.","To go on vegetating in cowardly dependence on physicians and machinations, after the meaning of life, the right to life, has been lost, that ought to prompt a profound contempt in society.","The Antichrist, Section 7","The ascetic makes a necessity of virtue.","The charm of knowledge would be small indeed, were it not that there is so much shame to be overcome on the way to it.","Today a man of knowledge might well feel as though he were God transformed into an animal.","We no longer love our knowledge enough once we have passed it on.","Only with the ultimate knowledge of all things will man have come to know himself. For things are but the boundaries of man.","How do you expect to learn to dance when you have not even learned to walk! And above the dancer is still the flyer and his bliss.","It is no doubt possible to fly--but first you must know how to dance like an angel.","I teach the No to all that makes weak--that exhausts. I teach the Yes to all that strengthens, that stores up strength, that pride.","Assuming that rapture is nature\'s play with man, the Dionysian artist\'s creative activity is the play with rapture.","Love brings to light the lofty and hidden characteristics of the lover--what is rare and exceptional in him: to that extent it caneasily be deceptive with respect to what is normal in him.","Sometimes it just takes stronger eyeglasses to cure those who are in love--and someone with the ability to imagine a face or a figure twenty years older might perhaps pass through life quite undisturbed.","For it is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified.","Time, space, and causality are only metaphors of knowledge, with which we explain things to ourselves.","Mathematics is merely the means to a general and ultimate knowledge of man.","Noble and wise men once believed in the music of the spheres: noble and wise men still continue to believe in the \\"moral significance of existence.\\" But one day even this sphere-music will no longer be audible to them! They will wake up and take note that their ears were dreaming.","Our drives are reducible to the will to power. The will to power is the ultimate fact at which we arrive.","The will to power can express itself only against resistances; it seeks that which resists it--this is the native tendency of theamoeba when it extends its pseudopodia and gropes around.","The problem of culture is seldom grasped correctly. The goal of a culture is not the greatest possible happiness of a people, noris it the unhindered development of all their talents; instead, culture shows itself in the correct proportion of these developments. Its aim points beyond earthly happiness: the production of great works is the aim of culture.","Carlyle, a man of strong words and attitudes, a rhetorician out of necessity, constantly aroused by the craving for a strong faithas well as by the feeling of an incapacity for it (Min this respect a typical romantic!).... Fundamentally, Carlyle is an English atheist who makes it a point of honor not to be one.","Antithesis is the narrow gateway through which error most prefers to worm its way towards truth.","Truth is the kind of error without which a certain species of life could not live. The value for life is ultimately decisive.","Many a peacock hides his peacock tail from all eyes--and calls it his pride.","Among twelve apostles there must always be one who is as hard as stone, so that the new church may be built upon him.","One who has given up any hope of winning a fight or has clearly lost it wants his style in fighting to be admired all the more.","One should only question gods where none but gods can reply.","...If I continued to harbour any hope for music it lay in the expectation that a musician might come who was sufficiently bold, subtle, malicious, southerly, superhealthy to confront that music and in an immortal fashion take revenge on it.","There are no limits to God\'s compassion with Paradises over their one universally felt want: he immediately created other animals besides. God\'s first blunder: Man didn\'t find the animals amusing, - he dominated them and didn\'t even want to be an \'animal.\'","The criminal type is the type of the strong human being under unfavorable circumstances: a strong human being made sick.","What doesn\'t kill you make you stronger.","What can everyone do? Praise and blame. This is human virtue, this is human madness.","What do you regard as most humane? To spare someone shame.","In the consciousness of the truth he has perceived, man now sees everywhere only the awfulness or the absurdity of existence and loathing seizes him.","There is an innocence in admiration; it is found in those to whom it has never yet occurred that they, too, might be admired some day.","Existence really is an imperfect tense that never becomes a present.","He who laughs best today, will also laughs last.","Whoever has witnessed another\'s ideal becomes his inexorable judge and as it were his evil conscience.","They\'re so cold, these scholars! May lightning strike their food so that their mouths learn how to eat fire!","No one dies of fatal truths nowadays: there are too many antidotes.","Was that life? Well then, once more!","Ten truths must you find during the day; otherwise will you seek truth during the night, and your soul will have been hungry.","Human life is inexplicable, and still without meaning: a fool may decide its fate.","Only ideas won by walking have any value.","Books and drafts mean something quite different for different thinkers. One collects in a book the lights he was able to steal and carry home swiftly out of the rays of some insight that suddenly dawned on him, while another thinker offers us nothing but shadows - images in black and grey of what had built up in his soul the day before.","The consequences of our actions take hold of us, quite indifferent to our claim that meanwhile we have \'improved.","Thus the man who is responsive to artistic stimuli reacts to the reality of dreams as does the philosopher to the reality of existence; he observes closely, and he enjoys his observation: for it is out of these images that he interprets life, out of these processes that he trains himself for life.","It is so little true that martyrs offer any support to the truth of a cause that I am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything to do with the truth at all.","Let that day be lost to us on which we did not dance once!","These four, however, seek the freedom of their will at the very point where they are most securely chained. It is as if the silkworm sought freedom of will in spinning. What is the reason?","Beyond Good and Evil, Aphorism 153","The soul must have its chosen sewers to carry away its ordure. This function is performed by persons, relationships, professions, the fatherland, the world, or finally, for the really arrogant - I mean our modern pessimists - by the Good God himself.","He that humbleth himself wishes to be exalted.","Nothing has been purchased more dearly than the little bit of reason and sense of freedom which now constitutes our pride.","Necessity is not an established fact, but an interpretation.","It is the most sensual men who need to flee women and torment their bodies.","When one does away with oneself one does the most estimable thing possible: one thereby almost deserves to live.","The aphorism, the apothegm, in which I am the first among the Germans to be a master, are the forms of \u201ceternity\u201d; it is my ambition to say in ten sentences what everyone else says in a book \u2014 what everyone else does not say in a book.","At heart I am a warrior.","It is not enough to prove something, one also has to seduce or elevate people to it. That is why the man of knowledge should learns how to speak his wisdom: and often in such a way that it sounds like folly!","All human life is sunk deep in untruth; the individual cannot pull it out of this well without growing profoundly annoyed with his entire past, without finding his present motives (like honor) senseless, and without opposing scorn and disdain to the passions that urge one on to the future and to the happiness in it.","Wherever primitive man put up a word, he believed he had made a discovery. How utterly mistaken he really was! He had touched a problem, and while supposing he had solved it, he had created and obstacle to its solution. Now, with every new knowledge we stumble over flint-like and petrified words and, in so doing, break a leg sooner than a word.","The priest knows, as every one knows, that there is no longer any \\"God,\\" or any \\"sinner,\\" or any \\"Saviour\\" that \\"free will\\" and the \\"moral order of the world\\" are lies : serious reflection, the profound self conquest of the spirit, allow no man to pretend that he does not know it.","Morality in Europe today is herd-morality","Winter, a bad guest, sitteth with me at home; blue are my hands with his friendly handshaking","I desire that your conjectures should not reach beyond your creative will. Could you create a god? Then do not speak to me of any gods.","Not joy is the mother of dissipation, but joylessness.","I teach you the Overman. Man is something which shall be surpassed.","A few hours\' mountain climbing make of a rogue and a saint two fairly equal creatures. Tiredness is the shortest path to equality and fraternity - and sleep finally adds to them liberty.","In order to be able thus to misjudge, and thus to grant left-handed veneration to our classics, people must have ceased to know them. This, generally speaking, is precisely what has happened. For, otherwise, one ought to know that there is only one way of honoring them, and that is to continue seeking with the same spirit and with the same courage, and not to weary of the search.","It is difficult to preach, this morality of mediocrity! It may never admit what it is and what it wants! It must speak about restraint and worth and duty and love of one\'s neighbor.","There is something laughable about the sight of authors who enjoy the rustling folds of long and involved sentences: they are trying to cover up their feet.","O, what nowadays does science not conceal! How much, at least, it is meant to conceal!","The stronger becomes master of the weaker, in so far as the latter cannot assert its degree of independence here there is no mercy, no forbearance, even less a respect for \\"laws.","A woman does not want the truth; what is truth to women? From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than the truth - her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance and beauty.","The reason adultery is immoral is that it might lead to marriage.","Every word has its fragrance: there is a harmony and a disharmony of fragrances, and hence of words.","The gilded sheath of pity sometimes covers the dagger of envy.","In affability there is no hatred of men, but for that very reason there is all too much contempt for men.","Annoyance is a physical malady that is in no way cured just because the annoying situation that causes it is eliminated.","He who bestows something great receives no gratitude; for in accepting it the recipient has already been weighed down too much.","The weak and misbegotten shall perish: first principle of our brotherly love. And they shall be given every assistance.","The mouth may lie, alright, but the face it makes nonetheless tells the truth.","The truthful man ends up realizing that he always lies.","Perhaps no one as yet has been truthful enough about what \\"truthfulness\\" is.","They climb the mountain like beasts, stupid and sweating; it seems that no one bothered to tell them that there are beautiful vistas along the way.","Having become conscious of the truth he once perceived, man now sees only the awfulness or the absurdity of existence, he now understands the symbolic element in Ophelia\'s fate, he now recognizes the wisdom of the woodland god, Silenus: it nauseates him.","A refined soul is distressed to know that someone owes it thanks; a crude soul, to know that it owes someone thanks.","When anyone apologizes to us he has to do it very expertly: otherwise we might easily come to see ourselves as the guilty party and experience unpleasant feelings.","A reader is doubly guilty of bad manners against an author when he praises his second book at the expense of his first (or vice versa) and then expects the author to be grateful for what he has done.","Active, successful natures act, not according to the maxim, \\"know thyself,\\" but as if prompted by the commandment: will a self, and so become a self.","Childhood and youth are ends in themselves, not stages.","The dyed-in-the-wool teacher takes everything seriously only with respect to his students--himself included.","In morality, man treats himself not as individuum but as dividuum.","Higher than \\"thou shalt\\" stands \\"I will\\" (the heroes), and higher than \\"I will\\" stands \\"I am\\" (the Greek gods).","In the end we love our desire and not what it is that we desire.","Good deeds shun the light as anxiously as evil deeds: the latter fear that disclosure will bring on pain (as punishment), while the former fear that disclosure will take away pleasure (that pure pleasure, that pleasure per se, which immediately ceases once the vanity\'s satisfaction is added).","The arrogance that accompanies merit offends us even more than the arrogance of people who are lacking in merit: since merit itself offends us.","In Russia there is an emigration of intelligence: \xe9migr\xe9s cross the frontier in order to read and to write good books. But in doing so they contribute to making their fatherland, abandoned by spirit, into the gaping jaws of Asia that would like to swallow our little Europe.","The condition that gives birth to a rule is not the same as the condition to which the rule gives birth.","And many such good inventions are there, that they are like woman\'s breasts: useful at the same time, and pleasant.","What verse is for the poet, dialectical thinking is for the philosopher. He grasps for it in order to get hold of his own enchantment, in order to perpetuate it.","Every god-man created his own god: and there is no worse enmity on earth than that between gods.","Science offends the modesty of all real women. It makes them feel as though it were an attempt to peek under their skin--or, worseyet, under their dress and ornamentation!","Out of love, women become entirely what it is that they are in the imaginations of the men who love them.","Thus do I want man and woman to be: the one fit to wage war and the other fit to give birth, but both fit to dance with head and feet.","The higher its type, the more rarely a thing succeeds.","A matter that becomes clear ceases to concern us.--What was that god thinking who counseled, \\"Know thyself!\\" Did he perhaps mean,\\"Cease to concern yourself! Become objective!\\"--And Socrates?--And \\"scientific men\\"?","A thing can only live through a pious illusion.","One can lie with the mouth, but with the accompanying grimace one nevertheless tells the truth.","When you stare into an abyss for a long time, the abyss also stares into you.","Many find their heart when they have lost their head.","Generally speaking, the greater a woman\'s beauty, the greater her modesty.","And you tell me, friends, that there is no disputing taste and tasting?

In the end we are always rewarded for our good will, our patience, fairmindedness, and gentleness with what is strange; gradually, it sheds its veil and turns out to be a new and indescribable beauty:\u2014that is its thanks for our hospitality.

A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting. What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is lovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING. I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they are the over-goers. I love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and arrows of longing for the other shore. I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive. I love him who lives in order to know, and seeks to know in order that the Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeks he his own down-going. I love him who labors and invents, that he may build the house for the Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, and plant: for thus seeks he his own down-going. I love him who loves his virtue: for virtue is the will to down-going, and an arrow of longing. I love him who reserves no share of spirit for himself, but wants to be wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walks he as spirit over the bridge. I love him who makes his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more. I love him who desires not too many virtues. One virtue is more of a virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one\'s destiny to cling to. I love him whose soul is lavish, who wants no thanks and does not give back: for he always bestows, and desires not to keep for himself. I love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favor, and who then asks: \\"Am I a dishonest player?\\"--for he is willing to succumb. I love him who scatters golden words in advance of his deeds, and always does more than he promises: for he seeks his own down-going. I love him who justifies the future ones, and redeems the past ones: for he is willing to succumb through the present ones. I love him who chastens his God, because he loves his God: for he must succumb through the wrath of his God. I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may succumb through a small matter: thus goes he willingly over the bridge. I love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgets himself, and all things that are in him: thus all things become his down-going. I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus is his head only the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causes his down-going. I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark cloud that lowers over man: they herald the coming of the lightning, and succumb as heralds. Lo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud: the lightning, however, is the SUPERMAN.--","Live dangerously.","When you stare into the abyss the abyss stares back at you.","It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor sympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men!","All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity.","Love is blind. Friendship closes its eyes.","The most spiritual men, as the strongest, find their happiness where others would find their destruction: in the labyrinth, in hardness against themselves and others, in experiments. Their joy is self-conquest: asceticism becomes in them nature, need, and instinct. Difficult tasks are a privilege to them; to play with burdens that crush others, a recreation. Knowledge\u2013a form of asceticism. They are the most venerable kind of man: that does not preclude their being the most cheerful and the kindliest.","The heaviest burden: \u201cWhat, if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: \u2018This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh\u2026 must return to you\u2014all in the same succession and sequence\u2014even this spider and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over again and again\u2014and you with it, speck of dust!\u2019 Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: \u2018You are a god, and never have I heard anything more divine!\u2019 If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change you as you are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, \u201cdo you want this once more and innumerable times more? would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight. Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?\u201d","Man muss noch Chaos in sich haben, um einen tanzenden Stern geb\xe4ren zu k\xf6nnen.

Another century of readers--and spirit itself will stink.Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not only writing but also thinking.Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace.He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read, but learnt by heart.In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall.The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched.I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The courage which scareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins--it wanteth to laugh.","He who cannot put his thoughts on ice should not enter into the heat of dispute.","You know these things as thoughts, but your thoughts are not your experiences, they are an echo and after-effect of your experiences: as when your room trembles whe na carriage goes past. I however am sitting in the carriage, and often I am the carriage itself.Ina man who thinks like this, the dichotomy between thinking and feeling, intellect and passion, has really disappeared. He feels his thoughts. He can fall in love with an idea. An idea can make him ill.","Of all that is written I love only what a man has written in his own blood.","You desire to LIVE \\"according to Nature\\"? Oh, you noble Stoics, what fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power\u2014how COULD you live in accordance with such indifference? To live\u2014is not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing, preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different? And granted that your imperative, \\"living according to Nature,\\" means actually the same as \\"living according to life\\"\u2014how could you do DIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature, you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be Nature \\"according to the Stoa,\\" and would like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal glorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwise\u2014and to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves\u2014Stoicism is self-tyranny\u2014Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to \\"creation of the world,\\" the will to the causa prima.","A politician divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies.","The real man wants two different things: danger and play.

The most noble kind of beauty is that which does not carry us away suddenly, whose attacks are not violent or intoxicating (this kind easily awakens disgust), but rather the kind of beauty which infiltrates slowly, which we carry along with us almost unnoticed, and meet up with again in dreams; finally, after it has for a long time lain modestly in our heart, it takes complete possession of us, filling our eyes with tears, our hearts with longing.

Knowledge kills action; action requires the veils of illusion: that is the doctrine of Hamlet, not that cheap wisdom of Jack the Dreamer who reflects too much and, as it were, from an excess of possibilities does not get around to action. Not reflection, no--true knowledge, an insight into the horrible truth, outweighs any motive for action, both in Hamlet and in the Dionysian man.Now no comfort avails any more; longing transcends a world after death, even the gods; existence is negated along with its glittering reflection in the gods or in an immortal beyond. Conscious of the truth he has once seen, man now sees everywhere only the horror or absurdity of existence; now he understands what is symbolic in Ophelia\'s fate; now he understands the wisdom of the sylvan god, Silenus: he is nauseated.Here, when the danger to his will is greatest, art approaches as a saving sorceress, expert at healing. She alone knows how to turn these nauseous thoughts about the horror or absurdity of existence into notions with which one can live: these are the sublime as the artistic taming of the horrible, and the comic as the artistic discharge of the nausea of absurdity. The satyr chorus of the dithyramb is the saving deed of Greek art; faced with the intermediary world of these Dionysian companions, the feelings described here exhausted themselves.","You tell me: \'Life is hard to bear.\' But if it were otherwise why should you have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?Life is hard to bear: but do not pretend to be so tender!

It is always as in the last moment before the departure of an emigrant- ship: people have more than ever to say to one another, the hour presses, the ocean with its lonely silence waits impatiently behind all the noise-so greedy, so certain of its prey! And all, all, suppose that the past has been nothing, or a small matter, that the near future is everything: hence this haste, this crying, this self-deafening and self-overreaching! Everyone wants to be foremost in this future-and yet death and the stillness of death are the only things certain and common to all in this future! How strange that this sole thing that is certain and common to all, exercises almost no influence on men, and that they are the furthest from regarding themselves as the brotherhood of death!

How little you know of human happiness, you comfortable and benevolent people, for happiness and unhappiness are sisters and even twins that either grow up together or, as in your case, remain small together.","it is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified.","There is something quite amazing and monstrous about the education of upper-class women. What could be more paradoxical? All the world is agreed that they are to be brought up as ignorant as possible of erotic matters, and that one has to imbue their souls with a profound sense of shame in such matters until the merest suggestion of such things triggers the most extreme impatience and flight. The \\"honor\\" of women really comes into play only here: what else would one not forgive them? But here they are supposed to remain ignorant even in their hearts: they are supposed to have neither eyes nor ears, nor words, nor thoughts for this -- their \\"evil;\\" and mere knowledge is considered evil. And then to be hurled as by a gruesome lightning bolt, into reality and knowledge, by marriage -- precisely by the man they love and esteem most! To catch love and shame in a contradiction and to be forced to experience at the same time delight, surrender, duty, pity, terror, and who knows what else, in the face of the unexpected neighborliness of god and beast!Thus a psychic knot has been tied that may have no equal. Even the compassionate curiosity of the wisest student of humanity is inadequate for guessing how this or that woman manages to accommodate herself to this solution of the riddle, and to the riddle of a solution, and what dreadful, far-reaching suspicions must stir in her poor, unhinged soul -- and how the ultimate philosophy and skepsis of woman casts anchor at this point!Afterward, the same deep silence as before. Often a silence directed at herself, too. She closes her eyes to herself.Young women try hard to appear superficial and thoughtless. The most refined simulate a kind of impertinence.Women easily experience their husbands as a question mark concerning their honor, and their children as an apology or atonement. They need children and wish for them in a way that is altogether different from that in which a man may wish for children.In sum, one cannot be too kind about women.","Those who hear not the music think the dancers mad.","Every profound spirit needs a mask","Try for once to justify the meaning of your existence as it were a posteriori by setting yourself an aim, a goal... an exalted and noble \'to this end.\' Perish in pursuit of this and only this","Pity preserves things that are ripe for decline, it defends things that have been disowned and condemned by life, and it gives a depressive and questionable character to life itself by keeping alive an abundance of failures of every type.

Schopenhauer was right here: pity negates life, it makes life worthy of negation, - pity is the practice of nihilism. Once more: this depressive and contagious instinct runs counter to the instincts that preserve and enhance the value of life: by multiplying misery just as much as by conserving everything miserable, pity is one of the main tools used to increase decadence - pity wins people over to nothingness! \u2026 You do not say \u2018nothingness\u2019 : instead you say \u2018the beyond\u2019; or \u2018God\u2019; or \u2018the true life\u2019; or nirvana, salvation, blessedness \u2026 This innocent rhetoric from the realm of religious-moral idiosyncrasy suddenly appears much less innocent when you see precisely which tendencies are wrapped up inside these sublime words: tendencies hostile to life.","Suppose a human being has thus put his ear, as it were, to the heart chamber of the world will and felt the roaring desire for existence pouring from there into all the veins of the world, as a thundering current or as the gentlest brook, dissolving into a mist\u2014how could he fail to break suddenly?

His soul squints; his spirit loves hiding places, secret paths and back doors, everything covert entices him as his world, his security, his refreshment; he understands how to keep silent, how not to forget, how to wait, how to be provisionally self-deprecating and humble. A race of such men of ressentiment is bound to become eventually cleverer than any noble race; it will also honor cleverness to a far greater degree: namely, as a condition of existence of the first importance; while with noble men cleverness can easily acquire a subtle flavor of luxury and subtlety\u2014for here it is far less essential than the perfect functioning of the regulating unconscious instincts or even than a certain imprudence, perhaps a bold recklessness whether in the face of danger or of the enemy, or that enthusiastic impulsiveness in anger, love, reverence, gratitude, and revenge by which noble souls have at all times recognized one another. Ressentiment itself, if it should appear in the noble man, consummates and exhausts itself in an immediate reaction, and therefore does not poison: on the other hand, it fails to appear at all on countless occasions on which it inevitably appears in the weak and impotent.","The most intelligent men, like the strongest, find their happiness where others would find only disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct.

In other words, the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who commands severely\u2014a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience. From this one might perhaps gather that the two world religions, Buddhism and Christianity, may have owed their origin and above all their sudden spread to a tremendous collapse and disease of the will. And that is what actually happened: both religions encountered a situation in which the will had become diseased, giving rise to a demand that had become utterly desperate for some \\"thou shalt.\\" Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had become exhausted, and thus they offered innumerable people some support, a new possibility of willing, some delight in willing. For fanaticism is the only \\"strength of the will\\" that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain, being a sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an excessive nourishment (hypertrophy) of a single point of view and feeling that henceforth becomes dominant\u2014 which the Christian calls his faith. Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded, he becomes \\"a believer.\\"Conversely, one could conceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a freedom of the will [ This conception of \\"freedom of the will\\" ( alias, autonomy) does not involve any belief in what Nietzsche called \\"the superstition of free will\\" in section 345 ( alias, the exemption of human actions from an otherwise universal determinism).] that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing even near abysses. Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence.","Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing. That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of \\"world history,\\" but nevertheless, it was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled and congealed, and the clever beasts had to die. One might invent such a fable, and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable, how shadowy and transient, how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature. There were eternities during which it did not exist. And when it is all over with the human intellect, nothing will have happened.","Where has God gone? [the madman asked] \u201cI shall tell you.

To the extent that man has for long ages believed in the concepts and names of things as in aeternae veritates he has appropriated to himself that pride by which he raised himself above the animal: he really thought that in language he possessed knowledge of the world. The sculptor of language was not so modest as to believe that he was only giving things designations, he conceived rather that with words he was expressing supreame knowledge of things; language is, in fact, the first stage of occupation with science. Here, too, it is the belief that the truth has been found out of which the mightiest sources of energy have flowed. A great deal later - only now - it dawns on men that in their belief in language they have propagated a tremendous error. Happily, it is too late for the evolution of reason, which depends on this belief, to be put back. - Logic too depends on presuppositions with which nothing in the real world corresponds, for example on the presupposition that there are identical things, that the same thing is identical at different points of time: but this science came into existence through the opposite belief (that such conditions do obtain in the real world). It is the same with mathematics, which would certainly not have come into existence if one had known from the beginning that there was in nature no exactly straight line, no real circle, no absolute magnitude.","What does our great historical hunger signify, our clutching about us of countless cultures, our consuming desire for knowledge, if not the loss of myth, of a mythic home, the mythic womb?","We laugh at a man who, stepping out of his room at the very minute when the sun is rising, says, \u201cIt is my will that the sun shall rise; or at him who, unable to stop a wheel, says, \u201cI wish it to roll\u201d; or, again, at him who, thrown in a wrestling match, says, \u201cHere I lie, but here I wish to lie.\u201d But, joking apart, do we not act like one of these three persons whenever we use the expression \u201cI wish\u201d?\u201d","the lie is a condition of life.","\u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0623\u0634\u0643\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0647\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0646\u0633\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f","In conversation we are sometimes confused by the tone of our own voice, and mislead to make assertions that do not at all correspond to our opinions.","The greatest weight.-- What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: \\"This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence - even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself.

To prepare the way for these creations all one has to do is to go on writing history from the standpoint of the masses and seeking to derive the laws which govern it from the needs of these masses, that is to say from the laws which move the lowest mud- and clay-strata of society. The masses seem to me to deserve notice in three respects only: first as faded copies of great men produced on poor paper with worn-out plates, then as a force of resistance to great men, finally as instruments in the hands of great men; for the rest, let the Devil and statistics take them!","\u0625\u0630 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b","He whom the flame of jealousy encompasses, will at last, like the scorpion, turn the poisoned sting against himself.","It was suffering and incapacity that created all afterworlds - this, and that brief madness of bliss which is experienced only by those who suffer deeply.

But one thing will live, the monogram of their most essential being, a work, an act, a piece of rare enlightenment, a creation: it will live because posterity cannot do without it.

I shall give an example. Liberal institutions cease to be liberal as soon as they are attained: later on, there are no worse and no more thorough injurers of freedom than liberal institutions. Their effects are known well enough: they undermine the will to power; they level mountain and valley, and call that morality; they make men small, cowardly, and hedonistic -- every time it is the herd animal that triumphs with them. Liberalism: in other words, herd-animalization.These same institutions produce quite different effects while they are still being fought for; then they really promote freedom in a powerful way. On closer inspection it is war that produces these effects, the war for liberal institutions, which, as a war, permits illiberal instincts to continue. And war educates for freedom. For what is freedom? That one has the will to assume responsibility for oneself. That one maintains the distance which separates us. That one becomes more indifferent to difficulties, hardships, privation, even to life itself. That one is prepared to sacrifice human beings for one\'s cause, not excluding oneself. Freedom means that the manly instincts which delight in war and victory dominate over other instincts, for example, over those of \\"pleasure.\\" The human being who has become free -- and how much more the spirit who has become free -- spits on the contemptible type of well-being dreamed of by shopkeepers, Christians, cows, females, Englishmen, and other democrats. The free man is a warrior. How is freedom measured in individuals and peoples? According to the resistance which must be overcome, according to the exertion required, to remain on top. The highest type of free men should be sought where the highest resistance is constantly overcome: five steps from tyranny, close to the threshold of the danger of servitude. This is true psychologically if by \\"tyrants\\" are meant inexorable and fearful instincts that provoke the maximum of authority and discipline against themselves; most beautiful type: Julius Caesar. This is true politically too; one need only go through history. The peoples who had some value, who attained some value, never attained it under liberal institutions: it was great danger that made something of them that merits respect. Danger alone acquaints us with our own resources, our virtues, our armor and weapons, our spirit, and forces us to be strong. First principle: one must need to be strong -- otherwise one will never become strong. Those large hothouses for the strong -- for the strongest kind of human being that has so far been known -- the aristocratic commonwealths of the type of Rome or Venice, understood freedom exactly in the sense in which I understand it: as something one has and does not have, something one wants, something one conquers","It is a pity that there was no Dostoevsky living near this most interesting decadent [Jesus], I mean someone with an eye for the distinctive charm that this sort of mixture of sublimity, sickness, and childishness has to offer.","Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy, where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority-- where he may forget \\"men who are the rule,\\" as their exception;-- exclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense.","It is a new step towards independence, once a man dares to express opinions that bring disgrace on him if he entertains them; then even his friends and acquaintances begin to grow anxious.

Even his \'beautiful indignation\' does him good; all poor devils like to whine--it gives them a little thrill of power. Even complaints, the act of complaining, can give life the charm on account of which one can stand to live it: there is a subtle dose of revenge in every complaint; one blames those who are different for one\'s own feeling bad, and in certain circumstances even being bad, as if they were guilty of an injustice, a prohibited privilege. \'If I\'m a lowlife, you should be one too\': on this logic, revolutions are built.\u2013Complaining is never good for anything; it comes from weakness. Whether one ascribes one\'s feeling bad to others or to oneself\u2013the socialist does the former, the Christian, for example, the latter\u2013makes no real difference. What is common to both and, let us add, what is unworthy, is that it should be someone\'s fault that one is suffering\u2013in short, that the sufferer prescribes the honey of revenge as a cure for his own suffering.","Women can form a friendship with a man very well; but to preserve it, a slight physical antipathy most probably helps.","Not without deep pain do we admit to ourselves that the artists of all ages have in their highest flights carried to heavenly transfiguration precisely those conceptions that we now recognize as false: they are the glorifiers of the religious and philosophical errors of humanity, and they could not have done this without their belief in the absolute truth of these errors. Now if the belief in such truth generally diminishes, if the rainbow colors at the outermost ends of human knowing and imagining fade: then the species of art that, like the Divina commedia, Raphael\'s pictures, Michelangelo\'s frescoes, the Gothic cathedrals, presupposes not only a cosmic, but also a metaphysical significance for art objects can never blossom again. A touching tale will come of this, that there was once such an art, such belief by artists.","There is a false saying, \u2018Whoever cannot save himself - how can he save others?\u2019 But if I have the key to your chains, why should your and my lock be the same.","In the end one experiences only oneself.","\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0631 \u062a\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0641\u0645: \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0649 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0647 \u0649 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0649 \u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u062f \u0634\u062f\u060c \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0647 \u0649 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0649 \u0643\u0647 \u0632\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0634 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0646\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0647\u060c \u0698\u0631\u0641 \u062a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0648\u062c\u062f\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0649 \u0643\u0647 \u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0634\u062f \u062a\u0627 \u0628\u0631 \u0647\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u0686\u0647 \u062a\u0627\u0643\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0631\u0622\u0645\u062f\u0647\u060c \u0645\u0637\u0644\u0648\u0628 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647\u060c \u0648 \u062a\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0633 \u06af\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0634\u0648\u0631\u062f.\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u064a\u0633\u062a\u0645\u060c \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0645\u064a\u062a\u0645!","The perfect woman indulges in literature just as she indulges in a small sin: as an experiment, in passing, looking around to see if anybody notices it \u2014 and to make sure that somebody does.","\u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0633\u0631\u062f\u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u06cc\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0631\u062f \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0628\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u062f\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u0648\u063a \u0645\u06cc \u06af\u0648\u06cc\u062f\u060c \u0648 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0648\u063a \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u062e\u0632\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \xab\u0645\u0646\u0650 \u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a\u060c \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u062a\u0645.\xbb","When the oppressed, downtrodden, outraged exhort one another with the vengeful cunning of impotence: \\"let us be different from the evil, namely good!

The hypocrite who always plays one and the same role finally ceases to be a hypocrite; for example priests, who as young men are usually conscious or unconscious hypocrites, finally become natural and then really are priests without any affectation; or if the father fails to get that far then perhaps the son does so, employing his father\'s start and inheriting his habits. If someone obstinately and for a long time wants to appear something it is int he end hard for him to be anything else. The profession of almost every man, even that of the artist, begins with hypocrisy, with an imitation from without, with a copying of what is most effective. He who is always wearing a mask of a friendly countenance must finally acquire a power over benevolent moods without which the impression of friendliness cannot be obtained - and finally these acquire power over him, he is benevolent.","Writers whose thoughts are expressed with clarity and precision are assumed by readers to be superficial.

Better than your words, your eye tells me all your peril.You are not yet free, you still search for freedom. Your search has fatigued you and made you too wakeful.You long for the open heights, your soul thirsts for the stars. But your bad instincts too thirst for freedom.Your fierce dogs long for freedom; they bark for joy in their cellar when your spirit aspires to break open all prisons.To me you are still a prisoner who imagines freedom: ah, such prisoners of the soul become clever, but also deceitful and base.The free man of the spirit, too, must still purify himself. Much of the prison and rottenness still remain within him: his eye still has to become pure.Yes, I know your peril.

For it uses up an extraordinary amount of nervous energy, which is thus denied to reflection, brooding, dreaming, worrying, loving, hating; it sets a small goal always in sight and guarantees easy and regular satisfactions. Thus a society in which there is continual hard work will have more security: and security is now worshipped as the supreme divinity. - And now! Horror! Precisely the \'worker\' has become dangerous!

To see the ultimate beauties in a work-all knowledge and good-will is not enough; it requires the rarest, good chance for the veil of clouds to move for once from the summits, and for the sun to shine on them. We must not only stand at precisely the right place to see this, our very soul itself must have pulled away the veil from its heights, and must be in need of an external expression and simile, so as to have a hold and remain master of itself. All these, however, are so rarely united at the same time that I am inclined to believe that the highest summit of all that is good, be it work, deed, man, or nature, has hitherto remained for most people, and even for the best, as something concealed and shrouded-that, however, which unveils itself to us, unveils itself to us but once. The Greeks indeed prayed: \\"Twice and thrice, everything beautiful!\\" Ah, they had their good reason to call on the Gods, for ungodly actuality does not furnish us with the beautiful at all, or only does so once! I mean to say that the world is overfull of beautiful things, but it is nevertheless poor, very poor, in beautiful moments, and in the unveiling of those beautiful things.

One has only to make a hundred or so sketches for novels, none longer than two pages but of such distinctness that every word in them is necessary; one should write down anecdotes each day until one has learned how to give them the most pregnant and effective form; one should be tireless in collecting and describing human types and characters; one should above all relate things to others and listen to others relate, keeping one\'s eyes and ears open for the effect produced on those present, one should travel like a landscape painter or costume designer; one should excerpt for oneself out of the individual sciences everything that will produce an artistic effect when it is well described, one should, finally, reflect on the motives of human actions, disdain no signpost to instruction about them and be a collector of these things by day and night.

This is the expression of the diseased condition in man, in contrast to the animals in which all existing instincts answer to quite definite tasks. This contradictory creature has in his nature, however, a great method of acquiring knowledge: he feels many pros and cons, he raises himself to justice---to comprehension beyond esteeming things good and evil.

The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really is this \\"Will to Truth\\" in us? In fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of this Will\u2014until at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth presented itself before us\u2014or was it we who presented ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.","Whoever extolls him as a God of love, does not think highly enough of love itself.","Twofold misjudgement. - The misfortune suffered by clear-minded and easily understood writers is that they are taken for shallow and thus little effort is expended on reading them: and the good fortune that attends the obscure is that the reader toils at them and ascribes to them the pleasure he has in fact gained from his own zeal.","Psychology has falsified love as surrender and altruism, while it is an appropriation or a bestowal following from a super-abundance of personality.

The series of \\"causes\\" stands before us much more complete in every case we conclude that this and that must first precede in order that that other may follow - but we have not grasped anything thereby. The peculiarity for example in every chemical process seems a \\"miracle \\" the same as before just like all locomotion nobody has \\"explained\\" impulse. How could we ever explain We operate only with things which do not exist with lines surfaces bodies atoms divisible times divisible spaces - how can explanation ever be possible when we first make everything a conception our conception It is sufficient to regard science as the exactest humanizing of things that is possible we always learn to describe ourselves more accurately by describing things and their successions. Cause and effect: there is probably never any such duality in fact there is a continuum before us from which we isolate a few portions - just as we always observe a motion as isolated points and therefore do not properly see it but infer it. The abruptness with which many effects take place leads us into error it is however only an abruptness for us. There is an infinite multitude of processes in that abrupt moment which escape us. An intellect which could see cause and effect as a continuum which could see the flux of events not according to our mode of perception as things arbitrarily separated and broken - would throw aside the conception of cause and effect and would deny all conditionality.","A time came when one rubbed one\'s eyes; one is still rubbing them today.","What has shaken me is not that you lied to me, but that I no longer believe you.","\u0627\u0644\u0630\u0649 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0637\u064a\u0639","I have done that\', says my memory.

It is not easy to get people to attend to it, and it requires them to consider it at length, to guard it, and to sleep on it. I consider bad conscience the profound illness which human beings had to come down with, under the pressure of the most fundamental of all the changes which they experienced\u2014that change when they finally found themselves locked within the confines of society and peace. Just like the things water animals must have gone though when they were forced either to become land animals or to die off, so events must have played themselves out with this half-beast so happily adapted to the wilderness, war, wandering around, adventure\u2014suddenly all its instincts were devalued and \u201cdisengaged.\u201dFrom this point on, these animals were to go on foot and \u201ccarry themselves\u201d; whereas previously they had been supported by the water.

At the age of 24 he became Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Basel, but resigned in 1879 due to health problems, which would plague him for most of his life. In 1889 he exhibited symptoms of a serious mental illness, living out his remaining years in the care of his mother and sister until his death in 1900.","In a dream\u2013in the last dream of the morning, I stood in the foothills today\u2013beyond the world, held scales, and weighed the world.","Where are we headed?

And so a cloud of melancholy gathers around their brow, for such natures hate the necessity of appearances more than death, and their persistent bitterness about this makes them volatile and menacing. From time to time they take revenge for their violent selfconcealment, for their coerced constraint. They emerge from their caves with horrible expressions on their faces; at such times their words and deeds are explosions, and it is even possible for them to destroy themselves.","I want, once and for all,not to know many things.Wisdom requires moderation in knowledgeas in other things.","Life itself appears to me as an instinct for growth, for survival, for the accumulation of forces, for power: whenever the will to power fails there is disaster.

That love may be able to bridge over the contrasts by joys, we must not remove or deny those contrasts.","Error regarding life necessary to life. - Every belief in the value and dignity of life rests on false thinking; it is possible only through the fact that empathy with the universal life and suffering of mankind is very feebly developed in the individual. Even those rarer men who think beyond themselves at all have an eye, not for this universal life, but for fenced-off portions of it. If one knows how to keep the exceptions principally in view, I mean the greatly gifted and pure of soul, takes their production for the goal of world-evolution and rejoices in the effects they in turn produce, one may believe in the value of life, because the one is overlooking all other men: thinking falsely, that is to say. And likewise if, though one does keep in view all mankind, one accords validity only to one species of drives, the less egoistical, and justifies them in face of all the others, then again one can hope for something of mankind as a whole and to this extent believe in the value of life: thus, in this case too, through falsity of thinking. Whichever of these attitudes one adopts, however, one is by adopting in an exception among men. The great majority endure life without complaining overmuch; they believe in the value of existence, but they do so precisely because each of them exists for himself alone, refusing to step out of himself as those exceptions do: everything outside themselves they notice not at all or at most as a dim shadow. Thus for the ordinary, everyday man the value of life rests solely on the fact that regards himself more highly than he does the world. The great lack of imagination from which he suffers means he is unable to feel his way into other beings and thus he participates as little as possible in their fortunes and sufferings. He, on the other hand, who really could participate in them would have to despair of the value of life; if he succeeded in encompassing and feeling within himself the total consciousness of mankind he would collapse with a curse on existence - for mankind has as a whole no goal, and the individual man when he regards its total course cannot derive from it any support or comfort, but must be reduced to despair. If in all he does he has before him the ultimate goallessness of man, his actions acquire in his own eyes the character of useless squandering. But to feel thus squandered, not merely as an individual fruits but as humanity as a whole, in the way we behold the individual fruits of nature squandered, is a feeling beyond all other feelings. - But who is capable of such a feeling? Certainly only a poet: and poets always know how to console themselves.","You run ahead? Are you doing it as a shepherd? Or as an exception? A third case would be as a fugitive.

What is normal is crossed races, in which, together with a disharmony of physical features (when eye and mouth do not correspond with one another, for example), there must always go a disharmony of habits and value-concepts. (Livingstone\xb9\xb9\xb3 heard someone say: \'God created white and black men but the Devil Created the half-breeds.\') Crossed races always mean at the same time crossed cultures, crossed moralities: they are usually more evil, crueller, more restless. Purity is the final result of countless adaptations, absorptions and secretions, and progress towards purity is evidenced in the fact that the energy available to a race is increasingly restricted to individual selected functions, while previously it was applied to too many and often contradictory things: such a restriction will always seem to be an impoverishment and should be assessed with consideration and caution. In the end, however, if the process of purification is successful, all that energy formerly expended in the struggle of the dissonant qualities with one another will stand at the command of the total organism: which is why races that have become pure have always also become stronger and more beautiful. The Greeks offer us the model of a race and culture that has become pure: and hopefully we shall one day also achieve a pure European race and culture.","As long as a man knows very well the strength and weaknesses of his teaching, his art, his religion, its power is still slight.

This is not contradicted by the fact that men actually get so much farther with their intelligence: they have the deeper, more powerful drives; these take their intelligence, which is in itself something passive, forward. Women are often privately amazed at the great honor men pay to their hearts. When men look especially for a profound, warm-hearted being, in choosing their spouse, and women for a clever, alert, and brilliant being, one sees very clearly how a man is looking for an idealized man, and a woman for an idealized woman--that is, not for a complement, but for the perfection of their own merits.","\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u0637\u0644\u062a\u064e \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u062f\u064a\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0641\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u064f\u062d\u064e\u062f\u0651\u0650\u0642 \u0641\u064a\u0643.","For the male sickness of self-contempt, the surest cure is to be loved by a clever woman","This is precisely why the Jews are the most disastrous people in world history: they have left such a falsified humanity in their wake that even today Christians can think of themselves as anti-Jewish without understanding that they are the ultimate conclusion of Judaism.","Die Forderung, geliebt zu werden, ist die gr\xf6\xdfte der Anma\xdfungen.","For us, the falsity of a judgment is still no objection to that judgment \u2014 that\u2019s where our new way of speaking sounds perhaps most strange.

I do not want to believe it although it is palpable: the great majority of people lacks an intellectual conscience. Indeed, it has often seemed to me as if anyone calling for an intellectual conscience were as lonely in the most densely populated cities as if he were in a desert. Everybody looks at you with strange eyes and goes right on handling his scales, calling this good and that evil. Nobody even blushes when you intimate that their weights are underweight; nor do people feel outraged; they merely laugh at your doubts. I mean: the great majority of people does not consider it contemptible to believe this or that and to live accordingly, without first having given themselves an account of the final and most certain reasons pro and con, and without even troubling themselves about such reasons afterward: the most gifted men and the noblest women still belong to this \\"great majority.\\" But what is goodheartedness, refinement, or genius to me, when the person who has these virtues tolerates slack feelings in his faith and judgments and when he does not account the desire for certainty as his inmost craving and deepest distress\u2014as that which separates the higher human beings from the lower.Among some pious people I found a hatred of reason and was well disposed to them for that; for this at least betrayed their bad intellectual conscience. But to stand in the midst of this rerum concordia discors and of this whole marvelous uncertainty and rich ambiguity of existence without questioning, without trembling with the craving and the rapture of such questioning, without at least hating the person who questions, perhaps even finding him faintly amusing\u2014that is what I feel to be contemptible, and this is the feeling for which I look first in everybody. Some folly keeps persuading me that every human being has this feeling, simply because he is human.

If you want to make them feel good at such moments, you have to make them laugh or voice some cold but witty sarcasm; then their feeling freezes and they regain power over themselves. But I am giving you the moral before telling the story. There was a time in our lives when we were so close that nothing seemed to obstruct our friendship and brotherhood, and only a small footbridge separated us. Just as you were about to step on it, I asked you: \u201cDo you want to cross the footbridge to me? \u2014Immediately, you did not want to any more; and when I asked you again, you remained silent.

Sophocles said of Aeschylus that he did what was right, though he did it unconsciously. This was surely not how Euripides saw it. He might have said that Aeschylus, because he created unconsciously, did what was wrong.

of types, the abundance of a lavish play and change of forms \u2014 and some wretched loafer of a moralist comments: \\"No! Man ought to be different.\\" He even knows what man should be like, this wretched bigot and prig: he paints himself on the wall and comments, \\"Ecce homo!\\" But even when the moralist addresses himself only to the single human being and says to him, \\"You ought to be such and such!\\" he does not cease to make himself ridiculous. The single human being is a piece of fatum from the front and from the rear, one law more, one necessity more for all that is yet to come and to be. To say to him, \\"Change yourself!\\" is to demand that everything be changed, even retroactively. And indeed there have been consistent moralists who wanted man to be different, that is, virtuous \u2014 they wanted him remade in their own image, as a prig: to that end, they negated the world!

That tragedy should begin with him, that the Dionysiac wisdom of tragedy should speak through him, is as puzzling a phenomenon as, more generally, the origin of tragedy from the chorus. Perhaps we can gain a starting point for this inquiry by claiming that the satyr, that fictive nature sprite, stands to cultured man in the same relation as Dionysian music does to civilization. Richard Wagner has said of the latter that it is absorbed by music as lamplight by daylight. In the same manner, I believe, the cultured Greek felt himself absorbed into the satyr chorus, and in the next development of Greek tragedy state and society, in fact everything that separates man from man, gave way before an overwhelming sense of unity that led back into the heart of nature. This metaphysical solace (which, I wish to say at once, all true tragedy sends us away) that, despite every phenomenal change, life is at bottom indestructibly joyful and powerful, was expressed most concretely in the chorus of satyrs, nature beings who dwell behind all civilization and preserve their identity through every change of generations and historical movement.With this chorus the profound Greek, so uniquely susceptible to the subtlest and deepest suffering, who had penetrated the destructive agencies of both nature and history, solaced himself. Though he had been in danger of craving a Buddhistic denial of the will, he was saved through art, and through art life reclaimed him.","On this perfect day, when everything is ripening and not only the grape turns brown, the eye of the sun just fell upon my life: I looked back, I looked forward, and never saw so many and such good things at once.

While he is contemplative-perceptive like the artist, compassionate like the religious, a seeker of purposes and causalities like the scientist, even while he feels himself swelling into a macrocosm, he all the while retains a certain self-possession, a way of viewing himself coldly as a mirror of the world. This is the same sense of self-possession which characterizes the dramatic artist who transforms himself into alien bodies and talks with their alien tongues and yet can project this transformation into written verse that exists in the outsitle world on its own. \\"Vhat verse is for the poet, dialectical thinking is for the philosopher.Friedrich Nietzsche, Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks, Regnery Publishing, 1998, 117.

Never to observe in order to observe! That gives a false perspective, leads to squinting and something forced and exaggerated. Experience as the wish to experience does not succeed. One must not eye oneself while having an experience; else the eye becomes \\"an evil eye.\\" A born psychologist guards instinctively against seeing in order to see; the same is true of the born painter. He never works \\"from nature\\"; he leaves it to his instinct, to his camera obscura, to sift through and express the \\"case,\\" \\"nature,\\" that which is \\"experienced.\\" He is conscious only of what is general, of the conclusion, the result: he does not know arbitrary abstractions from an individual case.What happens when one proceeds differently? For example, if, in the manner of the Parisian novelists, one goes in for backstairs psychology and deals in gossip, wholesale and retail? Then one lies in wait for reality, as it were, and every evening one brings home a handful of curiosities. But note what finally comes of all this: a heap of splotches, a mosaic at best, but in any case something added together, something restless, a mess of screaming colors. The worst in this respect is accomplished by the Goncourts; they do not put three sentences together without really hurting the eye, the psychologist\'s eye. Nature, estimated artistically, is no model. It exaggerates, it distorts, it leaves gaps. Nature is chance. To study \\"from nature\\" seems to me to be a bad sign: it betrays submission, weakness, fatalism; this lying in the dust before petit faits [little facts] is unworthy of a whole artist. To see what is--that is the mark of another kind of spirit, the anti-artistic, the factual. One must know who one is.Toward a psychology of the artist. -- If there is to be art, if there is to be any aesthetic doing and seeing, one physiological condition is indispensable: frenzy. Frenzy must first have enhanced the excitability of the whole machine; else there is no art. All kinds of frenzy, however diversely conditioned, have the strength to accomplish this: above all, the frenzy of sexual excitement, this most ancient and original form of frenzy. Also the frenzy that follows all great cravings, all strong affects; the frenzy of feasts, contests, feats of daring, victory, all extreme movement; the frenzy of cruelty; the frenzy in destruction, the frenzy under certain meteorological influences, as for example the frenzy of spring; or under the influence of narcotics; and finally the frenzy of will, the frenzy of an overcharged and swollen will. What is essential in such frenzy is the feeling of increased strength and fullness. Out of this feeling one lends to things, one forces them to accept from us, one violates them--this process is called idealizing. Let us get rid of a prejudice here: idealizing does not consist, as is commonly held, in subtracting or discounting the petty and inconsequential. What is decisive is rather a tremendous drive to bring out the main features so that the others disappear in the process.In this state one enriches everything out of one\'s own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever one wills, is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power--until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is--art. Even everything that he is not yet, becomes for him an occasion of joy in himself; in art man enjoys himself as perfection.","What makes heroic? \u2013 To go to meet simultaneously one\u2019s greatest sorrow and one\u2019s greatest hope.","\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0645\u064a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u0622\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0631\u0627 \u0643\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u064a \u0641\u0631\u0648 \u0634\u062f\u0646 \u0648 \u0641\u0631\u0627 \u0634\u062f\u0646 \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a \u0641\u0631\u0627\u067e\u0634\u062a \u0633\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u064a \u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0646\u0645\u064a\u06af\u0631\u062f\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0628\u0644 \u062e\u0648\u064a\u0634 \u0631\u0627 \u0641\u062f\u0627\u064a \u0632\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u064a\u0643\u0646\u0646\u062f \u062a\u0627 \u0632\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0632\u064a \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0648\u062f","Only those thoughts which come from walking have any value","I mistrust all Systematisers and I avoid them \u2014 the will to a System is a lack of integrity.","When a man feels that he has a divine mission, say to lift up, to save or to liberate mankind - when a man feels the divine spark in his heart and believes that he is the mouthpiece of supernatural imperatives - when such a mission inflames him, it is only natural that he should stand beyond all merely reasonable standards of judgment.

The fact that a man is publicly useful, that he is a wheel, a function, is evidence of a natural predisposition; it is not society, but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable of, that makes them intelligent machines.

But displeasure after the deed need not be rational at all: in fact, it certainly is not rational, for it rests on the erroneous assumption that the deed did not have to follow necessarily. Thus, because he thinks he is free (but not because he is free), man feels remorse and the pangs of conscience.Furthermore, this displeasure is a habit that can be given up; many men do not feel it at all, even after the same actions that cause many other men to feel it. Tied to the development of custom and culture, it is a very changeable thing, and present perhaps only within a relatively short period of world history.No one is responsible for his deeds, no one for his nature; to judge is to be unjust. This is also true when the individual judges himself. The tenet is as bright as sunlight, and yet everyone prefers to walk back into the shadow and untruth - for fear of the consequences.","At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I propose that egoism belongs to the nature of a noble soul, I mean that unshakable faith that to a being such as \'we are\' other beings must be subordinate by nature and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts this fact of its egoism without any question mark, without a feeling that it might contain hardness, constraint, or caprice, but rather as something that may be founded in the primordial law of things: if it sought a name for this fact it would say \u2018it is justice itself.\u2019 Perhaps it admits under certain circumstances, which, at first, make it hesitate, that there are some who have rights equal to its own; as soon as this matter of rank is settled, it moves among these equals, with their equal privileges, showing the same sureness of modesty and delicate reverence that characterize its relations with itself \u2013 in accordance with an innate heavenly mechanism, understood by all stars. It is merely another aspect of its egoism, this refinement and self-limitation in its relations with its equals \u2013 every star is such an egoist \u2013 it honors itself in them, and in the rights it cedes to them; it does not doubt that the exchange of honors and rights is of the nature of all social relations, and thus also belongs to the natural condition of things.The noble soul gives as it takes from that passionate and irritable instinct of repayment that lies in its depth. The concept of grace has no meaning or good odor inter pares; there may be a sublime way to let presents from above happen to one, as it were, and to drink them up thirstily, like drops, but for this art and gesture the noble soul has no aptitude. Its egoism hinders it: quite generally it does not like to look \'up,\' but either ahead , horizontally and slowly, or down: it knows itself to be at a height.","p5 - It is matter for wonder: the moment that is here and gone, that was nothing before and nothing after, returns like a specter to trouble the quiet of a later moment...the beast(animals)...forgets at once and sees every moment really die, sink into night and mist, extinguished forever.

Under an invisible spell, they always revolve once more in the same orbit; however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something within them leads them, something impels them in a definite order, one after the other - to wit, the innate systematic structure and relationship of their concepts. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a recognition, a remembering, a return and a homecoming to a remote, primordial, and inclusive household of the soul, out of which those concepts grew originally: philosophizing is to this extent a kind of atavism of the highest order.","\u0631\u064e\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u06cc\u0646 \u067e\u0644\u06cc \u0633\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0646 \u0648 \u0631\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u0633 \u0637\u0648\u0641\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u0627\u0632.--\u0646\u06cc\u0686\u0647\u060c \u0686\u0646\u06cc\u0646 \u06af\u0641\u062a \u0632\u0631\u062a\u0634\u062a\u060c \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06cc \u0631\u062a\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u0646","Sometimes just a stronger pair of glasses will cure an amorous man.","You have made danger your vocation; there is nothing contemptible in that.

These valuations and orders of rank are always the expression of the needs of a community or herd: that which is in the first place to its advantage- and in the second place and third place-is also the authoritative standard for the worth of every individual. By morality the individual is taught to become a function of the herd, and to ascribe to himself value only as a function. As the conditions for the maintenance of one community have been very different from those of another community, there have been very different moralities; and in respect to the future essential transformations of herds and communities, states and societies, one can prophesy that there will still be very divergent moralities. Morality is the herd-instinct in the individual.","What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal","The free intellect copies human life, but it considers this life to be something good and seems to be quite satisfied with it. That immense framework and planking of concepts to which the needy man clings his whole life long in order to preserve himself is nothing but a scaffolding and toy for the most audacious feats of the liberated intellect. And when it smashes this framework to pieces, throws it into confusion, and puts it back together in an ironic fashion, pairing the most alien things and separating the closest, it is demonstrating that it has no need of these makeshifts of indigence and that it will now be guided by intuitions rather than by concepts.","I am no man, I am dynamite","The peculiar, withdrawn attitude of the philosopher, world denying, hostile to life, suspicious of the senses, freed from sensuality, which has been maintained down to the most modern times and has become virtually the philosopher\u2019s pose par excellence\u2014is above all a result of the emergency conditions under which philosophy arose and survived at all; for the longest time, philosophy would not have been possible at all on earth without ascetic wraps and cloaks, without an ascetic self-misunderstanding.

Were it not so, pain would long ago have been done away with ; that it is hurtful is no argument against it, for to be hurtful is its very essence. In pain I hear the commanding call of the ship\'s captain : \\" Take in sail!\\" \\" Man,\\" the bold seafarer, must have learned to set his sails in a thousand different ways, otherwise he could not have sailed long, for the ocean would soon have swallowed him up. We must also know how to live with reduced energy : as soon as pain gives its precautionary signal, it is time to reduce the speed-some great danger, some storm, is approaching, and we do well to \\"catch\\" as little wind as possible.-It is true that there are men who, on the approach of severe pain, hear the very opposite call of command, and never appear more proud, more martial, or more happy than when the storm is brewing; indeed, pain itself provides them with their supreme moments! These are the heroic men, the great pain-bringers of mankind: those few and rare ones who need just the same apology as pain generally,-and verily, it should not be denied them! They are forces of the greatest importance for preserving and advancing the species, be it only because they are opposed to smug ease, and do not conceal their disgust at this kind of happiness.","A light has dawned for me: I need companions, living ones, not dead companions and corpses which I carry with me wherever I wish.

Anyone who has not experienced life on a greater and higher level than everyone else will not know how to interpret the greatness and loftiness of the past. The utterance of the past is always an oracular pronouncement. You will understand it only as builders of the future and as people who know about the present. People now explain the extraordinarily deep and far-reaching effect of Delphi by the particular fact that the Delphic priests had precise knowledge about the past. It is appropriate now to understand that only the man who builds the future has a right to judge the past. In order to look ahead, set yourselves an important goal, and at the same time control that voluptuous analytical drive with which you now lay waste the present and render almost impossible all tranquility, all peaceful growth and maturing. Draw around yourself the fence of a large and extensive hope, an optimistic striving. Create in yourselves a picture to which the future is to correspond, and forget the myth that you are epigones. You have enough to plan and to invent when you imagine that future life for yourselves. But in considering history do not ask that she show you the \'How?\' and the \'With what?\' If, however, you live your life in the history of great men, then you will learn from history the highest command: to become mature and to flee away from that paralyzing and prohibiting upbringing of the age, which sees advantages for itself in not allowing you to become mature, in order to rule and exploit you, the immature. And when you ask after biographies, then do not ask for those with the refrain \'Mr. Soandso and His Age\' but for those whose title page must read \'A Fighter Against His Age.\' Fill your souls with Plutarch, and dare to believe in yourselves when you have faith in his heroes.

Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature, you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be Nature \\"according to the Stoa,\\" and would like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal glorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature falsely, that is to say, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwise\u2014and to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that because you are able to tyrannize over yourselves\u2014Stoicism is self-tyranny\u2014Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to \\"creation of the world,\\" the will to the causa prima. 10.","But one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, and another thing is the idea of the deed.

Here good, sound customs are strengthened, here the subordination of the individual is learned and character is already given steadiness as a gift at birth and has it afterward reinforced by upbringing. The danger for these strong communities based upon individuals who all share a similar character is a gradual increase in inherited stupidity, which trails all stability like its shadow. It is the more unconstrained, the much more uncertain and morally weaker individuals upon whom spiritual progress depends in such communities: these are the people who attempt new things and, in general, many different things. Because of their weakness, countless individuals of this kind perish without much visible effect; but in general, especially when they have descendants, they loosen things up and inflict from time to time a wound upon the stable element of a community. Precisely in this wounded and weakened spot, the collective being is inoculated, as it were, with something new; but its strength as a whole must be great enough to absorb this new thing into its blood and to assimilate it.

God\u2019s pity for the only form of distress that invades all paradises knows no bounds: so he forthwith creates other animals. God\u2019s first mistake: to man these other animals were not entertaining\u2014he sought dominion over them; he did not want to be an \u201canimal\u201d himself.\u2014So God created woman.

Ergo, she is also to blame for science.... It was through woman that man learned to taste of the tree of knowledge.\u2014What happened? The old God was seized by mortal terror. Man himself had been his greatest blunder; he had created a rival to himself; science makes men godlike\u2014it is all up with priests and gods when man becomes scientific!\u2014Moral: science is the forbidden per se; it alone is forbidden.

Happiness, leisure, foster thought\u2014and all thoughts are bad thoughts!\u2014Man must not think.\u2014And so the priest invents distress, death, the mortal dangers of childbirth, all sorts of misery, old age, decrepitude, above all, sickness\u2014nothing but devices for making war on science!

Thus, people say that we have the content and that only the form is lacking. But with respect to everything alive this is a totally improper contradiction. For our modern culture is not alive, simply because it does let itself be understood without that contradiction; that is, it is really no true culture, but only a way of knowing about culture. There remain in it thoughts of culture, feelings of culture, but no cultural imperatives come from it. In contrast to this, what really motivates and moves outward into action then often amounts to not much more than a trivial convention, a pathetic imitation, or even a raw grimace. At that point the inner feeling is probably asleep, like the snake which has swallowed an entire rabbit and then lies down contentedly still in the sunlight and avoids all movements other than the most essential.","Among the things that can drive a thinker to despair is the knowledge that the illogical is necessary for man and that much good comes from it.

Only the very naive are capable of thinking that the nature of man can be transformed into a purely logical one; but, if there were degrees of approximation to this goal, how much would not have to vanish along this path!

The ruin and degeneration of the solitary species is much greater and more terrible: they have the instincts of the herd, and the tradition of values, against them; their weapons of defence, their instincts of self-preservation, are from the beginning insufficiently strong and reliable \u2014 fortune must be peculiarly favourable to them if they are to prosper (they prosper best in the lowest ranks and dregs of society; if ye are seeking personalities it is there that ye will find them with much greater certainty than in the middle classes!)When the dispute between ranks and classes, which aims at equality of rights, is almost settled, the fight will begin against the solitary person.

There is no more poisonous poison anywhere: for it seems to be preached by justice itself, whereas it really is the termination of justice. \\"Equal to the equal, unequal to the unequal\\" \u2014 that would be the true slogan of justice; and also its corollary: \\"Never make equal what is unequal.\\" That this doctrine of equality was surrounded by such gruesome and bloody events, that has given this \\"modern idea\\" par excellence a kind of glory and fiery aura so that the Revolution as a spectacle has seduced even the noblest spirits. In the end, that is no reason for respecting it any more. I see only one man who experienced it as it must be experienced, with nausea \u2014 Goethe.Goethe \u2014 not a German event, but a European one: a magnificent attempt to overcome the eighteenth century by a return to nature, by an ascent to the naturalness of the Renaissance \u2014 a kind of self-overcoming on the part of that century. He bore its strongest instincts within himself: the sensibility, the idolatry of nature, the anti-historic, the idealistic, the unreal and revolutionary (the latter being merely a form of the unreal). He sought help from history, natural science, antiquity, and also Spinoza, but, above all, from practical activity; he surrounded himself with limited horizons; he did not retire from life but put himself into the midst of it; he if was not fainthearted but took as much as possible upon himself, over himself, into himself. What he wanted was totality; he fought the mutual extraneousness of reason, senses, feeling, and will (preached with the most abhorrent scholasticism by Kant, the antipode of Goethe); he disciplined himself to wholeness, he created himself.In the middle of an age with an unreal outlook, Goethe was a convinced realist: he said Yes to everything that was related to him in this respect \u2014 and he had no greater experience than that ens realissimum [most real being] called Napoleon.Goethe conceived a human being who would be strong, highly educated, skillful in all bodily matters, self-controlled, reverent toward himself, and who might dare to afford the whole range and wealth of being natural, being strong enough for such freedom; the man of tolerance, not from weakness but from strength, because he knows how to use to his advantage even that from which the average nature would perish; the man for whom there is no longer anything that is forbidden \u2014 unless it be weakness, whether called vice or virtue.Such a spirit who has become free stands amid the cosmos with a joyous and trusting fatalism, in the faith that only the particular is loathesome, and that all is redeemed and affirmed in the whole \u2014 he does not negate anymore. Such a faith, however, is the highest of all possible faiths: I have baptized it with the name of Dionysus.50 One might say that in a certain sense the nineteenth century also strove for all that which Goethe as a person had striven for: universality in understanding and in welcoming, letting everything come close to oneself, an audacious realism, a reverence for everything factual.","If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to do so.But the wind, which we do not see, troubles and bends it as it lists.

There are days when I am visited by a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholy\u2014contempt of man. Let me leave no doubt as to what I despise, whom I despise: it is the man of today, the man with whom I am unhappily contemporaneous. The man of today\u2014I am suffocated by his foul breath!\u2026 Toward the past, like all who understand, I am full of tolerance, which is to say, generous self-control: with gloomy caution I pass through whole millenniums of this madhouse of a world, call it \u201cChristianity, \u201cChristian faith\u201d or the \u201cChristian church,\u201d as you will\u2014I take care not to hold mankind responsible for its lunacies. But my feeling changes and breaks out irresistibly the moment I enter modern times, our times. Our age knows better\u2026 . What was formerly merely sickly now becomes indecent\u2014it is indecent to be a Christian today. And here my disgust begins.\u2014I look about me: not a word survives of what was once called \u201ctruth\u201d; we can no longer bear to hear a priest pronounce the word. Even a man who makes the most modest pretensions to integrity must know that a theologian, a priest, a pope of today not only errs when he speaks, but actually lies\u2014and that he no longer escapes blame for his lie through \u201cinnocence\u201d or \u201cignorance.\u201d The priest knows, as every one knows, that there is no longer any \u201cGod,\u201d or any \u201csinner,\u201d or any \u201cSaviour\u201d\u2014that \u201cfree will\u201d and the \u201cmoral order of the world\u201d are lies\u2014: serious reflection, the profound self-conquest of the spirit, allow no man to pretend that he does not know it\u2026 . All the ideas of the church are now recognized for what they are\u2014as the worst counterfeits in existence, invented to debase nature and all natural values; the priest himself is seen as he actually is\u2014as the most dangerous form of parasite, as the venomous spider of creation\u2026 . We know, our conscience now knows\u2014just what the real value of all those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and what ends they have served, with their debasement of humanity to a state of self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing,\u2014the concepts \u201cthe other world,\u201d \u201cthe last judgment,\u201d \u201cthe immortality of the soul,\u201d the \u201csoul\u201d itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture, systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and remains master\u2026 . Every one knows this, but nevertheless things remain as before. What has become of the last trace of decent feeling, of self-respect, when our statesmen, otherwise an unconventional class of men and thoroughly anti-Christian in their acts, now call themselves Christians and go to the communion-table?\u2026 A prince at the head of his armies, magnificent as the expression of the egoism and arrogance of his people\u2014and yet acknowledging, without any shame, that he is a Christian!\u2026 Whom, then, does Christianity deny? what does it call \u201cthe world\u201d? To be a soldier, to be a judge, to be a patriot; to defend one\u2019s self; to be careful of one\u2019s honour; to desire one\u2019s own advantage; to be proud \u2026 every act of everyday, every instinct, every valuation that shows itself in a deed, is now anti-Christian: what a monster of falsehood the modern man must be to call himself nevertheless, and without shame, a Christian!\u2014\u201d","Your virtue is the health of your soul.","To be incapable of taking one\'s enemies, one\'s accidents, even one\'s misdeeds seriously for very long - that is the sign of strong, full natures in whom there is an excess of the power to form, to mold, to recuperate and to forget [...].

Because of the peculiar weakness of modern talent we are inclined to imagine the original aesthetic phenomenon in too complicated and abstract a manner. For the genuine poet metaphor is no rhetorical figure, but an image which takes the place of something else, something he can really see before him as a substitute for a concept. To the poet a character is not a whole composed of selected single features, but an insistently alive person whom he sees before his very eyes, and distinguished from a painter\'s vision of the same thing only by the fact that poet sees the figure continuing to live and act over a period of time. What allows Homer to depict things so much more vividly than all other poets? It is the fact that he looks at things so much more than they do. We talk so abstractly about poetry because we are usually all bad poets. Fundamentally the aesthetic phenomenon is simple; one only has to have the ability to watch a living play continuously and to live constantly surrounded by crowds of spirits, then one is a poet; if one feels the impulse to transform oneself and to speak out of other bodies and souls, then one is a dramatist","Whom do you call Bad?-Him who always wants to put others to shame.","For every impulse is imperious, and as SUCH, attempts to philosophize.

He feels that his beloved is fully in his possession only when she no longer deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much for his devilry and hidden insatiability as for his graciousness, patience, and spirituality.One type wants to possess a people\u2014and all the higher arts of a Cagliostro and Catiline suit him to that purpose. Someone else, with a more subtle thirst for possession, says to himself: \u201cOne may not deceive where one wants to possess.\u201d The idea that a mask of him might command the heart of the people irritates him and makes him impatient: \u201cSo I must let myself be known, and first must know myself.\u201d","cele 3 secolediferitele lor tipuri de sensibilitate se exprima cel mai bine astfel:aristocratismul: Descartes, domnia ratiunii, marturie despre suveranitatea vointei.feminismul: Rousseau, domnia sentimentului, marturie despre suveranitatea simturilor, minciuna.animalismul: Schopenhauer, domnia dorintei, marturie despre suveranitatea animalitatii. mai cinstit, dar sumbru.secolul 17 e aristocratic, ordonator, trufas fata de animalic, sever fata de inima, \\"incomod\\", chiar lipsit de sentiment, negermanic, retinut fata de burlesc si naturalete, inclinat spre generalizare si cu aere de suveranitate fata de trecut, deoarece este increzator in sine. in mare masura si animal de prada, multa deprindere ascetica pt a putea ramane stapan. secolul tariei de vointa dar si al pasiunii puternice.secolul 18 e dominat de femeie, visator, inteligent, cam plat, avand totusi un anumit spirit la dispozitia dorintelor sale, a inimii, libertin in delectarea cu cele spirituale, subminand orice gen de autoritate. ametit, voios, limpede, uman, fals fata de sine, o mare canalie au fond, sociabil.secolul 19 e mai animalic, mai subteran, mai urat, mai realist, mai badaran si tocmai de aceea considerat \\"mai bun\\" \\"mai cinstit\\" mai smerit in fata \\"realitatii\\", mai autentic. dar slab in vointa, dar trist si sumbru, pofticios dar fatalist. nu se teme si nici nu stimeaza ratiunea sau inima. adanc convins de dominatia poftelor [Schopenhauer vorbea de \\"vointa\\" dar nimic nu e mai caracteristic pt filozofia sa, decat ca ii lipseste tocmai vointa per se]. pana si morala e redusa la un singur instinct [\\"mila\\"].faptul ca stiinta devenit intr\'un asemenea grad suverana arata ca secolul 19 s\'a eliberat de dominatia idealurilor. abia o anumita lipsa de pretentii in felul nostru de a dori ne face posibila starea de curiozitate si rigoare stiintifica - aceasta stranie virtute care ne apartine. secolul 19 cauta instinctiv teorii cu ajutorul carora isi simte justificata subordonarea fatalista fata de real. suntem niste oameni care se autodesfiinteaza.","All that is rare for the rare.","Reason in language- oh what an old deceptive female she is!

In the case of mortals of a choice and lofty nature they will be those of duty: that reverence, which in youth is most typical, that timidity and tenderness in the presence of the traditionally honored and the worthy, that gratitude to the soil from which we sprung, for the hand that guided us, for the relic before which we were taught to pray\u2014their sublimest moments will themselves bind these souls most strongly.

At sunset in Genoa, I heard from a tower a long chiming of bells; it kept on and on, and over the noise of the backstreets, as if insatiable for itself, it rang out into the evening sky and the sea air, so terrible and so childish at the same time, so melancholy. then I thoughts of Platos\'s words and felt them suddenly in my heart: all in all, nothing human is worth taking very seriously; nevertheless ...","Dionysus versus \'Christ\'; here you have the contrast. It is not a difference in regard to the martyrdom, \u2014 but the latter has a different meaning. Life itself \u2014 Life\u2019s eternal fruitfulness and recurrence caused anguish, destruction, and the will to annihilation. In the other case, the suffering of the \'Christ as the Innocent One\' stands as an objection against Life, it is the formula of Life\u2019s condemnation. \u2014 Readers will guess that the problem concerns the meaning of suffering; whether a Christian or a tragic meaning is given to it. In the first case it is the road to a holy type of existence; in the second case existence itself is regarded as sufficiently holy to justify an enormous amount of suffering. The tragic man says yes even to the most excruciating suffering: he is sufficiently strong, rich, and capable of deifying, to be able to do this; the Christian denies even the happy lots on earth: he is weak, poor, and disinherited enough to suffer from life in any form. God on the Cross is a curse upon Life, a signpost directing people to deliver themselves from it; \u2014 Dionysus cut into pieces is a promise of Life: it will be forever born anew and rise afresh from destruction.","Ik houd van hem, die vrij van geest en vrij van hart is: aldus is zijn hoofd slechts het ingewand van zijn hart; zijn hart echter drijft hem tot ondergang.","But this nation has deliberately made itself stupid, for practically a thousand years: nowhere else are the two great European narcotics, alcohol and Christianity, so viciously abused.","Truly, you understand the reverse art of alchemy, the depreciating of the most valuable things! Try, just for once, another recipe, in order not to realise as hitherto the opposite of what you mean to attain: deny those good things, withdraw from them the applause of the populace and discourage the spread of them, make them once more the concealed chastities of solitary souls, and say: morality is something forbidden! Perhaps you will thus attract to your cause the sort of men who are only of any account, I mean the heroic. But then there must be something formidable in it, and not as hitherto something disgusting!","And even in woman\'s conscious love, there is still always surprise and lightning and night, along with the light.","I have gradually come to understand what every great philosophy until now has been: the confession of its author and a kind of involuntarily unconscious memoir.","I pass through this people and keep mine eyes open: they do not forgive me for do not envying their virtues.

He says, for example, \\"I am rich,\\" when the proper designation for his condition would be \\"poor.\\" He misuses fixed conventions by means of arbitrary substitutions or even reversals of names. If he does this in a selfish and moreover harmful manner, society will cease to trust him and will thereby exclude him. What men avoid by excluding the liar is not so much being defrauded as it is being harmed by means of fraud. Thus, even at this stage, what they hate is basically not deception itself, but rather the unpleasant, hated consequences of certain sorts of deception. It is in a similarly restricted sense that man now wants nothing but truth: he desires the pleasant, life-preserving consequences of truth. He is indifferent toward pure knowledge which has no consequences; toward those truths which are possibly harmful and destructive he is even hostilely inclined. And besides, what about these linguistic conventions themselves? Are they perhaps products of knowledge, that is, of the sense of truth? Are designations congruent with things? Is language the adequate expression of all realities? It is only by means of forgetfulness that man can ever reach the point of fancying himself to possess a \\"truth\\" of the grade just indicated. If he will not be satisfied with truth in the form of tautology, that is to say, if he will not be content with empty husks, then he will always exchange truths for illusions. What is a word? It is the copy in sound of a nerve stimulus. But the further inference from the nerve stimulus to a cause outside of us is already the result of a false and unjustifiable application of the principle of sufficient reason. If truth alone had been the deciding factor in the genesis of language, and if the standpoint of certainty had been decisive for designations, then how could we still dare to say \\"the stone is hard,\\" as if \\"hard\\" were something otherwise familiar to us, and not merely a totally subjective stimulation!

That task of breeding an animal which can make promises, includes, as we have already grasped, as its condition and preliminary, the more immediate task of first making man to a certain extent, necessitated, uniform, like among his like, regular, and consequently calculable. The immense work of what I have called, \\"morality of custom\\", the actual work of man on himself during the longest period of the human race, his whole prehistoric work, finds its meaning, its great justification (in spite of all its innate hardness, despotism, stupidity, and idiocy) in this fact: man, with the help of the morality of customs and of social strait-waistcoats, was made genuinely calculable. If, however, we place ourselves at the end of this colossal process, at the point where the tree finally matures its fruits, when society and its morality of custom finally bring to light that to which it was only the means, then do we find as the ripest fruit on its tree the sovereign individual, that resembles only himself, that has got loose from the morality of custom, the autonomous \\"super-moral\\" individual (for \\"autonomous\\" and \\"moral\\" are mutually-exclusive terms),\u2014in short, the man of the personal, long, and independent will, competent to promise, and we find in him a proud consciousness (vibrating in every fibre), of what has been at last achieved and become vivified in him, a genuine consciousness of power and freedom, a feeling of human perfection in general. And this man who has grown to freedom, who is really competent to promise, this lord of the free will, this sovereign\u2014how is it possible for him not to know how great is his superiority over everything incapable of binding itself by promises, or of being its own security, how great is the trust, the awe, the reverence that he awakes\u2014he \\"deserves\\" all three\u2014not to know that with this mastery over himself he is necessarily also given the mastery over circumstances, over nature, over all creatures with shorter wills, less reliable characters? The \\"free\\" man, the owner of a long unbreakable will, finds in this possession his standard of value: looking out from himself upon the others, he honours or he despises, and just as necessarily as he honours his peers, the strong and the reliable (those who can bind themselves by promises),\u2014that is, every one who promises like a sovereign, with difficulty, rarely and slowly, who is sparing with his trusts but confers honour by the very fact of trusting, who gives his word as something that can be relied on, because he knows himself strong enough to keep it even in the teeth of disasters, even in the \\"teeth of fate,\\"\u2014so with equal necessity will he have the heel of his foot ready for the lean and empty jackasses, who promise when they have no business to do so, and his rod of chastisement ready for the liar, who already breaks his word at the very minute when it is on his lips. The proud knowledge of the extraordinary privilege of responsibility, the consciousness of this rare freedom, of this power over himself and over fate, has sunk right down to his innermost depths, and has become an instinct, a dominating instinct\u2014what name will he give to it, to this dominating instinct, if he needs to have a word for it?

The refinement, good, and loftiness of a soul are put to a dangerous test when something goes past in front of it which is of the first rank, but which is not yet protected by the shudders of authority from prying clutches and crudities: something that goes its way unmarked, undiscovered, tempting, perhaps arbitrarily disguised and hidden, like a living touchstone. The man whose task and practice is to investigate souls will use precisely this art in a number of different forms in order to establish the ultimate value of a soul, the unalterable innate order of rank to which it belongs: he will put it to the test for its instinct of reverence. Diff\xe9rence engendre haine [difference engenders hatred]: the nastiness of some natures suddenly spurts out like dirty water when some sacred container, some precious object from a locked shrine, some book with marks of a great destiny is carried by. On the other hand, there is an involuntary falling silent, a hesitation in the eye, an end to all gestures, things which express that a soul feels close to something most worthy of reverence. The way in which reverence for the Bible in Europe has, on the whole, been maintained so far is perhaps the best piece of discipline and refinement of tradition for which Europe owes a debt of thanks to Christianity: such books of profundity and ultimate significance need for their protection an externally imposed tyranny of authority in order to last for those thousands of years which are necessary to exhaust them and sort out what they mean. Much has been achieved when in the great mass of people (the shallow ones and all sorts of people with diarrhoea) that feeling has finally been cultivated that they are not permitted to touch everything, that there are sacred experiences before which they have to pull off their shoes and which they must keep their dirty hands off - this is almost the highest intensification of their humanity. By contrast, perhaps nothing makes the so-called educated people, those who have faith in \\"modern ideas,\\" so nauseating as their lack of shame, the comfortable impudence in their eyes and hands, with which they touch, lick, and grope everything, and it is possible that these days among a people, one still finds in the common folk, particularly among the peasants, more relative nobility of taste and tactful reverence than among the newspaper-reading demi-monde of the spirit, among the educated.Friedrich Nietzsche - Beyond Good and Evil","Thucydides and, maybe, Machiavelli\u2019s prince are most closely related to me by their unconditional will to fabricate nothing and to see reason in reality\u2014not in \u201creason, and still less in \u201cmorality\u201d . . .\u201d","Yo le llamo Estado adonde se envenenan todos los buenos y malos; donde se pierden todos, los buenos y los malos; donde el suicidio lento de todos se llama \'la vida\'.","The highest values in the service of which man ought to live, more particularly when they oppressed and constrained him most\u2014these social values, owing to their tone-strengthening tendencies, were built over men\u2019s heads as though they were the will of God or \u201creality, or the actual world, or even a hope of a world to come.

That a well-turned out person pleases our senses, that he is carved from wood that is hard, delicate, and at the same time smells good. He has a taste only for what is good for him; his pleasure, his delight cease where the measure of what is good for him is transgressed. He guesses what remedies avail against what is harmful; he exploits bad accidents to his advantage; what does not kill him makes him stronger. Instinctively, he collects from everything he sees, hears, lives through, his sum: he is a principle of selection, he discards much. He is always in his own company, whether he associates with books, human beings, or landscapes: he honors by choosing, by admitting, by trusting. He reacts slowly to all kinds of stimuli, with that slowness which long caution and deliberate pride have bred in him: he examines the stimulus that approaches him, he is far from meeting it halfway. He believes neither in \'misfortune\' nor in \'guilt\': he comes to terms with himself, with others: he knows how to forget \u2014 he is strong enough; hence everything must turn out for his best.","Tout ce qui ne tue pas l\'homme le rend plus fort.","\u0646\u0627\u0628\u062e\u0634\u0648\u062f\u0646\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0686\u06cc\u0632 \u062f\u0631 \u062a\u0648 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0648 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0631\u0627\u0646\u062f","\xabCel care caut\u0103 u\u015for se pierde.

The","He was a hidden God, full of secrecy. Truly, he did not come by his son otherwise than by secret ways. At the door of his faith stands adultery. Whoever extols him as a God of love, does not think highly enough of love itself. Did not that God want also to be judge? But the loving one loves irrespective of reward and requital. When he was young, that God out of the Orient, then was he harsh and revengeful, and built himself a hell for the delight of his favourites. At last, however, he became old and soft and mellow and pitiful, more like a grandfather than a father, but most like a tottering old grandmother. [...] and one day he suffocated of his all-too-great pity.","If one had the smallest vestige of superstition in one, it would hardly be possible to set aside completely the idea that one is the mere incarnation, mouthpiece or medium of an almighty power.","All things that endure for a long time are little by little permeated by reason that their origin in unreason becomes improbable.","La filolog\xeda es un arte venerable, que pide, ante todo, a sus adeptos que se mantengan retirados, que se tomen tiempo y se vuelvan silenciosos y pausados, un arte de orfebrer\xeda, un oficio de or\xedfice de la palabra, un arte que requiere un trabajo sutil y delicado, y en que nada se consigue sin aplicarse con lentitud.

To sit in judgment morally ought to be opposed to our taste! Let us leave this nonsense and this bad taste to those who have nothing else to do, save to drag the past a little distance further through time, and who are never themselves the present ... We, however, would seek to become what we are ... making laws for ourselves and creating ourselves! And for this purpose we must become the best students and discoverers of all the laws and necessities in the world. [335]","Truly, a filthy stream man is.

And of real productive work there can be no thought so long as one is not freed, however slightly, from one\'s trammels and the pain or oppression arising from one\'s limited outlook. Shall I ever attain to inner freedom? It is very doubtful. The goal is too remote, and even if one gets within measurable distance of it, one has by that time consumed all one\'s strength in long search and struggle. When freedom is at last attained, one is as lifeless and feeble as a day-fly by night. That is what I dread so much. It is a misfortune to be so conscious of one\'s struggle and so early in life! And unlike the artist or the ascetic, I cannot balance my doubts by means of great deeds. How wretched and loathsome it is to me to be continually wailing like a mire drum.

His eyes are clear now, no longer does he sneer with loathing. Just see how he dances along!","No one talks more passionately about his rights than he who in the depths of his soul doubts whether he has any.","A nation goes to pieces when it confounds its duty with the general concept of duty. Nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every \\"impersonal\\" duty, every sacrifice before the Moloch of abstraction.","N\xf3s, homens do conhecimento, n\xe3o nos conhecemos; de n\xf3s mesmos somos desconhecidos - e n\xe3o sem motivo. Nunca nos procuramos: como poderia acontecer que um dia nos encontr\xe1ssemos? Com raz\xe3o algu\xe9m disse:\'onde estiver teu tesouro, estar\xe1 tamb\xe9m teu cora\xe7\xe3o\'. Nosso tesouro est\xe1 onde est\xe3o as colmeias do nosso conhecimento. Estamos sempre a caminho delas, sendo por natureza criaturas aladas e coletoras do mel do esp\xedrito, tendo no cora\xe7\xe3o apenas um prop\xf3sito - levar algo \'para casa\'.

Pity preserves things that are ripe for decline, it defends things that have been disowned and condemned by life. [\u2026] In the middle of our unhealthy modernity, nothing is less healthy than Christian pity.","We children of the future, how could we be at home in the present? We are unfavourable to all ideals which could make us feel at home in this frail, broken-down, transition period; and as regards the \'realities\' thereof, we do not believe in their endurance. The ice which still carries has become very thin: the thawing wind blows; we ourselves, the homeless ones, are an agency that breaks the ice, and the other too thin \'realities\'.","If thereof I designate as the most dangerous characteristic of the political present the application of revolutionary thought to the service of a selfish stateless gold-aristocracy; if I conceive of the enormous dissemination of liberal optimism as the result of modern financial affairs fallen into strange hands, and if I imagine all the evils of social conditions together with the necessary decay of the arts to have either germinated from that root or grown together along with it, one will have to pardon my occasionally chanting a paean on war.","the feeling of rank is one of the most basic human instincts. To gossip about someone is to elevate yourself above him or her.","Anti-theses. \u2015 The most senile thing ever thought about man is contained in the celebrated saying \'the ego is always hateful\'; the most childish is the even more celebrated \'love thy neighbor as thyself\'. \u2015 In the former, knowledge of human nature has ceased, in the latter it has not yet even begun.","[F]or your true nature lies, not concealed deep within you, but immeasurably high above you, or at least above that which you usually take yourself to be. Your true educators and formative teachers reveal to you what the true basic material of your being is, something in itself ineducable and in any case difficult of access, bound and paralysed: your educators can be only your liberators. That is the secret of all culture: it does not provide artificial limbs, wax noses or spectacles \u2014 that which can provide these things is, rather, only sham education. Culture is liberation, the removal of all the weeds, rubble and vermin that want to attack the tender buds of the plant.","There is a great ladder of religious cruelty with many rungs; but three of them are the most important. At one time one sacrificed human beings to one\'s god, perhaps precisely those human beings one loved best\u2013the sacrifice of the first-born present in all prehistoric religions belongs here, as does the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the Mithras grotto on the isle of Capri, that most horrible of all Roman anachronisms. Then, in the moral epoch of mankind, one sacrificed to one\'s god the strongest instincts one possessed, one\'s \u2018nature\u2019; the joy of this festival glitters in the cruel glance of the ascetic, the inspired \u2018anti-naturist\u2019. Finally: what was left to be sacrificed? Did one not finally have to sacrifice everything comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in a concealed harmony, in a future bliss and justice? Did one not have to sacrifice God himself and out of cruelty against oneself worship stone, stupidity, gravity, fate, nothingness? To sacrifice God for nothingness\u2013this paradoxical mystery of the ultimate act of cruelty was reserved for the generation which is even now arising: we all know something of it already.","Individualism is a modest and still unconscious form of will to power; with it a single human unit seems to think it sufficient to free himself from the preponderating power of society (or of the State or Church). He does not set himself up in opposition as a personality, but merely as a unit; he represents the rights of all other individuals as against the whole. That is to say, he instinctively places himself on a level with every other unit: what he combats he does not combat as a person, but as a representative of units against a mass. [...] When one has reached a certain degree of independence, one always longs for more: separation in proportion to the degree of force; the individual is no longer content to regard himself as equal to everybody, he actually seeks for his peer\u2014he makes himself stand out from others. Individualism is followed by a development in groups and organs; correlative tendencies join up together and become powerfully active: now there arise between these centres of power, friction, war, a reconnoitring of the forces on either side, reciprocity, understandings, and the regulation of mutual services. Finally, there appears an order of rank.","\u0641\u0623\u0646 \u0643\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u062a\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0648 \u0647\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0649 \u062a\u0628\u0639\u062f\u0646\u0649 \u0639\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0649 \u0648 \u062a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0646\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0633\u062d \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0639\u0646\u0649","French philosopher whom professional philosophers generally accord highest honors is Descartes.

Even though the divergences are admittedly tremendous, they are due more to the difference in time, culture and science.

He does not defend his rights, he takes no steps to avert the worst that can happen to him\u2015more, he provokes it . . . And he entreats, he suffers, he loves with those, in those who are doing evil to him. His words to the thief on the cross next to him contain the whole Evangel. \u2018That was verily a divine man, a child of God\u2019\u2015says the thief. \u2018If thou feelest this\u2019\u2015answers the redeemer\u2015\u2018thou art in Paradise, thou art a child of God.\u2019 Not to defend oneself, not to grow angry, not to make responsible . . .

For we comprehend that these self-same instincts are inseparable from life, and one therefore turns against life. Whereas the mass, which has no feeling at all for this conflict, flourishes, while the conflicted type miscarries and, as a product of degeneration, invites antipathy\u2013that the mediocre, on the other hand, when they pose as the goal and meaning of existence, arouse nausea and indignation. And the individual, faced with this tremendous machinery, loses courage and submits. The herd, the mass, \'society\', unlearns modesty and blows up its needs into cosmic and metaphysical values. In this way the whole of existence is vulgarised; and in so far as the mass is dominant it bullies the exceptions, so that they lose faith in themselves and become nihilists.The question \'for what?\', after a painful struggle, even victory. That something is a hundred times more important than the question of whether we feel well or not\u2013and consequently whether others feel well or not. The predominance of suffering over pleasure, or its opposite (hedonism) are already signposts to nihilism. For in both cases no ultimate meaning is posited except the appearance of pleasure or pain. But for any worthy man, the value of life is certainly not measured by the standard of these trifles. A suffering might predominate, and in spite of this, a powerful will might exist, a Yes to life, a need and acceptance of this predominance.","Whatever they may think and say about their \'egoism\', the great majority nonetheless do nothing for their ego their whole life long: what they do is done for the phantom of their ego which has formed itself in the heads of those around them and has been communicated to them;- as a consequence they all of them dwell in a fog of impersonal, semi-personal opinions, and arbitrary, as it were poetical evaluations, the one for ever in the head of someone else, and the head of this someone else again in the heads of others: a strange world of phantasms","I suffer: someone or other must be guilty \\" - Every sick sheep thinks the same.","Let the youthful soul look back on life with the question: what have you truly loved up to now, what has elevated your soul, what has mastered it and at the same time delighted it? Place these venerated objects before you in a row, and perhaps they will yield for you, through their nature and their sequence, a law, the fundamental law of your true self\u2026for your true nature lies, not hidden deep within you, but immeasurably high above you, or at least above that which you normally take to be yourself.","Here in this supreme menace of the will, there approaches aredeeming, healing, enchantress\u2014art.

In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be Nature \\"according to the Stoa,\\" and would like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal glorification and generalism of Stoicism!","Humor is just Schadenfreude with a clear conscience","To Wrench the human soul from its moorings, to immerse it in terrors, ice, flames, and raptures to such an extent that it is liberated from all petty displeasure, gloom and depression as by a flash of lightening: what paths lead to this goal? And which of them do so most surely?","He that as a knowing person has acknowledged that in us, alongside growth of all kinds, the law of perishing is at the same time in force, and that annihilation and decay inexorably impose themselves at the end of every creation and generation: he must learn to experience a kind of joy at such a sight, in order to bear it, or he is no longer good for knowing. That is, he must be capable of a refined cruelty and get used to it with a resolute heart. If his force is even higher in the rank-ordering of forces, he himself is one of the creators and not just a spectator: so it is not enough that he is capable of cruelty only in seeing so much suffering, so much extinction, so much destruction; such a human being must be able to create pain with pleasure, to be cruel with hand and deed (and not just with the eyes of the spirit).","History belongs, above all, to the active and powerful man, the man who fights one great battle, who needs the exemplary men, teachers, and comforters and cannot find them among his contemporary companions. Thus, history belongs to Schiller: for our age is so bad, said Goethe, that the poet no longer encounters any useful nature in the human life surrounding him. Looking back to the active men, Polybius calls political history an example of the right preparation for ruling a state and the most outstanding teacher, something which, through the memory of other people\'s accidents, advises us to bear with resolution the changes in our happiness. Anyone who has learned to recognize the sense of history in this way must get annoyed to see inquisitive travellers or painstaking micrologists climbing all over the pyramids of the great things of the past. There, in the place where he finds the stimulation to breath deeply and to make things better, he does not wish to come across an idler who strolls around, greedy for distraction or stimulation, as among the accumulated art treasures of a gallery.In order not to despair and feel disgust in the midst of weak and hopeless idlers, surrounded by apparently active, but really only agitated and fidgeting companions, the active man looks behind him and interrupts the path to his goal to take a momentary deep breath. His purpose is some happiness or other, perhaps not his own, often that of a people or of humanity collectively. He runs back away from resignation and uses history as a way of fighting resignation. For the most part, no reward beckons him on, other than fame, that is, becoming a candidate for an honoured place in the temple of history, where he himself can be, in his turn, a teacher, consoler, and advisor for those who come later.","One should be harsher with Protestants than with Catholics, harsher with liberal Protestants than with orthodox ones.

The conditions under which a strong, noble species maintains itself (in the matter of intellectual discipline) are precisely the reverse of those under which the industrial masses \u2014 the tea-grocers \xe0 la Spencer \u2014 subsist. Those qualities which are within the grasp only of the strongest and most terrible natures, and which make their existence possible leisure, adventure, disbelief, and even dissipation \u2014 would necessarily ruin mediocre natures \u2014 and does do so \u2014 when they possess them. In the case of the latter industry, regularity, moderation, and strong \'conviction\' are in their proper place \u2014 in short, all \'gregarious virtues\': under their influence these mediocre men become perfect.","... for the objective of all human arrangements is through distracting one\'s thoughts to cease to be aware of life.","The \u201cpure spirit is a piece of pure stupidity: take away the nervous system and the senses, the so-called \u201cmortal shell,\u201d and the rest is miscalculation\u2014that is all!...\u201d","So lernte ich bei Zeiten schweigen, so wie, dass man reden lernen m\xfcsse, um recht zu schweigen: dass ein Mensch mit Hintergr\xfcnden Vordergr\xfcnde n\xf6tig habe, sei es f\xfcr Andere, sei es f\xfcr sich selber: denn die Vordergr\xfcnde sind einem n\xf6tig, um von sich selber sich zu erholen, und um es Anderen m\xf6glich zu machen, mit uns zu leben.","...his wisdom meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.","But what if pleasure and pain should be so closely connected, Nietzsche asked in his book The Gay Science, \u201cthat he who wants the greatest possible amount of one must also have the greatest possible amount of the other?\u201d","There is one thing one has to have: either a cheerful disposition by nature or a disposition made cheerful by art and knowledge","The fact that humanity knelt down before the opposite of the origin, the meaning, the right of the evangel, the fact that in the concept of \u2018church\u2019, humanity canonized the very thing the \u2018bearer of glad tidings\u2019 felt to be beneath him, behind him - you will not find a greater example of world-historical irony - -","The drive toward the formation of metaphors is the fundamental human drive, which one cannot for a single instant dispense with in thought, for one would thereby dispense with man himself.","Si miras al abismo, el abismo devuelve siempre la mirada.","Il n\u2019y a pas de faits , mais seulement des interpr\xe9tations .","Only men of the utmost simplicity can believe that the nature man knows can be changed into a purely logical nature. Yet were there steps affording approach to this goal, how utterly everything would be lost on the way! Even the most rational man needs nature again, from time to time, that is, his illogical fundamental relation (Grundstellung) to all things.No practical knowledge of a man, for example, stood he never so near to us, can be complete\u2014so that we could have a logical right to form a total estimate of him; all estimates are summary and must be so. Then the standard by which we measure, (our being) is not an immutable quantity; we have moods and variations, and yet we should know ourselves as an invariable standard before we undertake to establish the nature of the relation of any thing (Sache) to ourselves. Perhaps it will follow from all this that one should form no judgments whatever; if one could but merely live without having to form estimates, without aversion and without partiality!\u2014for everything most abhorred is closely connected with an estimate, as well as every strongest partiality. An inclination towards a thing, or from a thing, without an accompanying feeling that the beneficial is desired and the pernicious contemned, an inclination without a sort of experiential estimation of the desirability of an end, does not exist in man. We are primordially illogical and hence unjust beings and can recognise this fact: this is one of the greatest and most baffling discords of existence.","flee, my friend, into thy solitude! i see thee defended with the noise of great men, and stung all over with the stings of little ones. Admirably do forest and rock know how to be silent with thee. resemble again the tree which thou lovest","Similar to the way in which astrologers considered the stars to be in man \'s serviceand connected with his happiness and sorrow, such an investigator considers the entire universe in connection with man","My conception of freedom. \u2014 The value of a thing sometimes does not lie in that which one attains by it, but in what one pays for it \u2014 what it costs us. I shall give an example. Liberal institutions cease to be liberal as soon as they are attained: later on, there are no worse and no more thorough injurers of freedom than liberal institutions. Their effects are known well enough: they undermine the will to power; they level mountain and valley, and call that morality; they make men small, cowardly, and hedonistic \u2014 every time it is the herd animal that triumphs with them. Liberalism: in other words, herd-animalization.These same institutions produce quite different effects while they are still being fought for; then they really promote freedom in a powerful way. On closer inspection it is war that produces these effects, the war for liberal institutions, which, as a war, permits illiberal instincts to continue. And war educates for freedom. For what is freedom? That one has the will to assume responsibility for oneself. That one maintains the distance which separates us. That one becomes more indifferent to difficulties, hardships, privation, even to life itself. That one is prepared to sacrifice human beings for one\'s cause, not excluding oneself. Freedom means that the manly instincts which delight in war and victory dominate over other instincts, for example, over those of \\"pleasure.\\" The human being who has become free \u2014 and how much more the spirit who has become free \u2014 spits on the contemptible type of well-being dreamed of by shopkeepers, Christians, cows, females, Englishmen, and other democrats. The free man is a warrior.How is freedom measured in individuals and peoples? According to the resistance which must be overcome, according to the exertion required, to remain on top. The highest type of free men should be sought where the highest resistance is constantly overcome: five steps from tyranny, close to the threshold of the danger of servitude. This is true psychologically if by \\"tyrants\\" are meant inexorable and fearful instincts that provoke the maximum of authority and discipline against themselves; most beautiful type: Julius Caesar. This is true politically too; one need only go through history. The peoples who had some value, attained some value, never attained it under liberal institutions: it was great danger that made something of them that merits respect. Danger alone acquaints us with our own resources, our virtues, our armor and weapons, our spirit, and forces us to be strong. First principle: one must need to be strong \u2014 otherwise one will never become strong.Those large hothouses for the strong \u2014 for the strongest kind of human being that has so far been known \u2014 the aristocratic commonwealths of the type of Rome or Venice, understood freedom exactly in the sense in which I understand it: as something one has or does not have, something one wants, something one conquers.","I soon learned to separate theological from moral prejudices, and I gave up looking for a supernatural origin of evil.

Such beings violate our every assumption: they come unexpectedly, without cause, reason, notice, excuse; they appear as suddenly as lightning, and are too terrible, too sudden, too convincing, too \u2018different\u2019 even to be hated. Their work is the instinctive creation and imposition of forms; of all artists, their work is the most instinctive, unconscious \u2013 in connection with appearance there arises something new, a system of governance which is alive , in which the functions and parts are defined and related to one another, in which above all no part finds a place unless it has some \u2018function\u2019 in connection with the whole. These instinctive organizers, they know nothing of guilt, responsibility, consideration; they are subject to that terrible artist-egoism which gleams like brass, and which sees itself justified to all eternity, in its work, even as a mother sees in her child.","He who fights monsters might take care, lest he thereby become a monster.","The greatest accomplishment of past mankind is that weno longer have to live in continual fear of wild animals, ofbarbarians, of gods and of our own dreams.","The reason why the powerful man is grateful is this: his benefactor, through the benefit he confers, has mistaken and intruded into the sphere of the powerful man, now the latter, in return, penetrates into the sphere of the benefactor by the act of gratitude. It is a milder form of revenge. Without the satisfaction of gratitude the powerful man would have shown himself powerless and would have been reckoned as such ever after. Therefore every society of the good, which originally meant; the powerful, places gratitude amongst the first duties. Swift propounded the maxim that men were grateful in the same proportion as they were revengeful.","Today we no longer have any pity for the concept of \\"free will\\": we know only too well what it really is \u2014 the foulest of all theologians\' artifices, aimed at making mankind \\"responsible\\" in their sense, that is, dependent upon them.

Of course when he suffers, he suffers more severely; indeed he suffers more frequently because he does not know how to learn from experience and keeps on falling into the very same trap time after time. When he is suffering he is just as unreasonable as he is when he is happy, he shouts out loudly and knows no solace. How differently the same misfortune is endured by the stoic who has learned fro experience and who governs himself by means of concepts! This man, who otherwise seeks only honesty, truth, freedom from illusions, and protection from the onslaughts of things which might distract him, now performs, in the midst of misfortune, a masterpiece of pretence, just as the other did in the midst of happiness: he does not wear a twitching, mobile, human face, but rather a mask, as it were, with its features in dignified equilibrium; he does not shut, nor does he even change his tone of voice. If a veritable storm-cloud empties itself on his head, he wraps himself in his cloak and slowly walks away from under it.","After an eventful journey - it was even life-threatening because of flooding in Como, which I only reached late at night - I arrived in Turin on the afternoon of the 21st, my proven place, my residence from then on.

This is the same sense of self-possession which characterizes the dramatic artist who transforms himself into alien bodies and talks with their alien tongues and yet can project this transformation into written verse that exists in the outside world on its own. What verse is for the poet, dialectical thinking is for the philosopher. He grasps for it in order to get hold of his own enchantment, in order to perpetuate it.","Just see these superfluous ones!

We permit ourselves a tame barbarism: just look at our artists and statesmen.","The more a psychologist\u2014a born, an unavoidable psychologist and soul-diviner\u2014turns his attention to the more select cases and individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man.

Revolutionary France, and even more, prerevolutionary France, would have brought forth the opposite type; in fact, it did. Because Napoleon was different, the heir of a stronger, older, more ancient civilization than the one which was then perishing in France, he became the master there, he was the only master. Great men are necessary, the age in which they appearis accidental; that they almost always become masters over their age is only because they are stronger, because they are older, because for a longer time much was gathered for them. The relationship between a genius and his age is like that between strong and weak, or between old and young: the age is relatively always much younger, thinner, more immature, less assured, more childish.","His word pronounced \u2018selfishness\u2019 blessed, the wholesomehealthy selfishness that wells from a powerful soul\u2014froma powerful soul to which belongs the high body, beautiful,triumphant, refreshing, around which everythingbecomes a mirror\u2014the supple, persuasive body, thedancer whose parable and epitome is the self-enjoyingsoul.","Das Leben besteht aus seltenen einzelnen Momenten von h\xf6chster Bedeutsamkeit und unz\xe4hlig vielen Intervallen, in denen uns besten Falls die Schattenbilder jener Momente umschweben.

The emergence of pessimisticphilosophies is by no means a sign of great and terriblemisery. No, these question marks about the value of alllife are put up in ages in which the refinement andalleviation of existence make even the inevitable mosquitobites of the soul and the body seem much too bloody andmalignant and one is so poor in real experiences of painthat one would like to consider painful general ideas assuffering of the first order.There is a recipeagainst pessimistic philosophers and the excessive sensitivitythat seems to me the real \\"misery of the present age\\"----but this recipe may sound too cruel and mightitself be counted among the signs that lead peopleto judge that \\"existence is something evil.\\"Well, the recipe against this \\"misery\\" is: misery","To some people you may give not your hand, but only a slap with a paw: and I would at your paw might also have claws.","And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.","To speak about oneself not at all is a very refined form of hypocrisy.","But the worst enemy you can encounter will always be yourself.","How each sex has its own prejudice about love \u2014 Despite all the concessions that I am willing to make to the prejudice in favor of monogamy, I will never admit the claim that man and woman have equal rights in love; these do not exist. For man and woman have different conceptions of love; and it is one of the conditions of love in both sexes that neither sex presupposes the same feeling and the same concept of \u201clove in the other. What woman means by love is clear enough: total devotion (not mere surrender98) with soul and body, without any consideration or reserve, rather with shame and horror at the thought of a devotion that might be subject to special clauses or conditions. In this absence of conditions her love is a faith; woman has no other faith. Man, when he loves a woman, wants precisely this love from her and is thus himself as far as can be from the presupposition of feminine love. Supposing, however, that there should also be men to whom the desire for total devotion is not alien; well, then they simply are\u2014not men. A man who loves like a woman becomes a slave; while a woman who loves like a woman becomes a more perfect woman. A woman\u2019s passion in its unconditional renunciation of rights of her own presupposes precisely that on the other side there is no equal pathos, no equal will to renunciation; for if both partners felt impelled by love to renounce themselves, we should then get\u2014I do not know what; perhaps an empty space? Woman wants to be taken and accepted as a possession, wants to be absorbed into the concept of possession, possessed Consequently, she wants someone who takes, who does not give himself or give himself away; on the contrary, he is supposed to become richer in \u201chimself\u201d\u2014through the accretion of strength, happiness, and faith given him by the woman who gives herself. Woman gives herself away, man acquires more\u2014I do not see how one can get around this natural opposition by means of social contracts or with the best will in the world to be just, desirable as it may be not to remind oneself constantly how harsh, terrible, enigmatic, and immoral this antagonism is. For love, thought of in its entirety as great and full, is nature, and being nature it is in all eternity something \u201cimmoral.\u201d Faithfulness is accordingly included in woman\u2019s love; it follows from the definition. In man, it can easily develop in the wake of his love, perhaps as gratitude or as an idiosyncratic taste and so-called elective affinity; but it is not an essential element of his love\u2014so definitely not that one might almost speak with some justification of a natural counterplay of love and faithfulness in man. For his love consists of wanting to have and not of renunciation and giving away; but wanting to have always comes to an end with having. It is actually man\u2019s more refined and suspicious lust for possession that rarely admits his \u201chaving,\u201d and then only late, and thus permits his love to persist. It is even possible for his love to increase after the surrender; he will not readily concede that a woman should have nothing more to give him.\u2014\u201d","Humanity does not strive for happiness; only the English do.","In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall.","Your true educators and formative teachers reveal to you that the true, original meaning and basic stuff of your nature is something completely incapable of being educated or formed and is in any case something difficult of access, bound and paralysed.","The sciences, pursued without any restraint and in a spirit of the blindest laissez faire, are shattering and dissolving all firmly held belief; the educated classes and states are being swept along by a hugely contemptible money economy. The world has never been more worldly, never poorer in love and goodness. The educated classes are no longer lighthouses or refuges in the midst of this turmoil of secularization; they themselves grow daily more restless, thoughtless and loveless. Everything, contemporary art and science included, serves the coming barbarism. The cultured man has degenerated to the greatest enemy of culture, for he wants lyingly to deny the existence of the universal sickness and thus obstructs the physicians.","I love him who justifies the future ones, and redeems the past ones: for he is willing to perish through the present ones.","The development of speech and the development of consciousness (not of reason, but of reason becoming self-conscious) go hand in hand. Let it be further accepted that it is not only speech that serves as a bridge between man and man, but also the looks, the pressure and the gestures; our becoming conscious of our sense impressions, our power of being able to fix them, and as it were to locate them outside of ourselves, has increased in proportion as the necessity has increased for communicating them to others by means of signs. The sign-inventing man is at the same time the man who is always more acutely self-conscious; it is only as a social animal that man has learned to become conscious of himself, - he is doing so still, and doing so more and more. - As is obvious, my idea is that consciousness does not properly belong to the individual existence of man, but rather to the social and gregarious nature in him; that, as follows therefrom, it is only in relation to communal and gregarious utility that it is finely developed; and that consequently each of us, in spite of the best intention of understanding himself as individually as possible, and of \\"knowing himself,\\" will always just call into consciousness the non-individual in him, namely, his \\"averageness\\"; - that our thought itself is continuously as it were outvoted by the character of consciousness - by the imperious \\"genius of the species\\" therein - and is translated back into the perspective of the herd.","It is important to accept that the world is not in any way striving toward a stable condition, equilibrium or eternal sunshine.","What then are our experiences?
