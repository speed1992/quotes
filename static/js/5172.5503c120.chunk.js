Aim to be antifragile","A Stoic is someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking.","To bankrupt a fool, give him information.","Muscles without strength, friendship without trust, opinion without risk, change without aesthetics, age without values, food without nourishment, power without fairness, facts without rigor, degrees without erudition, militarism without fortitude, progress without civilization, complication without depth, fluency without content; these are the sins to remember.","The fastest way to become rich is to socialize with the poor; the fastest way to become poor is to socialize with the rich.","Karl Marx, a visionary, figured out that you can control a slave much better by convincing him he is an employee.","Someone who says \\"I am busy\\" is either declaring incompetence (and lack of control of his life) or trying to get rid of you.","If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.","Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that\u2019s what you are seeking.","Life is a tightrope between two errors: generalizing the wrong particular and particularizing the wrong general.","Doctors most commonly get mixed up between absence of evidence and evidence of abense","People are much less interested in what you are trying to show them than what you are trying to hide.","Those who do not think that employment is systemic slavery are either blind or employed.","Avoid losers. If you hear someone use the words \'impossible\', \'never\', \'too difficult\' too often, drop him or her from your social network.","The central idea in The Black Swan is that: rare events cannot be estimated from empirical observation since they are rare.","The curious mind embraces science; the gifted and sensitive, the arts; the practical, business; the leftover becomes an economist","You don\'t become completely free by just avoiding being a slave; you also need to avoid becoming a master.","Only the autodidacts are free.","An ad hominem attack against an individual, not against an idea, is highly flattering. It indicates that the person does not have anything intelligent to say about your message.","The only valid political system is one that can handle an imbecile in power without suffering from it","...maximize the serendipity around you.","The psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer has a simple heuristic. Never ask the doctor what you should do. Ask him what he would do if he were in your place. You would be surprised at the difference","The weak shows his strength and hides his weaknesses; the magnificent exhibits his weaknesses like ornaments.","Asking science to explain life and vital matters is equivalent to asking a grammarian to explain poetry.","People focus on role models; it is more effective to find antimodels - people you don\'t want to resemble when you grow up","Don\'t cross a river if it is four feet deep on average.","You find peace by coming to terms with what you don\'t know.","There are systems that use failure as fuel for improvement, where the cost of failure is small.","Heroes are heroes because they are heroic in behavior, not because they won or lost.","An idea starts to be interesting when you get scared of taking it to its logical conclusion.","If you roll dice, you know that the odds are one in six that the dice will come up on a particular side.

But, in the stock market, such computations are bull - you don\'t even know how many sides the dice have!","The difference between technology and slavery is that slaves are fully aware that they are not free","You will get the most attention from those who hate you. No friend, no admirer and no partner will flatter you with as much curiosity.","At no point in history have so many non-risk-takers, that is, those with no personal exposure, exerted so much control.","It does not matter how frequently something succeeds if failure is too costly to bear.","An elephant is vastly more efficient, metabolically, than a mouse. It\'s the same for a megacity as opposed to a village. But an elephant can break a leg very easily, whereas you can toss a mouse out of a window and it\'ll be fine. Size makes you fragile.","It is a sign of weakness to avoid showing signs of weakness.","Anything that provides you with very, very stable income, very stable conditions, maybe generally stable, that often, it masks real risks, risks of blow-ups.","The problem of knowledge is that there are many more books on birds written by ornithologists than books on birds written by birds and books on ornithologists written by birds","Love without sacrifice is like theft","When you ask people, \'What\'s the opposite of fragile?,\' they tend to say robust, resilient, adaptable, solid, strong. That\'s not it. The opposite of fragile is something that gains from disorder.","You will be civilized on the day you can spend a long period doing nothing, learning nothing, and improving nothing, without feeling the slightest amount of guilt.","In science you need to understand the world; in business you need others to misunderstand it.","They think that intelligence is about noticing things are relevant (detecting patterns); in a complex world, intelligence consists in ignoring things that are irrelevant (avoiding false patterns)","When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.","Paul Krugman is a danger to society!","Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg didn\'t finish college.

Never think that lack of variability is stability.","Banks have never made money in the history of banking, losing the equivalent of all their past profits periodically - while bankers strike it rich.","We know from chaos theory that even if you had a perfect model of the world, you\'d need infinite precision in order to predict future events. With sociopolitical or economic phenomena, we don\'t have anything like that.","The person you are most afraid to contradict is yourself.","If there is something in nature you don\'t understand, odds are it makes sense in a deeper way that is beyond your understanding. So there is a logic to natural things that is much superior to our own. Just as there is a dichotomy in law: \'innocent until proven guilty\' as opposed to \'guilty until proven innocent\', let me express my rule as follows: what Mother Nature does is rigorous until proven otherwise; what humans and science do is flawed until proven otherwise.","Only in recent history has \\"working hard\\" signaled pride rather than shame for lack of talent, finesse and, mostly, sprezzatura .","Being an entrepreneur is an existential, not just a financial thing.","The traits I respect are erudition and the courage to stand up when half-men are afraid for their reputation. Any idiot can be intelligent.","There is a certain category of fool-the overeducated, the academic, the journalist, the newspaper reader, the mechanistic scientist, the pseudo-empiricist, those endowed with what I call epistemic arrogance, this wonderful ability to discount what they did not see, the unobserved.","Debt is a mistake between lender and borrower, and both should suffer.","To succeed in life requires a total inability to do anything that makes you uncomfortable when you look at yourself in the mirror.","What I learned on my own I still remember","A man without a heroic bent starts dying at the age of thirty.","What is nonmeasurable and nonpredictable will remain nonmeasurable and nonpredictable ... no matter how much hate mail I get.","If you have more than one reason to do something (choose a doctor or veterinarian, hire a gardener or an employee, marry a person, go on a trip), just don\u2019t do it. It does not mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more than one reason you are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason.","By setting oneself totally free of constraints, free of thoughts, free of this debilitating activity called work, free of efforts, elements hidden in the texture of reality start staring at you; then mysteries that you never thought existed emerge in front of your eyes.","You need a story to displace a story.","Modernity: we created youth without heroism, age without wisdom, and life without grandeur","You exist if and only if you are free to do things without a visible objective, with no justification and, above all, outside the dictatorship of someone else\'s narrative.","Go to parties. You can\'t even start to know what you may find on the envelope of serendipity. If you suffer from agoraphobia, send colleagues.","Restaurants get you in with food to sell you liquor; religions get you in with belief to sell you rules.","Someone bemoaned that there were so few women in economics. But there are also very few men in economics.","If you don\'t feel that you haven\'t read enough, you haven\'t read enough.","The imagination of the genius vastly surpasses his intellect; the intellect of the academic vastly surpasses his imagination","Never think that lack of variability is stability. Don\'t confuse lack of volatility with stability, ever.","In economic life and history more generally, just about everything of consequence comes from black swans; ordinary events have paltry effects in the long term.","Categorizing is necessary for humans, but it becomes pathological when the category is seen as definitive, preventing people from considering the fuzziness of boundaries, let alone revising their categories.","Never take advice from someone wearing a tie.","It takes extraordinary wisdom and self-control to accept that many things have a logic we do not understand that is smarter than our own.","If you want to annoy a poet, explain his poetry.","Many people keep deploring the low level of formal education in the United states (as defined by, say, math grades). Yet these fail to realize that the new comes from here and gets imitated elsewhere. And it is not thanks to universities, which obviously claim a lot more credit than their accomplishments warrant. Like Britain in the Industrial Revolution, America\'s asset is, simply, risk taking and the use of optionality, this remarkable ability to engage in rational forms fo trial and error, with no comparative shame in failing again, starting again, and repeating failure.","Probability is not a mere computation of odds on the dice or more complicated variants; it is the acceptance of the lack of certainty in our knowledge and the development of methods for dealing with our ignorance.","Stoicism is about the *domestication* of emotions, not their elimination.","Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.","Meditation is a way to be narcissistic without hurting anyone","Failure saves lives. In the airline industry, every time a plane crashes the probability of the next crash is lowered by that. The Titanic saved lives because we\'re building bigger and bigger ships. So these people died, but we have effectively improved the safety of the system, and nothing failed in vain.","An option hides where we don\'t want it to hide.","We should reward people, not ridicule them, for thinking the impossible.","Umberto Eco is the owner of a large personal library of almost 30,000 books that he has not read. [To him] read books are far less valuable than unread ones.","It is my great hope someday, to see science and decision makers rediscover what the ancients have always known. Namely that our highest currency is respect.","Few understand that procrastination is our natural defense, letting things take care of themselves and exercise their antifragility; it results from some ecological or naturalistic wisdom, and is not always bad - at an existential level, it is my body rebelling against its entrapment. It is my soul fighting the Procrustean bed of modernity.","Daily news and sugar confuse our system in the same manner.","The irony of the process of thought control: the more energy you put into trying to control your ideas and what you think about, the more your ideas end up controlling you.","Just as being nice to the arrogant is no better than being arrogant toward the nice, being accommodating toward anyone committing a nefarious action condones it.","Failure saves lives. In the airline industry, every time a plane crashes the probability of the next crash is lowered by that.","The best test of whether someone is extremely stupid (or extremely wise) is whether financial and political news makes sense to him.","What America does best is produce the ability to accept failure.","You want to favor systems that benefit from error, disorder, variability and things like that. You want to favor these systems and unfortunately, when - there\'s something I call the Soviet Illusion. The more the government becomes intrusive, the more things have to follow a script, and it can\'t handle this kind of system.","Wittgenstein\'s ruler: Unless you have confidence in the ruler\'s reliability, if you use a ruler to measure a table you may also be using the table to measure the ruler.","The characteristic feature of the loser is to bemoan, in general terms, mankind\'s flaws, biases, contradictions, and irrationality - without exploiting them for fun and profit","I want to live happily in a world I don\u2019t understand.","You get pseudo-order when you seek order; you only get a measure of order and control when you embrace randomness.","The opposite of fragile is something that gains from disorder.","We glorify those who left their names in history books at the expense of those contributors about whom our books are silent. We humans are not just a superficial race - we are a very unfair one.","The same past data can confirm a theory and its exact opposite! If you survive until tomorrow, it could mean that either a) you are more likely to be immortal or b) that you are closer to death.","Answer e-mails from junior people before more senior ones. Junior people have further to go and tend to remember who slighted them.","If you hear a \\"prominent\\" economist using the word \'equilibrium,\' or \'normal distribution,\' do not argue with him; just ignore him, or try to put a rat down his shirt.","The sucker\'s trap is when you focus on what you know and what others don\'t know, rather than the reverse.","Greatness starts with the replacement of hatred with polite disdain.","Don\'t ask the barber whether you need a haircut, and don\'t ask an academic if what he does is relevant.","By all means, avoid words\u2014threats, complaints, justification, narratives, reframing, attempts to win arguments, supplications; avoid words!","Wear your best for your execution and stand dignified. Your last recourse against randomness is how you act - if you can\'t control outcomes, you can control the elegance of your behaviour. You will always have the last word.","We tend to treat our knowledge as personal property to be protected and defended.  It is an ornament that allows us to rise in the pecking order. [...] We take what we know a little too seriously.","A good maxim allows you to have the last word without even starting a conversation.","If you sat with a pencil and jotted down all the decisions you\'ve taken in the past week, or, if you could, over your lifetime, you would realize that almost all of them have had asymmetric payoff, with one side carrying a larger consequence than the other. You decide principally based on fragility, not probability. Or to rephrase, You decide principally based on fragility, not so much on True/False.","Those who were unlucky in life in spite of their skills would eventually rise. The lucky fool might have benefited from some luck in life; over the longer run he would slowly converge to the state of a less-lucky idiot. Each one would revert to his long-term properties.","In poor countries, officials receive explicit bribes; in D.C. they get the sophisticated, implicit, unspoken promise to work for large corporations","Older people are most beautiful when they have what is lacking in the young: poise, erudition, wisdom, phronesis, and this post-heroic absence of agitation.","The classical man\'s worst fear was inglorious death; the modern man\'s worst fear is just death","Remember that you are a Black Swan.","The difference between slaves in Roman and Ottoman days and today\'s employees is that slaves did not need to flatter their boss.","There are secrets to our world that only practice can reveal, and no opinion or analysis will ever capture in full.","When we want to do something while unconsciously certain to fail, we seek advice so we can blame someone else for the failure.","When some systems are stuck in a dangerous impasse, randomness and only randomness can unlock them and set them free.","The fragile wants tranquility, the antifragile grows from disorder, and the robust doesn\'t care too much.","We cannot truly plan, because we do not understand the future-but this is not necessarily a bad news. We could plan while bearing in mind such limitations. It just takes guts.","For the classics philosophical insight was the product of a life of leisure; for me a life of leisure is the product of philosophical insight.","We should probably stop trading derivatives, anything more complex than regular options ... I am an options trader, and I don\'t understand options. How do you want a regulator to understand them?","The best philosophers were not academics, but had another job, so their philosophy was not corrupted by careerism.","If one puts an infinite number of monkeys in front of typewriters, and lets them clap away, there is a certainty that one of them will come out with an exact version of the \'Iliad.\'","Don\'t disturb complicated systems that have been around for a very long time. We don\'t understand their logic. Don\'t pollute the planet. Leave it the way we found it, regardless of scientific \'evidence\'.","Much of aging comes from a misunderstanding of the effect of comfort.","Redundancy is ambiguous because it seems like a waste if nothing unusual happens. Except that something unusual happens-usually .","What they call \\"play\\" (gym, travel, sports) looks like work.","An erudite is someone who displays less than he knows; a journalist or consultant the opposite.","This is the tragedy of modernity: as with neurotically overprotective parents, those trying to help are often hurting us the most.","Make sure that you are in a situation where the constant mistakes are small and can be used for something.","The fool generalizes the particular; the nerd particularizes the general; some do both; and the wise does neither","Simplicity is not so simple to attain.","What fools call \\"wasting time\\" is most often the best investment.","Suckers think that you cure greed with money, addiction with substances, expert problems with experts, banking with bankers, economics with economists, and debt crises with debt spending","To become a philosopher, start by walking very slowly.","If my detractors knew me better they would hate me even more.","He who has never sinned is less reliable than he who has only sinned once. And someone who has made plenty of errors-though never the same error more than once-is more reliable than someone who has never made any.","The worst side effect of wealth is the social associations it forces on its victims, as people with big houses end up socializing with other people with big houses.","A prophet is not someone with special visions, just someone blind to most of what others see","Alan Greenspan is unskilled; you don\'t take the unskilled seriously.","Ideas come and go, stories stay.","Writing is the art of repeating oneself without anyone noticing.","When I trade, I don\'t have an agency problem; I have my neck on the line. When a bank or banker trades, it\'s not his neck on the line.","Half of the people lie with their lips; the other half with their tears","Modernity has replaced ethics with legalese, and the law can be gamed with a good lawyer.","Rank beliefs not according to their plausibility but by the harm they may cause.","Success is about honour, feeling morally calibrated, absence of shame, not what some newspaper defines from an external metric.","Let me be more aggressive: we are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. I\u2019d rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time.","I hated school because I liked to daydream and the system tried to stop me from that.","I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or \\"incentives\\" for skill.","Information is antifragile; it feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.","A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of the information until that point.","Hard work will get you a professorship or a BMW. You need both work and luck for a Booker, a Nobel or a private jet.","A country\'s assets reside in the tinkerers, the hobbyists, and the risk-takers.","To be completely cured of newspapers, spend a year reading the previous week\'s newspapers.","Nobody reads the disclosures that roll down your computer screen. You click \'I agree\' but you don\'t know what you\'re agreeing to.","I\'ve debated many economists who claim to specialize in risk and probability: when one takes them slightly outside their narrow focus, but within the discipline of probability, they fall apart, with the disconsolate face of a gym rat in front of a gangster hit man.","I remind myself of Einstein\'s remark that common sense is nothing but a collection of misconceptions acquired by age 18.","Scientists don\'t know what they are talking about when they talk about religion. Religion has nothing to do with belief, and I don\'t believe it has any negative impact on people\'s lives outside of intolerance. Why do I go to church? It\'s like asking, why did you marry that woman? You make up reasons, but it\'s probably just smell. I love the smell of candles. It\'s an aesthetic thing.","Mental clarity is the child of courage, not the other way around.","Most so-called writers keep writing and writing with the hope, some day, to find something to say.","When you beat up someone physically, you get excercise and stress relief; when you assault him verbally on the Internet, you just harm yourself.","You want failures to be small and informational. Silicon Valley does very well. It knows how to use failure as a tool for improvement.","The narrative fallacy addresses our limited ability to look at sequences of facts without weaving an explanation into them, or, equivalently, forcing a logical link, an arrow of relationship, upon them. Explanations bind facts together. They make them all the more easily remembered; they help them make more sense. Where this propensity can go wrong is when it increases our impression of understanding.","Dress your best on your execution day. Be extremely courteous to your assistant when you lose money. Try not to blame others for your fate, even if they deserve blame. Never exhibit any self-pity. Do not complain.","People work out, they stress their body, and their body gets stronger from stress.","It is remarkable how fast and how effectively you can construct a nationality with a flag , a few speeches, and a national anthem; to this day I avoid the label \\"Lebanese,\\" preferring the less restrictive \\"Levantine\\" designation.","There is no effective difference between guessing a variable that is not random, but for which information is partial or deficient, and a random one. In this sense, guessing (what I don\'t know, but what someone else may know) and predicting (what has not taken place yet) are the same thing.","I have respect for mother nature\'s methods of robustness (billions of years allow most of what is fragile to break); classical thought is more robust (in its respect for the unknown, the epistemic humility) than the modern post-Enlightenment na\xefve pseudoscientific autism. Thus my classical values make me advocate the triplet of erudition, elegance, and courage; against modernity\'s phoniness, nerdiness and philistinism","Is the economy something organic or is it something engineered? I think it\'s closer to the organic. You harm it by artificially suppressing volatility in it.","If I could predict what my day would exactly look like, I would feel a little bit dead.","Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market alow you to put there.","When an investor focuses on short-term investments, he or she is observing the variability of the portfolio, not the returns - in short, being fooled by randomness.","We tend to use knowledge as therapy.","My major hobby is teasing people who take themselves and the quality of their knowledge too seriously and those who don\'t have the guts to sometimes say: I don\'t know.","Scientists may be in the business of laughing at their predecessors, but owing to an array of human mental dispositions, few realize that someone will laugh at their beliefs in the (disappointingly near) future.","Democracies can\'t handle austerity measures very well.","Never ask anyone for their opinion, forecast, or recommendation. Just ask them what they have\u2014or don\u2019t have\u2014in their portfolio.","Forecasting by bureaucrats tends to be used for anxiety relief rather than for adequate policy making.","What organized dating sites fail to understand is that the people are far more interesting in what they don\'t say about themselves.","[A] theory is a very dangerous thing to have.","Work hard, not in grunt work, but in chasing such opportunities and maximizing exposure to them. This makes living in big cities invaluable because you increase the odds of serendipitous encounters-you gain exposure to the envelope of serendipity.","My biggest problem with modernity may lie in the growing separation of the ethical and the legal","This is the central illusion in life: that randomness is a risk, that it is a bad thing.","We learn the most from fools ... yet we pay them back with the worst ingratitude.","The best way to learn a language may be an episode of jail in a foreign country.","Education makes the wise slightly wiser, but it makes the fool vastly more dangerous.","Experience is devoid of the cherry-picking that we find in studies.","You are rich if and only if money you refuse tastes better than money you accept.","My nightmare scenario is that the government saves Citibank once again, as well as the other banks, and business resumes as usual. Then, the next time the system breaks, it breaks much, much bigger.","Never ask a trader if he is profitable: you can easily see it in his gesture and gait.","Injecting some confusion stabilizes the system.","You want to be yourself, idiosyncratic; the collective (school, rules, jobs, technology) wants you generic to the point of castration.","Probability is not about the odds, but about the belief in the existence of an alternative outcome, cause, or motive.","The Internet allows the small guy a global marketplace. But technology is harmful in the sense that we get too much information from it. Because of the web we get 10 times the amount of noise we ever got, which makes harmful fallacies far more likely.","A verbal threat is the most authentic certificate of impotence.","Much of modern life is preventable chronic stress injury.","Economics make homeopath and alternative healers look empirical and scientific.","The book is the only medium left that hasn\'t been corrupted by the profane.","History is opaque. You see what comes out, not the script that produces events, [...] The generator of historical events is different from the events themselves, much as the minds of the gods cannot be read just by witnessing their deeds.","If something is going on, I hear about it. I like to talk to people, I socialise. Television is a waste of time. Human contact is what matters.","Fragility is the quality of things that are vulnerable to volatility.","People used to wear ordinary clothes weekdays, and formal attire on Sunday. Today it is the exact reverse.","Few understand that procrastination is our natural defense, letting things take care of themselves and exercise their antifragility.","I always remind myself that what one observes is at best a combination of variance and returns, not just returns.","Maximum of an average is necessarily less volatile than the average maximum","Banking is a very treacherous business because you don\'t realize it is risky until it is too late. It is like calm waters that deliver huge storms.","Poverty is clearly one source of emotional suffering, but there are others, like loneliness.","If you let markets - in general, my belief is that if you let markets give you information, they\'ll give you the information rather than artificially prop up everything.","If you\'re going to fail, you\'d rather fail early than fail late in general.","My point taken further is that True and False (hence what we call \\"belief\\") play a poor, secondary role in human decisions; it is the payoff from the True and the False that dominates-and it is almost always asymmetric, with one consequence much bigger than the other, i.e., harboring positive and negative asymmetries (fragile or antifragile). Let me explain.","Suckers try to win arguments, nonsuckers try to win.","You never win an argument until they attack your person.","Probability and expectation are not the same. Its probability and probability times the pay off.","My best definition of a nerd: someone who asks you to explain an aphorism","Never trust a journalist unless she\'s your mother.","Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative.","History doesn\'t crawl; it leaps.","We didn\'t get where we are thanks to the sissy notion of resilience.","Every social association that is not face-to-face is injurious to your health.","People have the problem of denial. This is one of the things I learned in Lebanon. Everybody who left Beirut when the war started, including my parents, said, \'Oh, its temporary.\' It lasted 17 years! People tend to underestimate the gravity of these situations. That\'s how they work.","Don\'t read newspapers for the news (just for the gossip and, of course, profiles of authors). The best filter to know if the news matters is if you hear it in cafes, restaurants... or (again) parties.","A good rule of thumb is as follows: If the numbers come from somebody wearing a tie (Wall Street economist or analyst, industry public relations department, captive think tank academic and so on), you ought to be very skeptical. By design messages from these people are intended to move markets, move merchandise and/or move public policy and are not a comment on the state of the physical universe.","I\'m a private intellectual, not a public one.","But it remains the case that you know what is wrong with a lot more confidence than you know what is right.","Financial institutions have been merging into a smaller number of very large banks. Almost all banks are interrelated. So the financial ecology is swelling into gigantic, incestuous, bureaucratic banks-when one fails, they all fall. We have moved from a diversified ecology of small banks, with varied lending policies, to a more homogeneous framework of firms that all resemble one another. True, we now have fewer failures, but when they occur... I shiver at the thought.","You have family-owned businesses that have been around for 500 years. You cannot name a corporation that survives intact for even a few decades.","Bankers, they\'re not harmed by their mistakes. They benefit when things go right, and the society pays the price.","If I ask you to write down the last 4 digits of your social security number, and then take you out to lunch and ask you how many dentists there are in Manhattan, there\'s going to be a high correlation between those two numbers. What happens is that the number psychologically makes you feel confident.","It\'s not a good idea to take a forecast from someone wearing a tie. If possible, tease people who take themselves and their knowledge too seriously.","What kills me makes others stronger.","A competitive athlete is painful to look at; trying hard to become an animal rather than a man, he will never be as fast as a cheetah or as strong as an ox.","The track record of economists in predicting events is monstrously bad. It is beyond simplification; it is like medieval medicine.","If humans fight the last war, nature fights the next one.","Any system that is deprived of its natural volatility, with government up (unintelligible) volatile, any system becomes very fragile.","The tragedy of virtue is that the more obvious, boring, unoriginal, and sermonizing the proverb, the harder it is to implement.","Private equity has absolutely no reason to exist. The private equity holder has all the upside and the banks all the downside.","The grandchildren should not bear the debts of the grandparents.","Character is proportionate to N, the number of consecutive failures without being discouraged, or equivalently, the number of successive rejections without being intimidated.","Also, it\'s good to have more than one profession, in case your own profession goes out of style. A Wall Street trader who\'s also a belly dancer will do a lot better than a trader who winds up driving a taxi.","Further, in writing, I feel corrupt and unethical if I have to look up a subject in a library as part of the writing itself. This acts as a filter--it is the only filter. If the subject is not interesting enough for me to look it up independently, for my own curiosity or purposes, and I have not done so before, then I should not be writing about it at all, period. It does not mean that libraries (physical and virtual) are not acceptable; it means that they should not be the source of any idea.","Success is becoming in middle adulthood what you dreamed to be in late childhood.","The number of managers with great track records in a given market depends far more on the number of people who started in the investment business (in place of going to dental school), rather than on their ability to produce profits.","I want them poor and they deserve to be poor.

But we have a choice.","Much of the research into humans\' risk-avoidance machinery shows that it is antiquated and unfit for the modern world; it is made to counter repeatable attacks and learn from specifics. If someone narrowly escapes being eaten by a tiger in a certain cave, then he learns to avoid that cave.","Read books are far less valuable than unread ones.","While in theory randomness is an intrinsic property, in practice, randomness is incomplete information.","As countries get rich they start increasing education and the very educated people tend to not like trial and error, because they think they\'re obligated to use the body of knowledge they have.","It\'s harder to say \'no\' when you really mean it.","The opposite of manliness isn\'t cowardice; it\'s technology.","Information is bad for knowledge.","A system, artificially stabilized, and of course you have hidden risks under the surface, and you don\'t know where the risks are.","I\'m a capitalist but one who is smallist and localist, and who favours businesses where owners are still in charge.","Decomposition, for most, starts when they leave the free, social, and uncorrupted college life for the solitary confinement of professions and nuclear families.","Charm is the ability to insult people without offending them; nerdiness the reverse","Being an economist is the least ethical profession, closer to charlatanism than any science.","What we need to do is break the financial community\'s grip on society.","Using, as an excuse, others\' failure of common sense is in itself a failure of common sense.","The payoff of a human venture is, in general, inversely proportional to what it is expected to be.","Economic life should be definancialised.

That\'s the problem. We have too much deficit.

He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with \u201cWow! Signore, professore dottore Eco, what a library you have ! How many of these books have you read? and the others - a very small minority - who get the point that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you don\u2019t know as your financial means, mortgage rates and the currently tight real-estate market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menancingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.\u201d","It has been more profitable for us to bind together in the wrong direction than to be alone in the right one. Those who have followed the assertive idiot rather than the introspective wise person have passed us some of their genes. This is apparent from a social pathology: psychopaths rally followers.","Few understand that procrastination is our natural defense, letting things take care of themselves and exercise their antifragility; it results from some ecological or naturalistic wisdom, and is not always bad -- at an existential level, it is my body rebelling against its entrapment. It is my soul fighting the Procrustean bed of modernity.","Some can be more intelligent than others in a structured environment\u2014in fact school has a selection bias as it favors those quicker in such an environment, and like anything competitive, at the expense of performance outside it. Although I was not yet familiar with gyms, my idea of knowledge was as follows. People who build their strength using these modern expensive gym machines can lift extremely large weights, show great numbers and develop impressive-looking muscles, but fail to lift a stone; they get completely hammered in a street fight by someone trained in more disorderly settings. Their strength is extremely domain-specific and their domain doesn\'t exist outside of ludic\u2014extremely organized\u2014constructs. In fact their strength, as with over-specialized athletes, is the result of a deformity. I thought it was the same with people who were selected for trying to get high grades in a small number of subjects rather than follow their curiosity: try taking them slightly away from what they studied and watch their decomposition, loss of confidence, and denial. (Just like corporate executives are selected for their ability to put up with the boredom of meetings, many of these people were selected for their ability to concentrate on boring material.) I\'ve debated many economists who claim to specialize in risk and probability: when one takes them slightly outside their narrow focus, but within the discipline of probability, they fall apart, with the disconsolate face of a gym rat in front of a gangster hit man.","Difficulty is what wakes up the genius","The minute I was bored with a book or a subject I moved to another one, instead of giving up on reading altogether - when you are limited to the school material and you get bored, you have a tendency to give up and do nothing or play hooky out of discouragement. The trick is to be bored with a specific book, rather than with the act of reading. So the number of the pages absorbed could grow faster than otherwise. And you find gold, so to speak, effortlessly, just as in rational but undirected trial-and-error-based research. It is exactly like options, trial and error, not getting stuck, bifurcating when necessary but keeping a sense of broad freedom and opportunism. Trial and error is freedom.","You may never know what type of person someone is unless they are given opportunities to violate moral or ethical codes.","The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know","I am, at the Fed level, libertarian;at the state level, Republican;at the local level, Democrat;and at the family and friends level, a\\tsocialist.If that saying\\tdoesn\u2019t convince you of the fatuousness\\tof left vs. right labels, nothing will.","The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining than understanding, or better at explaining than doing.","Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. One is capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette - and calling it by some alternative \u201clow risk game.\u201d","Academia is to knowledge what prostitution is to love; close enough on the surface but, to the nonsucker, not exactly the same thing","The biologist and intellectual E. O. Wilson was once asked what represented the most hindrance to the development of children; his answer was the soccer mom. He did not use the notion of the Procrustean bed, but he outlined it perfectly. His argument is that they repress children\'s natural biophilia, their love of living things. But the problem is more general; soccer moms try to eliminate the trial and error, the antifragility, from children\'s lives, move them away from the ecological and transform them into nerds working on preexisting (soccer-mom-compatible) maps of reality. Good students, but nerds--that is, they are like computers except slower. Further, they are now totally untrained to handle ambiguity. As a child of civil war, I disbelieve in structured learning . . . . Provided we have the right type of rigor, we need randomness, mess, adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, near-traumatic episodes, all those things that make life worth living, compared to the structured, fake, and ineffective life of an empty-suit CEO with a preset schedule and an alarm clock.","Abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity.","Further, my characterization of a loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn\u2019t introspect, doesn\u2019t exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on. These types often consider themselves the \u201cvictims of some large plot, a bad boss, or bad weather. Finally, a thought. He who has never sinned is less reliable than he who has only sinned once. And someone who has made plenty of errors\u2014though never the same error more than once\u2014is more reliable than someone who has never made any.\u201d","What matters isn\u2019t what a person has or doesn\u2019t have; it is what he or she is afraid of losing.","Most humans manage to squander their free time, as free time makes them dysfunctional, lazy, and unmotivated\u2014the busier they get, the more active they are at other tasks.","I am most often irritated by those who attack the bishop but somehow fall for the securities analyst--those who exercise their skepticism against religion but not against economists, social scientists, and phony statisticians. Using the confirmation bias, these people will tell you that religion was horrible for mankind by counting deaths from the Inquisition and various religious wars. But they will not show you how many people were killed by nationalism, social science, and political theory under Stalin or during the Vietnam War. Even priests don\'t go to bishops when they feel ill: their first stop is the doctor\'s. But we stop by the offices of many pseudoscientists and \\"experts\\" without alternative. We no longer believe in papal infallibility; we seem to believe in the infallibility of the Nobel, though....","I will repeat the following until I am hoarse: it is contagion that determines the fate of a theory in social science, not its validity.","Categorizing is necessary for humans, but it becomes pathological when the category is seen as definitive, preventing people from considering the fuzziness of boundaries,","I don\u2019t run for trains. Snub your destiny. I have taught myself to resist running to keep on schedule. This may seem a very small piece of advice, but it registered. In refusing to run to catch trains, I have felt the true value of elegance and aesthetics in behavior, a sense of being in control of my time, my schedule, and my life. Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that\u2019s what you are seeking. You stand above the rat race and the pecking order, not outside of it, if you do so by choice.\u201d","If you survive until tomorrow, it could mean that either a) you are more likely to be immortal or b) that you are closer to death.","More data\u2014such as paying attention to the eye colors of the people around when crossing the street\u2014can make you miss the big truck.","Those who talk should do and only those who do should talk.","The simpler, the better. Complications lead to multiplicative chains of unanticipated effects.","The best way to verify that you are alive is by checking if you like variations. Remember that food would not have a taste if it weren\u2019t for hunger; results are meaningless without effort, joy without sadness, convictions without uncertainty, and an ethical life isn\u2019t so when stripped of personal risks.","The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything,","Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty.","No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last word.","Courage is the only virtue you cannot fake.","You can define a free person precisely as someone whose fate is not centrally or directly dependent on peer assessment.","A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in light of the information available until that point","If you want to get an idea of a friend\'s temperament, ethics, and personal elegance, you need to look at him under the tests of severe circumstances, not under the regular rosy glow of daily life.","Work destroys your soul by stealthily invading your brain during the hours not officially spent working; be selective about professions.","Believe me, it is tough to deal with the social consequences of the appearance of continuous failure. We are social animals; hell is other people.","Steve Jobs: \u201cPeople think focus means saying yes to the thing you\u2019ve got to focus on. But that\u2019s not what it means at all.

Train your reasoning abilities to control your decisions; nudge System 1 (the heuristic or experiential system) out of the important ones. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empirical. This insulation from the toxicity of the world will have an additional benefit: it will improve your well-being.","For studying courage in textbooks doesn\u2019t make you any more courageous than eating cow meat makes you bovine. By some mysterious mental mechanism, people fail to realize that the principal thing you can learn from a professor is how to be a professor\u2014and the chief thing you can learn from, say, a life coach or inspirational speaker is how to become a life coach or inspirational speaker. So remember that the heroes of history were not classicists and library rats, those people who live vicariously in their texts.

Life otherwise is not worth living.)","The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. So I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or \u201cincentives for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.\u201d","My dear Socrates\xa0\u2026\xa0you know why they are putting you to death? It is because you make people feel stupid for blindly following habits, instincts, and traditions. You may be occasionally right.

It is not too different from the womanizing popes, such as John XII, or the Borgias. The contradiction can exceed the ludicrous as with French president Fran\xe7ois Mitterrand of France who, coming in on a socialist platform, emulated the pomp of French monarchs.

The second impact becomes more complicated, but possible; you need to be more careful about your knowledge of the initial states, and more precision is called for. The problem is that to correctly predict the ninth impact, you need to take into account the gravitational pull of someone standing next to the table (modestly, Berry\'s computations use a weight of less than 150 pounds).

Note that the same applies to the interpretation of religious texts, often extracted from their broader circumstances.\u201d","Memory is more of a self-serving dynamic revision machine: you remember the last time you remembered the event, and without realizing it, change the story at every subsequent remembrance.","it is impossible for our brain to see anything in raw form without some interpretation. We may not even always be conscious of it.","Imagine taking a test knowing the answer. While we know that history flows forward, it is difficult to realize that we envision it backward. Why is it so? We will discuss the point in Chapter 11 but here is a possible explanation: Our minds are not quite designed to understand how the world works, but, rather, to get out of trouble rapidly and have progeny. If they were made for us to understand things, then we would have a machine in it that would run the past history as in a VCR, with a correct chronology, and it would slow us down so much that we would have trouble operating. Psychologists call this overestimation of what one knew at the time of the event due to subsequent information the hindsight bias, the \u201cI knew it all along effect.\u201d","Amateurs in any discipline are the best, if you can connect with them. Unlike dilettantes, career professionals are to knowledge what prostitutes are to love.","Those who believe in the unconditional benefits of past experience should consider this pearl of wisdom allegedly voiced by a famous ship\u2019s captain: But in all my experience, I have never been in any accident\u2026 of any sort worth speaking about. I have seen but one vessel in distress in all my years at sea. I never saw a wreck and never have been wrecked nor was I ever in any predicament that threatened to end in disaster of any sort. E. J.

The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.","Marketing is bad manners\u2014and I rely on my naturalistic and ecological instincts. Say you run into a person during a boat cruise. What would you do if he started boasting of his accomplishments, telling you how great, rich, tall, impressive, skilled, famous, muscular, well educated, efficient, and good in bed he is, plus other attributes? You would certainly run away (or put him in contact with another talkative bore to get rid of both of them). It is clearly much better if others (preferably someone other than his mother) are the ones saying good things about him, and it would be nice if he acted with some personal humility.","A good book gets better on the second reading. A great book on the third. Any book not worth rereading isn\u2019t worth reading.","To be completely cured of newspapers, spend a year reading the previous week\u2019s newspapers.","It seemed, wrote Machiavelli, that in the midst of murders and civil wars, our republic became stronger [and] its citizens infused with virtues. \u2026 A little bit of agitation gives resources to souls and what makes the species prosper isn\u2019t peace, but freedom.","Alexander the Magnus was once called to solve the following challenge in the Phrygian city of Gordium (as usual with Greek stories, in modern-day Turkey). When he entered Gordium, he found an old wagon, its yoke tied with a multitude of knots, all so tightly entangled that it was impossible to figure out how they were fastened. An oracle had declared that he who would untie the knot would rule all of what was then called \u201cAsia, that is, Asia Minor, the Levant, and the Middle East. After wrestling with the knot, the Magnus drew back from the lump of gnarled ropes, then made a proclamation that it didn\u2019t matter for the prophecy how the tangle was to be unraveled. He then drew his sword and, with a single stroke, cut the knot in half. No \u201csuccessful\u201d academic could ever afford to follow such a policy. And no Intellectual Yet Idiot. It took medicine a long time to realize that when a patient shows up with a headache, it is much better to give him aspirin or recommend a good night\u2019s sleep than do brain surgery, although the latter appears to be more \u201cscientific.\u201d But most \u201cconsultants\u201d and others paid by the hour are not there yet.\u201d","The appearance of busyness reinforces the perception of causality, of the link between results, and one\'s role in them.","Not seeing a tsunami or an economic event coming is excusable; building something fragile to them is not.","A complex system, contrary to what people believe, does not require complicated systems and regulations and intricate policies. The simpler, the better. Complications lead to multiplicative chains of unanticipated effects. Because of opacity, an intervention leads to unforeseen consequences, followed by apologies about the \u201cunforeseen aspect of the consequences, then to another intervention to correct the secondary effects, leading to an explosive series of branching \u201cunforeseen\u201d responses, each one worse than the preceding one. Yet simplicity has been difficult to implement in modern life because it is against the spirit of a certain brand of people who seek sophistication so they can justify their profession.\u201d","we have evidence that collectively society doesn\u2019t advance with organized education, rather the reverse: the level of (formal) education in a country is the result of wealth.","We humans are not just a superficial race (this may be curable to some extent); we are a very unfair one.","A half-man (or, rather, half-person) is not someone who does not have an opinion, just someone who does not take risks for it.","The true hero in the Black Swan world is someone who prevents a calamity and, naturally, because the calamity did not take place, does not get recognition\u2014or a bonus\u2014for it. I will be taking the concept deeper in Book VII, on ethics, about the unfairness of a bonus system and how such unfairness is magnified by complexity.","This confirmation problem pervades our modern life, since most conflicts have at their root the following mental bias: when Arabs and Israelis watch news reports they see different stories in the same succession of events. Likewise, Democrats and Republicans look at different parts of the same data and never converge to the same opinions. Once your mind is inhabited with a certain view of the world, you will tend to only consider instances proving you to be right. Paradoxically, the more information you have, the more justified you will feel in your views.","No, businessmen as risk takers are not subjected to the judgment of other businessmen, only to that of their personal accountant.","Technology is the result of antifragility, exploited by risk-takers in the form of tinkering and trial and error, with nerd-driven design confined to the backstage.","Almost everything in social life is produced by rare but consequential shocks and jumps; all the while almost everything studied about social life focuses on the \u201cnormal, particularly with \u201cbell curve\u201d methods of inference that tell you close to nothing.

And","Yes, an intolerant minority can control and destroy democracy. Actually, it will eventually destroy our world. So, we need to be more than intolerant with some intolerant minorities. Simply, they violate the Silver Rule. It is not permissible to use \u201cAmerican values or \u201cWestern principles\u201d in treating intolerant Salafism (which denies other peoples\u2019 right to have their own religion). The West is currently in the process of committing suicide.\u201d","Perhaps the wise one is the one who knows that he cannot see things far away.","This, perhaps is true self-confidence: the ability to look at the world without the need to find signs that stroke one\'s ego.","In spite of what is studied in business schools concerning \u201ceconomies of scale, size hurts you at times of stress; it is not a good idea to be large during difficult times.\u201d","If your private life conflicts with your intellectual opinion, it cancels your intellectual ideas, not your private life.","Take the following potent and less-is-more-style argument by the rogue economist Ha-Joon Chang. In 1960 Taiwan had a much lower literacy rate than the Philippines and half the income per person; today Taiwan has ten times the income. At the same time, Korea had a much lower literacy rate than Argentina (which had one of the highest in the world) and about one-fifth the income per person; today it has three times as much. Further, over the same period, sub-Saharan Africa saw markedly increasing literacy rates, accompanied with a decrease in their standard of living. We can multiply the examples (Pritchet\u2019s study is quite thorough), but I wonder why people don\u2019t realize the simple truism, that is, the fooled by randomness effect: mistaking the merely associative for the causal, that is, if rich countries are educated, immediately inferring that education makes a country rich, without even checking. Epiphenomenon here again.","A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of the information until that point","The psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer has a simple heuristic. Never ask the doctor what you should do. Ask him what he would do if he were in your place. You would be surprised at the difference.","there is something in nature you don\u2019t understand, odds are it makes sense in a deeper way that is beyond your understanding.","I have called this mental defect the Lucretius problem, after the Latin poetic philosopher who wrote that the fool believes that the tallest mountain in the world will be equal to the tallest one he has observed. We consider the biggest object of any kind that we have seen in our lives or hear about as the largest item that can possibly exist. And we have been doing this for millenia. In Pharaonic Egypt, which happens to be the first complete top-down nation-state managed by bureaucrats, scribes tracked the high-water mark of the Nile and used it as an estimate for a future worst-case scenario.The same can be seen in the Fukushima nuclear reactor, which experienced a catastrophic failure in 2011 when a tsunami struck. It had been built to withstand the worst past historical earthquake, with the builders not imagining much worse--and not thinking that the worst past event had to be a surprise, as it had no precedent. Likewise, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Fragilista Doctor Alan Greenspan, in his apology to Congress offered the classic \\"It never happened before.\\" Well, nature, unlike Fragilista Greenspan, prepares for what has not happened before, assuming worse harm is possible.","Because what matters in life isn\u2019t how frequently one is \u201cright about outcomes, but how much one makes when one is right. Being wrong, when it is not costly, doesn\u2019t count\u2014in a way that\u2019s similar to trial-and-error mechanisms of research.\u201d","Information is antifragile; it feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it. For instance, many wreck their reputations merely by trying to defend them.","Organisms need, to use the metaphor of Marcus Aurelius, to turn obstacles into fuel\u2014just as fire does.","This high-yield market resembles a nap on a railway track.","an ad hominen attack against an intellectual, not against an idea, is highly flattering. It indicates that the person does not have anything intelligent to say about your message.","The ethical is always more robust than the legal. Over time, it is the legal that should converge to the ethical, never the reverse.","Freedom is always associated with risk taking, whether it leads to it or comes from it.","Thirty-nine percent of Americans will spend a year in the top 5 percent of the income distribution, 56 percent will find themselves in the top 10 percent, and 73 percent will spend a year in the top 20 percent.","The hippocampus is the structure where memory is supposedly controlled. It is the most plastic part of the brain; it is also the part that is assumed to absorb all the damage from repeated insults like the chronic stress we experience daily from small doses of negative feelings\u2014as opposed to the invigorating \u201cgood stress of the tiger popping up occasionally in your living room. You can rationalize all you want; the hippocampus takes the insult of chronic stress seriously, incurring irreversible atrophy. Contrary to popular belief, these small, seemingly harmless stressors do not strengthen you; they can amputate part of your self.\u201d","People often need to suspend their self-promotion, and have someone in their lives they do not need to impress. This explains dog ownership.","Learning is rooted in repetition and convexity, meaning that the reading of a single text twice is more profitable than reading two different things once.","Beyond our perceptional distortions, there is a problem with logic itself. How can someone have no clue yet be able to hold a set of perfectly sound and coherent viewpoints that match the observations and abide by every single possible rule of logic? Consider that two people can hold incompatible beliefs based on the exact same data. Does this mean that there are possible families of explanations and that each of these can be equally perfect and sound? Certainly not. One may have a million ways to explain things, but the true explanation is unique, whether or not it is within our reach.","Whenever you hear a snotty (and frustrated) European middlebrow presenting his stereotypes about Americans, he will often describe them as \u201cuncultured, \u201cunintellectual,\u201d and \u201cpoor in math\u201d because, unlike his peers, Americans are not into equation drills and the constructions middlebrows call \u201chigh culture\u201d\u2014like knowledge of Goethe\u2019s inspirational (and central) trip to Italy, or familiarity with the Delft school of painting. Yet the person making these statements is likely to be addicted to his iPod, wear blue jeans, and use Microsoft Word to jot down his \u201ccultural\u201d statements on his PC, with some Google searches here and there interrupting his composition. Well, it so happens that America is currently far, far more creative than these nations of museumgoers and equation solvers. It is also far more tolerant of bottom-up tinkering and undirected trial and error. And globalization has allowed the United States to specialize in the creative aspect of things, the production of concepts and ideas, that is, the scalable part of the products, and, increasingly, by exporting jobs, separate the less scalable components and assign them to those happy to be paid by the hour. There\u201d","There are designations, like \u201ceconomist, \u201cprostitute,\u201d or \u201cconsultant,\u201d for which additional characterization doesn\u2019t add information.\u201d","Religion isn\u2019t so much about telling man that there is one God as about preventing man from thinking that he is God.","I discovered that it is much more effective to act like a nice guy and be \\"reasonable\\" if you prove willing to go beyond just verbiage. You can afford to be compassionate, lax, and courteous if, once in a while, when it is least expected of you, but completely justified, you sue someone, or savage an enemy, just to show that you can walk the walk.","What made medicine fool people for so long was that its successes were prominently displayed and its mistakes (literally) buried.","Robust is when you care more about the few who like your work than the multitude who dislike it (artists); fragile when you care more about the few who dislike your work than the multitude who like it (politicians).","Few understand that procrastination is our natural defense, letting things take care of themselves","Prediction requires knowing about technologies that will be discovered in the future. But that very knowledge would almost automatically allow us to start developing those technologies right away. Ergo, we do not know what we will know.","Criticism, for a book, is a truthful, unfaked badge of attention, signaling that it is not boring; and boring is the only very bad thing for a book. Consider the Ayn Rand phenomenon: her books Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead have been read for more than half a century by millions of people, in spite of, or most likely thanks to, brutally nasty reviews and attempts to discredit her. The first-order information is the intensity: what matters is the effort the critic puts into trying to prevent others from reading the book, or, more generally in life, it is the effort in badmouthing someone that matters, not so much what is said. So if you really want people to read a book, tell them it is \u201coverrated, with a sense of outrage (and use the attribute \u201cunderrated\u201d for the opposite effect).\u201d","A BS DETECTION HEURISTIC The heuristic here would be to use education in reverse: hire, conditional on an equal set of skills, the person with the least label-oriented education. It means that the person had to succeed in spite of the credentialization of his competitors and overcome more serious hurdles. In addition, people who didn\u2019t go to Harvard are easier to deal with in real life.","For if you think that education causes wealth, rather than being a result of wealth, or that intelligent actions and discoveries are the result of intelligent ideas, you will be in for a surprise. Let us see what kind of surprise.","No muscles without strength, friendship without trust, opinion without consequence, change without aesthetics, age without values, life without effort, water without thirst, food without nourishment, love without sacrifice, power without fairness, facts without rigor, statistics without logic, mathematics without proof, teaching without experience, politeness without warmth, values without embodiment, degrees without erudition, militarism without fortitude, progress without civilization, friendship without investment, virtue without risk, probability without ergodicity, wealth without exposure, complication without depth, fluency without content, decision without asymmetry, science without skepticism, religion without tolerance, and, most of all: nothing without skin in the game.","My experience is that money and transactions purify relations; ideas and abstract matters like \\"recognition\\" and \\"credit\\" warp them, creating an atmosphere of perpetual rivalry.","It is just that narrative can be lethal when used in the wrong places.","We have managed to transfer religious belief into gullibility for whatever can masquerade as science.","It is the system and its fragility, not events, that must be studied\u2014what","Mother Nature does not develop Alzheimer\u2019s\u2014actually there is evidence that even humans would not easily lose brain function with age if they followed a regimen of stochastic exercise and stochastic fasting, took long walks, avoided sugar, bread, white rice, and stock market investments, and refrained from taking economics classes or reading such things as The New York Times.","Technology can degrade (and endanger) every aspect of a sucker\u2019s life while convincing him that it is becoming more \u201cefficient. - The difference between technology and slavery is that slaves are fully aware that they are not free. - You have a real life if and only if you do not compete with anyone in any of your pursuits. - With terminal disease, nature lets you die with abbreviated suffering; medicine lets you suffer with prolonged dying. -\u201d","A turkey is fed for a thousand days by a butcher; every day confirms to its staff of analysts that butchers love turkeys \u201cwith increased statistical confidence.","And, talking about radiation, few wonder why, after hundreds of million of years of having our skins exposed to sun rays, we suddenly need so much protection from them\u2014is it that our exposure is more harmful than before because of changes in the atmosphere, or populations living in an environment mismatching the pigmentation of their skin\u2014or rather, that makers of sun protection products need to make some profits?","Alas, one cannot assert authority by accepting one\'s own fallibility. Simply, people need to be blinded by knowledge-we are made to follow leaders who can gather people together because the advantages of being in groups trump the disadvantages of being alone. It has been more profitable for us to bind together in the wrong direction than to be alone in the right one. Those who have followed the assertive idiot rather than the introspective wise person have passed us some of their genes. This is apparent from a social pathology: psychopaths rally followers.","But things are even worse: in real life, every single bit of risk you take adds up to reduce your life expectancy. If you climb mountains and ride a motorcycle and hang around the mob and fly your own small plane and drink absinthe, and smoke cigarettes, and play parkour on Thursday night, your life expectancy is considerably reduced, although no single action will have a meaningful effect. This idea of repetition makes paranoia about some low-probability events, even that deemed \u201cpathological, perfectly rational.\u201d","We see the obvious and visible consequences, not the invisible and less obvious ones. Yet those unseen consequences.., generally are more meaningful.","Popper introduced the mechanism of conjectures and refutations, which works as follows: you formulate a (bold) conjecture and you start looking for the observation that would prove you wrong.","I discovered that I had been intuitively using the less-is-more idea as an aid in decision making (contrary to the method of putting a series of pros and cons side by side on a computer screen). For instance, if you have more than one reason to do something (choose a doctor or veterinarian, hire a gardener or an employee, marry a person, go on a trip), just don\u2019t do it. It does not mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more than one reason you are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason. Likewise the French army had a heuristic to reject excuses for absenteeism for more than one reason, like death of grandmother, cold virus, and being bitten by a boar. If someone attacks a book or idea using more than one argument, you know it is not real: nobody says \u201che is a criminal, he killed many people, and he also has bad table manners and bad breath and is a very poor driver.","Assume that you live in a town with two hospitals\u2014one large, the other small. On a given day 60 percent of those born in one of the two hospitals are boys. Which hospital is it likely to be?","Most people fear being without audiovisual stimulation because they are too repetitive when they think and imagine things on their own.","In the old days, privilege came with obligations\u2014except for the small class of intellectuals who served a patron or, in some cases, the state. You want to be a feudal lord\u2014you will be first to die. You want war? First in battle. Let us not forget something embedded in the U.S. Constitution: the president is commander in chief. Caesar, Alexander, and Hannibal were on the battlefield\u2014the last, according to Livy, was first-in, last-out of combat zones. George Washington, too, went to battle, unlike Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, who played video games while threatening the lives of others.","It is far easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it.","randomness in the end is just unknowledge. the world is opaque and appearances fool us","Some business bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them and if you have the personal and intellectual stamina.","we are not made to view things as independent from each other. When viewing two events A and B, it is hard not to assume that A causes B, B causes A, or both cause each other. Our bias is immediately to establish a causal link.","Under opacity and in the newfound complexity of the world, people can hide risks and hurt others, with the law incapable of catching them. Iatrogenics has both delayed and invisible consequences. It is hard to see causal links, to fully understand what\u2019s going on. Under such epistemic limitations, skin in the game is the only true mitigator of fragility.","Almost everything in social life is produced by rare but consequential shocks and jumps; all the while almost everything studied about social life focuses on the \\"normal,\\" particularly with \\"bell curve\\" methods of inference that tell you close to nothing. Why? Because the bell curve ignores large deviations, cannot handle them, yet makes us confident that we have tamed uncertainty.

Just as one day some primitive tribesman scratched his nose, saw rain falling, and developed an elaborate method of scratching his nose to bring on the much-needed rain, we link economic prosperity to some rate cut by the Federal Reserve Board, or the success of a company with the appointment of the new president \u201cat the helm.","Breaking a fast feels like the exact opposite of a hangover.","Recall the confirmation fallacy: governments are great at telling you what they did, but not what they did not do. In fact, they engage in what could be labeled as phony \u201cphilanthropy, the activity of helping people in a visible and sensational way without taking into account the unseen cemetery of invisible consequences. Bastiat inspired libertarians by attacking the usual arguments that showed the benefits of governments. But his ideas can be generalized to apply to both the Right and the Left.\u201d","Wind extinguishes a candle and energizes fire.

Yet there is no evidence that strategic planning works\u2014we even seem to have evidence against it.

Anyone looking for confirmation will find enough of it to deceive himself--and no doubt his peers.* The Black Swan idea is based on the structure of randomness in empirical reality.*It is also na\xefve empiricism to provide, in support of some argument, series of eloquent confirmatory quotes by dead authorities. By searching, you can always find someone who made a well-sounding statement that confirms your point of view--and, on every topic, it is possible to find another dead thinker who said the exact opposite. Almost all my non Yogi Berra quotes are from people I disagree with.","One single observation can invalidate a general statement derived from millennia of confirmatory sightings of millions of white swans. All you need is one single (and, I am told, quite ugly) black bird.*","Now take a look at the cemetery. It is quite difficult to do so because people who fail do not seem to write memoirs, and, if they did, those business publishers I know would not even consider giving them the courtesy of a returned phone call (as to returned e-mail, fuhgedit). Readers would not pay $26.95 for a story of failure, even if you convinced them that it had more useful tricks than a story of success.* The entire notion of biography is grounded in the arbitrary ascription of a causal relation between specified traits and subsequent events. Now consider the cemetery. The graveyard of failed persons will be full of people who shared the following traits: courage, risk taking, optimism, et cetera. Just like the population of millionaires. There may be some differences in skills, but what truly separates the two is for the most part a single factor: luck. Plain luck.","People feel deep anxiety finding out that someone they thought was stupid is actually more intelligent than they are.","One conceivable way to discriminate between a scientific intellectual and a literary intellectual is by considering that a scientific intellectual can usually recognize the writing of another but that the literary intellectual would not be able to tell the difference between lines jotted down by a scientist and those by a glib nonscientist. This is even more apparent when the literary intellectual starts using scientific buzzwords, like \u201cuncertainty principle, \u201cGodel\u2019s theorem,\u201d \u201cparallel universe,\u201d or \u201crelativity,\u201d either out of context or, as often, in exact opposition to the scientific meaning.

You seek a romantic moment and what you get is cancer.","So let us call here the teleological fallacy the illusion that you know exactly where you are going, and that you knew exactly where you were going in the past, and that others have succeeded in the past by knowing where they were going.","An honest person will never commit criminal acts, but a criminal will readily engage in legal acts.","Give me a few lines written by any man and I will find enough to get him hung goes the saying attributed to Richelieu, Voltaire, Talleyrand (a vicious censor during the French revolution phase of terror), and a few others.\u201d","They will envy you for your success, for your wealth, for your intelligence, for your looks, for your status\u2014but rarely for your wisdom.","Someone who has been employed for a while is giving you strong evidence of submission.","Humans somehow fail to recognize situations outside the contexts in which they usually learn about them.","in Ovid, difficulty is what wakes up the genius (ingenium mala saepe movent),","We can get closer to the truth by negative instances, not by verification!

We are witnessing the rise of a new class of inverse heroes, that is, bureaucrats, bankers, Davos-attending members of the I.A.N.D.

This explains why these scientists attributed their failures to the \u201cten sigma rare event, indicative of the thought that they were right but that luck played against them. Why? It is a human heuristic that makes us actually believe so in order not to kill our self-esteem and keep us going against adversity.\u201d","Every time you use a coffeemaker for your morning cappuccino, you are benefiting from the fragility of the coffeemaking entrepreneur who failed. He failed in order to help put the superior merchandise on your kitchen counter.","We laugh at others and we don\'t realize that someone will be just as justified in laughing at us on some not too remote day","Those who use foul language on social networks (such as Twitter) are sending an expensive signal that they are free\u2014and, ironically, competent. You don\u2019t signal competence if you don\u2019t take risks for it\u2014there are few such low-risk strategies.

There is no word for it in Romance languages; in Arabic it is called Shhm\u2014best translated as nonsmall. If you take risks and face your fate with dignity, there is nothing you can do that makes you small; if you don\u2019t take risks, there is nothing you can do that makes you grand, nothing.\u201d","The way to avoid the ills of the narrative fallacy is to favor experimentation over storytelling, experience over history, and clinical knowledge over theories. Certainly","The story of the wheel also illustrates the point of this chapter: both governments and universities have done very, very little for innovation and discovery, precisely because, in addition to their blinding rationalism, they look for the complicated, the lurid, the newsworthy, the narrated, the scientistic, and the grandiose, rarely for the wheel on the suitcase. Simplicity, I realized, does not lead to laurels.","In practice, randomness is fundamentally incomplete information.","Another way to view it: the iatrogenics is in the patient, not in the treatment. If the patient is close to death, all speculative treatments should be encouraged\u2014no holds barred. Conversely, if the patient is near healthy, then Mother Nature should be the doctor.","The only valid political system is one that can handle an imbecile in power without suffering from it.","Finally, I reckon that I am not immune to such an emotional defect. But I deal with it by having no access to information, except in rare circumstances. Again, I prefer to read poetry. If an event is important enough, it will find its way to my ears. I will return to this point in time.","Consider a more extreme example than the casino experiment. Assume a collection of people play Russian roulette a single time for a million dollars\u2014this is the central story in Fooled by Randomness. About five out of six will make money. If someone used a standard cost-benefit analysis, he would have claimed that one has an 83.33 percent chance of gains, for an \u201cexpected average return per shot of $833,333.

Besides, I believe that I need my emotions to formulate my ideas and get the energy to execute them. I am just intelligent enough to understand that I have a predisposition to be fooled by randomness\u2014and to accept the fact that I am rather emotional. I am dominated by my emotions\u2014but as an aesthete, I am happy about that fact. I am just like every single character whom I ridiculed in this book. Not only that, but I may be even worse than them because there may be a negative correlation between beliefs and behavior (recall Popper the man). The difference between me and those I ridicule is that I try to be aware of it. No matter how long I study and try to understand probability, my emotions will respond to a different set of calculations, those that my unintelligent genes want me to handle. If my brain can tell the difference between noise and signal, my heart cannot. Such unintelligent behavior does not just cover probability and randomness. I do not think I am reasonable enough to avoid getting angry when a discourteous driver blows his horn at me for being one nanosecond late after a traffic light turns green. I am fully aware that such anger is self-destructive and offers no benefit, and that if I were to develop anger for every idiot around me doing something of the sort, I would be long dead. These small daily emotions are not rational. But we need them to function properly. We are designed to respond to hostility with hostility. I have enough enemies to add some spice to my life, but I sometimes wish I had a few more (I rarely go to the movies and need the entertainment).

In a nutshell we think that we would know when history is made; we believe that people who, say, witnessed the stock market crash of 1929 knew then that they lived an acute historical event and that, should these events repeat themselves, they too would know about such facts. Life for us is made to resemble an adventure movie, as we know ahead of time that something big is about to happen. It is hard to imagine that people who witnessed history did not know at the time how important the moment was. Somehow all respect we may have for history does not translate well into our treatment of the present.","Things are always obvious after the fact.

Even the initial referee of the scientific article I wrote on defining and detecting antifragility entirely missed the point, conflating antifragility and robustness\u2014and that was the scientist who pored over my definitions. It is worth re-explaining the following: the robust or resilient is neither harmed nor helped by volatility and disorder, while the antifragile benefits from them.

This implies the need to use the extreme event as a starting point and not treat it as an exception to be pushed under the rug.

We shall see how you can verify, even measure, such arrogance in your own living room. Second, we will look at the implications of this arrogance for all the activities involving prediction. Why on earth do we predict so much? Worse, even, and more interesting: Why don\u2019t we talk about our record in predicting? Why don\u2019t we see how we (almost) always miss the big events?

On paper, the frequency of being right matters, but only on paper\u2014typically, fragile payoffs have little (sometimes no) upside, and antifragile payoffs have little downside. This means that one makes pennies to lose dollars in the fragile case; makes dollars to lose pennies in the antifragile one. So the antifragile can lose for a long time with impunity, so long as he happens to be right once; for the fragile, a single loss can be terminal. Accordingly if you were betting on the downfall of, say, a portfolio of financial institutions because of their fragilities, it would have cost you pennies over the years preceding their eventual demise in 2008, as Nero and Tony did. (Note again that taking the other side of fragility makes you antifragile.) You were wrong for years, right for a moment, losing small, winning big, so vastly more successful than the other way (actually the other way would be bust). So you would have made the Thekels like Thales because betting against the fragile is antifragile. But someone who had merely \u201cpredicted the event with just words would have been called by the journalists \u201cwrong for years,\u201d \u201cwrong most of the time,\u201d etc. Should we keep tally of opinion makers\u2019 \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong,\u201d the proportion does not matter, as we need to include consequences.

I immediately thought that perhaps the opposite parable should be written: instead of having the rulers randomize the jobs of citizens, we should have citizens randomize the jobs of rulers, naming them by raffles and removing them at random as well.

When you have skin in the game, dull things like checking the safety of the aircraft because you may be forced to be a passenger in it cease to be boring. If you are an investor in a company, doing ultra-boring things like reading the footnotes of a financial statement (where the real information is to be found) becomes, well, almost not boring. But there is an even more vital dimension. Many addicts who normally have a dull intellect and the mental nimbleness of a cauliflower\u2014or a foreign policy expert\u2014are capable of the most ingenious tricks to procure their drugs.

But, to no avail. Without the addiction, their miraculous powers go away. It was like a magical potion that gave remarkable powers to those seeking it, but not those drinking it. A confession. When I don\u2019t have skin in the game, I am usually dumb. My knowledge of technical matters, such as risk and probability, did not initially come from books. It did not come from lofty philosophizing and scientific hunger. It did not even come from curiosity. It came from the thrills and hormonal flush one gets while taking risks in the markets. I never thought mathematics was something interesting to me until, when I was at Wharton, a friend told me about the financial options I described earlier (and their generalization, complex derivatives). I immediately decided to make a career in them. It was a combination of financial trading and complicated probability. The field was new and uncharted. I knew in my guts there were mistakes in the theories that used the conventional bell curve and ignored the impact of the tails (extreme events). I knew in my guts that academics had not the slightest clue about the risks. So, to find errors in the estimation of these probabilistic securities, I had to study probability, which mysteriously and instantly became fun, even gripping. When there was risk on the line, suddenly a second brain in me manifested itself, and the probabilities of intricate sequences became suddenly effortless to analyze and map. When there is fire, you will run faster than in any competition. When you ski downhill some movements become effortless. Then I became dumb again when there was no real action. Furthermore, as traders the mathematics we used fit our problem like a glove, unlike academics with a theory looking for some application\u2014in some cases we had to invent models out of thin air and could not afford the wrong equations. Applying math to practical problems was another business altogether; it meant a deep understanding of the problem before writing the equations.","via negativa (acting by removing) is more powerful and less error-prone than via positiva (acting by addition","Not only is it difficult for the journalist to think more like a historian, but it is, alas, the historian who is becoming more like the journalist.","Reverse-engineering problem: It is easier to predict how an ice cube would melt into a puddle than, looking at a puddle, to guess the shape of the ice cube that may have caused it.

Collectively, farmers as a community prefer to avoid overgrazing, and fishermen overfishing\u2014the entire resource becomes thus degraded. But every single individual farmer would personally gain from his own overgrazing or overfishing under, of course, the condition that others don\u2019t. And that is what plagues socialism: people\u2019s individual interests do not quite work well under collectivism. But it is a critical mistake to think that people can function only under a private property system. What Ostrom found empirically is that there exists a certain community size below which people act as collectivists, protecting the commons, as if the entire unit became rational. Such a commons cannot be too large. It is like a club. Groups behave differently at a different scale.

(And, of course, to remind the reader of cherry-picking, we need to take into account the body of theoretical knowledge that went nowhere.) But at first, nobody had an idea what to do with these enormous boxes full of circuits as they were cumbersome, expensive, and their applications were not too widespread, outside of database management, only good to process quantities of data. It is as if one needed to invent an application for the thrill of technology. Baby boomers will remember those mysterious punch cards. Then someone introduced the console to input with the aid of a screen monitor, using a keyboard. This led, of course, to word processing, and the computer took off because of its fitness to word processing, particularly with the microcomputer in the early 1980s. It was convenient, but not much more than that until some other unintended consequence came to be mixed into it. Now Phase Two, the Internet. It had been set up as a resilient military communication network device, developed by a research unit of the Department of Defense called DARPA and got a boost in the days when Ronald Reagan was obsessed with the Soviets. It was meant to allow the United States to survive a generalized military attack.

But when they have big bucks they end up pressured to move into outsized, impersonal, and silent mansions, far away from neighbors. On late afternoons, the silence of these large galleries has a funereal feel to it, but without the soothing music. This is something historically rare: in the past, large mansions were teeming with servants, head-servants, butlers, cooks, assistants, maids, private tutors, impoverished cousins, horse grooms, even personal musicians. And nobody today will come to console you for having a mansion\u2014few will realize that it is quite sad to be there on Sunday evening.","Besides narrative and causality, journalists and public intellectuals of the sound-bite variety do not make the world simpler.

But this argument was not quite the entire reason for my dictum in this book to avoid the newspapers, as we will see further benefits in avoiding the toxicity of information.

We humans live too long for researchers to test if such restriction increases our life expectancy (if the hypothesis is true, then the subjects of the test would outlive the researchers). But it looks like such restriction makes humans healthier (and may also improve their sense of humor). But since abundance would bring the opposite effect, this episodic caloric restriction can be also interpreted as follows: too much regular food is bad for you, and depriving humans of the stressor of hunger may make them live less than their full potential; so all hormesis seems to be doing is reestablishing the natural dosage for food and hunger in humans. In other words, hormesis is the norm, and its absence is what hurts us.","But simplicity is not so simple to attain.

Merton showed that many academics cite references without having read the original work; rather, they\u2019ll read a paper and draw their own citations from among its sources. So a third researcher reading the second article selects three of the previously referenced authors for his citations. These three authors will receive cumulatively more and more attention as their names become associated more tightly with the subject at hand.

The same optical illusion prevails: those who start gambling will be either lucky or unlucky (given that the casino has the advantage, a slightly greater number will be unlucky). The lucky ones, with the feeling of having been selected by destiny, will continue gambling; the others, discouraged, will stop and will not show up in the sample.

To this day Romance languages use the expression \u201crich as Croesus to describe a person of excessive wealth. He was said to be visited by Solon, the Greek legislator known for his dignity, reserve, upright morals, humility, frugality, wisdom, intelligence, and courage. Solon did not display the smallest surprise at the wealth and splendor surrounding his host, nor the tiniest admiration for their owner. Croesus was so irked by the manifest lack of impression on the part of this illustrious visitor that he attempted to extract from him some acknowledgment. He asked him if he had known a happier man than him. Solon cited the life of a man who led a noble existence and died while in battle. Prodded for more, he gave similar examples of heroic but terminated lives, until Croesus, irate, asked him point-blank if he was not to be considered the happiest man of all. Solon answered: \u201cThe observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man\u2019s happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has [guaranteed] continued happiness until the end we may call happy.\u201d The modern equivalent has been no less eloquently voiced by the baseball coach Yogi Berra, who seems to have translated Solon\u2019s outburst from the pure Attic Greek into no less pure Brooklyn English with \u201cit ain\u2019t over until it\u2019s over,\u201d or, in a less dignified manner, with \u201cit ain\u2019t over until the fat lady sings.\u201d","While Nero had become inured to the sight of traders getting rich (and trying too hard to become sophisticated by turning into wine collectors and opera lovers), his wife had rarely encountered repressed new wealth\u2014the type of people who have felt the sting of indigence at some point in their lives and want to get even by exhibiting their wares.

Further, an optical illusion comes with the dominance of the minority: a naive observer (who looks at the standard average) would be under the impression that the choices and preferences are those of the majority.

The chief ethical rule is the following: Thou shalt not have antifragility at the expense of the fragility of others.","...this evolution is not a competition between ideas, but between humans and systems based on such ideas.

A friend of mine built himself a very secure profession as a book editor, in which he was known to be very good. Then, after a decade or so, he left completely for something speculative and highly risky. This is a true barbell in every sense of the word: he can fall back on his previous profession should the speculation fail, or fail to bring the expected satisfaction. This is what Seneca elected to do: he initially had a very active, adventurous life, followed by a philosophical withdrawal to write and meditate, rather than a \u201cmiddle combination of both. Many of the \u201cdoers\u201d turned \u201cthinkers\u201d like Montaigne have done a serial barbell: pure action, then pure reflection.\u201d","On the left, in the fragile category, the mistakes are rare and large when they occur, hence irreversible; to the right the mistakes are small and benign, even reversible and quickly overcome.

I use the example as computed by the mathematician Michael Berry. If you know a set of basic parameters concerning the ball at rest, can compute the resistance of the table (quite elementary), and can gauge the strength of the impact, then it is rather easy to predict what would happen at the first hit. The second impact becomes more complicated, but possible; you need to be more careful about your knowledge of the initial states, and more precision is called for. The problem is that to correctly compute the ninth impact, you need to take into account the gravitational pull of someone standing next to the table (modestly, Berry\u2019s computations use a weight of less than 150 pounds). And to compute the fifty-sixth impact, every single elementary particle of the universe needs to be present in your assumptions!","pi\xf9 la risposta \xe8 non lineare, meno rilevante \xe8 la media e pi\xf9 importante \xe8 la stabilit\xe0 intorno a questa media.","One learns new words without making a nerd-effort, but rather another type of effort: to communicate, mostly by being forced to read the mind of the other person - suspending ones fear of making mistakes.","Platonicity is what makes us think that we understand more than we actually do. But this does not happen everywhere. I am not saying that Platonic forms don\u2019t exist. Models and constructions, these intellectual maps of reality, are not always wrong; they are wrong only in some specific applications. The difficulty is that a) you do not know beforehand (only after the fact) where the map will be wrong, and b) the mistakes can lead to severe consequences. These models are like potentially helpful medicines that carry random but very severe side effects.","don\u2019t need much help from fate to get larger-scale entertainment: reality provides such forced revisions of beliefs at quite a high frequency.","Contrary to conventional wisdom, our body of knowledge does not increase from a series of confirmatory observations, like","anything locked into planning tends to fail precisely because of these attributes\u2014it is quite a myth that planning helps corporations: in fact we saw that the world is too random and unpredictable to base a policy on visibility of the future.

Our ingratitude toward the po\xe8tes maudits fades completely in front of this other type of thanklessness. This is a far more vicious kind of ingratitude: the feeling of uselessness on the part of the silent hero. I will illustrate with the following thought experiment. Assume that a legislator with courage, influence, intellect, vision, and perseverance manages to enact a law that goes into universal effect and employment on September 10, 2001; it imposes the continuously locked bulletproof doors in every cockpit (at high costs to the struggling airlines)\u2014just in case terrorists decide to use planes to attack the World Trade Center in New York City. I know this is lunacy, but it is just a thought experiment (I am aware that there may be no such thing as a legislator with intellect, courage, vision, and perseverance; this is the point of the thought experiment). The legislation is not a popular measure among the airline personnel, as it complicates their lives. But it would certainly have prevented 9/11. The person who imposed locks on cockpit doors gets no statues in public squares, not so much as a quick mention of his contribution in his obituary. \u201cJoe Smith, who helped avoid the disaster of 9/11, died of complications of liver disease. Seeing how superfluous his measure was, and how it squandered resources, the public, with great help from airline pilots, might well boot him out of office. Vox clamantis in deserto.
