Your character traits are a kind of chemical mix that will never be repeated in history. There are ideas unique to you, a specific rhythm and perspective that are your strengths, not your weaknesses. You must not be afraid of your uniqueness and you must care less and less what people think of you.","Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of others\u2014that is too high a price to pay.","Understand: people will constantly attack you in life. One of their main weapons will be to instill in you doubts about yourself \u2013 your worth, your abilities, your potential. They will often disguise this as their objective opinion, but invariably it has a political purpose \u2013 they want to keep you down.","True genius, in strategy or anywhere, lies in self-control, self-mastery, presence of mind, fluidity of thought.","No moment is wasted if you pay attention and learn the lessons contained in every experience.","The world wants to assign you a role in life. And once you accept that role you are doomed.","I believe that everything happens for a reason, and what seems bad at first might in fact be something of a blessing.","Win through your actions, never through argument.","The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.","Think of it this way: There are two kinds of failure. The first comes from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid, or because you are waiting for the perfect time. This kind of failure you can never learn from, and such timidity will destroy you. The second kind comes from a bold and venturesome spirit. If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your reputation is greatly outweighed by what you learn. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done.","Mastery is not a function of genius or talent. It is a function of time and intense focus applied to a particular field of knowledge.","People around you, constantly under the pull of their emotions, change their ideas by the day or by the hour, depending on their mood. You must never assume that what people say or do in a particular moment is a statement of their permanent desires.","You have the power to think differently about who you are. You have the ability to turn off the critical voice inside of you. That\'s not you. That\'s coming from the culture. That\'s coming from the outside of you. You\'ve internalized the voice of your parents, your teachers, your friends.","You can die from someone else\'s misery \u2014 emotional states are as infectious as diseases. You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.","Never assume that the person you are dealing with is weaker or less important than you are. Some people are slow to take offense, which may make you misjudge the thickness of their skin, and fail to worry about insulting them. But should you offend their honor and their pride, they will overwhelm you with a violence that seems sudden and extreme given their slowness to anger. If you want to turn people down, it is best to do so politely and respectfully, even if you feel their request is impudent or their offer ridiculous.","Your unhappiness is a way of speaking to you, it\'s telling you something isn\'t right.","Never whine, never complain, never try to justify yourself.","When our emotions are engaged, we often have trouble seeing things as they are.","Lord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies.","Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.","Keep your friends for friendship, but work with the skilled and competent","Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. They tell you about your own inadequacies.","Those qualities that separate us are often ridiculed by others or criticized by teachers. Because of these judgments, we might see our strengths as disabilities and try to work around them in order to fit in. But anything that is peculiar to our makeup is precisely what we must pay the deepest attention to and lean on in our rise to mastery.","If you view everything through the lens of fear, then you tend to stay in retreat mode. You can just as easily see a crises or problem as a challenge, an opportunity to prove your mettle, the chance to strengthen and toughen yourself, or a call to collective action. By seeing it as a challenge, you will have converted this negative into a positive purely by a mental process that will result in positive action as well.","When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.","Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define if for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions \u2013 your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.","I have an argument that to master any field, it\'s simple: it\'s a function of time. How much you devote yourself to the process, how much experience you get, how much you\'re willing to expand your limits, how willing you are to develop your own style. If you\'re willing to put 10,000 hours, something amazing is going to happen.","The Crown. Place it upon your head and you assume a different post-tranquil yet radiating assurance. Never show doubt, never lose your dignity beneath the crown, or it will not fit. It will seem to be destined for one more worthy. Do not wait for a coronation; the greatest emporers crown themselves.","I just know who I am and what\'s comfortable for me and I don\'t personally do things in life because others do it or because that\'s what society tells me I should do.","A lot of, a big problems that people have nowadays is that they can\'t stand moments of no stimulation in their life so they\'re constantly lurking, looking for entertainment, video games.","Boldness makes even the smallest animal dangerous","Become who you are by learning who you are.","Remember: The best deceivers do everything they can to cloak their roguish qualities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise their dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal of weapons.","All the most successful people nowadays who are truly successful and innovative in their field are not people motivated by money.","There is something I call social intelligence. You can do a lot in life on your own and you can do all kinds of stuff, but if you\'re really bad with people, if you\'re really naive or aggressive and push people away, if you don\'t know the political environment you\'re in, it invalidates all the things you know. You\'re not going to get anywhere.","Life goes by very fast. And the worst thing in life that you can have is a job that you hate, that you have no energy in, that you\'re not creative with and you\'re not thinking of the future. To me, might as well be dead.","I just do what I want to do without hurting other people and you know, I wish other people would do the same.","Grand strategy is the art of looking beyond the present battle and calculating ahead. Focus on your ultimate goal and plot to reach it.","It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause by yourself. By maintaining your independence, you become the master of others \u2014 playing people against one another, making them pursue you.","Hasty climbers have sudden falls.","It is in fact the height of selfishness to merely consume what others create and to retreat into a shell of limited goals and immediate pleasures.","Only create associations with positive affinities. Make this a rule of life and you will benefit more than from all the therapy in the world.","Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory. The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.","In the future, the great division will be between those who have trained themselves to handle these complexities and those who are overwhelmed by them -- those who can acquire skills and discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media around them and can enver focus enough to learn.","Mastery is not a function of I.Q. or natural talent or wealthy parents who can send you to the best school, but rather the result of going through a learning process, fueled by the desire to grow and the persistence to push past any obstacles.","If you want to be powerful in life you have to enjoy the process. You have to get pleasure out of making the thing that you\'re making. There has to be that kind of purpose behind it. If your purpose is simply gaining power, if that becomes your end in life then you end up sort of destroying yourself because you lose the sense of detachment that\'s very necessary.","If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.","The moment people feel they know what to expect from you, your spell on them is broken.","If we experience any failures or setbacks, we do not forget them because they offend our self-esteem. Instead we reflect on them deeply, trying to figure out what went wrong and discern whether there are any patterns to our mistakes.","Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention by appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious than the bland and timid masses.","The problem with human beings is that they can\'t sit alone in a room for more than an hour.","What\'s good for me is certainly not good for other people.","Understand: A person of power instills a kind of fear by deliberately unsettling those around him to keep the initative on his side.","Most people have no sense of self-awareness. They\'re not aware of what they really want. They knew it when they were younger but then as they get older they listened to parents, they listened to peers and they think that, for instance, money is the most important thing when it really isn\'t.","You\'re always feeling powerless in life. If you\'re in an abusive relationship or working for what we call a psychotic boss sometimes the only option is to leave because you\'re emotions get so entangled with these manipulative people that staying there you\'re just helpless because they\'re good at passive aggressive games and you\'re not, so you have to leave.","When people are too present, too familiar or too in our face, something happens to us psychologically. We begin to tune them out, we begin to get sick of them, we begin to know them so well and become so familiar with who they are that we loose a bit of respect for them. You pass a certain threshold with the fact that you\'re too present in their lives, too much in their face and once that threshold is passed you\'re never going to repair it they have lost a certain respect for you.","The human tongue is a beast that few can master.","Mastery is not a question of genetics of luck, but of following your natural inclinations and the deep desires that stirs you from within.","When you show yourself to the world and display your talents, you naturally stir all kinds of resentment, envy, and other manifestations of insecurity... you cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others","If you\'re just letting the time pass at your job, it\'s just dead time and you\'ll never get it back. If at that job you\'re learning and you\'re observing and you\'re seeing about people and connections, it\'s suddenly alive time.","Few are born bold. Even Napoleon had to cultivate the habit on the battlefield, where he knew it was a matter of life and death. In social settings he was awkward and timid, but he overcame this and practice boldness in every part of his life because he saw its tremendous power, how it could literally enlarge a man(even one who, like Napoleon, was in fact conspicuously small).","Be brutal with the past, especially your own, and have no respect for the philosophies that are foisted on you from outside.","If you\'re really driven and you want something deep, hard enough in life, you\'re going to get it.","You cannot make anything worthwhile in this world unless you have first developed and transformed yourself.","Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter","If I could simplify the whole game of power and strategy in one equation, it would all hinge on the capacity to see events around you exactly as they are. The closer your mind is to reality, the better your strategies, your responses in life.","If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox way, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them.They will find away to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.","If you are worried about what others might think and about how your position in the group might be jeopardized, then you will never really create anything.","Her seductive power, however, did not lie in her looks [...]. In reality, Cleopatra was physically unexceptional and had no political power, yet both Caesar and Antony, brave and clever men, saw none of this. What they saw was a woman who constantly transformed herself before their eyes, a one-woman spectacle.Her dress and makeup changed from day to day, but always gave her a heightened, goddesslike appearance. Her words could be banal enough, but were spoken so sweetly that listeners would find themselves remembering not what she said but how she said it.","We happen to live in an era that is incredibly wrapped up in notions of political correctness; everything is seen through the lens of politics. But being political and politically correct is just another way of fighting, another form of power and strategy, an insidious means of manipulation.","Fear creates its own self-fulfilling dynamic- as people give into it, they lose energy and momentum. Their lack of confidence translates into inaction that lowers confidence levels even further, on and on.","Be as fluid as water, do not give your enemies anything solid to atack","People are more complicated than the masks they wear in society.","If you\'re meant to do something like writing and you end up going into banking or finance, your going to be miserable. You\'re trying to fit something into a square peg and a round hole. It\'s just never going to work.","If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.","Be wary of friends\u2014they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.","Nothing is stable in the realm of power, and even closest of friends can be transformed into the worst of enemies.","Everybody knows what they were kind of drawn towards or what they\'re gifted at and it\'s more of courage and looking at yourself and saying, \\"I\'m going to try something and move back in that direction.\\" So it\'s less of an intellectual problem and it\'s more of an emotional problem because as you get into your 30\'s and 40\'s you get addicted to a paycheck and a comfort and you delude yourself into thinking this is what my life is and you lack the guts to be honest with yourself and to make that change.","We must create our own world or we will die from inaction","When you have any kind of success in life, that\'s like the most dangerous moment that you\'re in because you\'re going to tend to think wow, I can just keep repeating what I\'ve done. I\'m a great person. People love me. All of the sudden they\'re giving me all of this attention. You get drunk on it and you lose your sense of balance and your sense of detachment. I know it\'s happened to me.","For the future, the motto is, \\"No days unalert.\\"","The worst thing is to sit and whine and complain and obsess about money as if that were the only sign of your worth as a human.","Nothing is given to you.","When it comes to power, outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all.","Many a serious thinker has been produced in prisons, where we have nothing to do but think.","You\'re not going to be persistent and tenacious enough if you don\'t love what you\'re doing. If it\'s not something that excites you, that appeals to you deep down inside.","Ethics and power are separate. Ethics and morality. I think life would be miserable if there weren\'t some kind of code that people operated by, but history is full of many, many people who have gotten power by very unethical means, and people who were very ethical, who get no power, people who have the most brilliant, lovely, wonderful, nice intentions and bring about horrible things in the world because they don\'t know how to play the power game.","People go into things for the wrong reasons.","The truth is that creative activity is one that involves the entire self - our emotions, our levels of energy, our characters, and our minds.","Some people are a little bit better than others, some people are great, some people are superior. It depends on the level of effort.","If you\'re not careful people will judge you based on these appearances and they will pigeon hole you that this is the person that you are. Your shy, your aggressive, your this type or that type and you lose the control of the dynamic, they become the ones that determine who you are. A powerful person never loses control of the dynamic they are in someway in control.","All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have learned this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.","Actually, your past successes are your biggest obstacle: every battle, every war, is different, and you cannot assume that what worked before will work today.","You could have a lot of money at your fingertips, the finest education and intellectual knowledge, but if you are governed by fear none of that will matter. You will remain tied to dead ideas and stale strategies. You will not be able to adapt. You will lose what you have.","Being the free woman who is sexy and out there is a performance in a way, and being the stay-at-home mom and wife is a performance in itself. All of those performances are living and force you to make decisions about who you really are. Women have to put those performances ahead of things sometimes. Men aren\'t perceived in the same way.","You can never get rid of all of your fears. Some are necessary and a part of life. But most of our fears are illusory, based on risks or threats that exist only in our minds. Such fears constrain and make you miserable. The feeling of moving past a particular fear is one of liberation and freedom.","Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual \u2014 the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoner of goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them \u2014 they are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.","Do not leave your reputation to chance or gossip; it is your life\'s artwork, and you must craft it, hone it, and display it with the care of an artist.","The key to success in any kind of start up is your level of persistence. It\'s not so much your intellect. The Zuckerburg\'s, Pages and Brins, that succeed have such a level of belief in what they are doing that they will put up with the kind of crap that most people won\'t put up with, they are incredibly persistent and resilient.","There\'s no more of an excuse for blaming other people or the world for at least not trying what you should be trying.","In the past, Being able to follow what you\'re naturally \\"should\\" be good at was limited to a very few people in a country like the United States, It was white men who basically had the privileges - or, you name whatever country it is, there\'s some group of elites who, through various processes of democratization and things like the internet and the information that\'s available. It\'s exploding!","Everybody in life is struggling for power, and some people use morality and righteousness as a weapon, while others use different means, even passive aggression. From a distance, we are all fighting, and I am looking at this from a distance.","With such a deep rooted interest you can withstand the setbacks and failures, the days of drudgery, and the hard work that are always a part of any creative action. You can ignore the doubters and critics. You will then feel personally committed to solving the problem and will not rest until you do so.","Any titles, money, or privilege you inherit are actually hindrances. They delude you into believing you are owed respect.","The point of the adversity is to toughen your mind so that you can handle difficult circumstances in life. Your mind, toughen just like you toughen your body. So it really depends on what you need. It really depends on the individual.","You are facing death and danger and competition, but at any moment, you can decide to have a fearless mindset.","You have a set of skills, a way of looking at the world, and often in childhood it was revealed to you by things that you were just kind of naturally drawn to.","If you love music and it requires hours of practice that can be boring, you can survive the boredom, you\'re not going to love it but you can survive the boredom because you\'re connected to something that excites you.","In a society where the roles everyone plays are obvious, the refusal to conform to any standard will excite interest. Be both masculine and feminine, impudent and charming, subtle and outrageous. Let other people worry about being socially acceptable; those types are a dime a dozen, and you are after a power greater than they can imagine.","To be strategic in life is like any skill whether it\'s basketball or learning a language, it takes effort and practice and I think most people don\'t think that it\'s something that they could just do, you know, naturally.","There\'s physical adversity, that if you are someone that likes exercise like I do, I exercise everyday. When you exercise, there\'s pain involved and so you\'re putting yourself through adversity in that situation. It\'s never totally pleasurable and there are moments where it\'s kind of boring or painful and you know that in doing that, you\'re making your mind and body tougher and more resilient. So must be able to deal with the boredom that happens in life.","When the snipe and the mussel struggle, the fisherman gets the benefit. Ancient Chinese saying","When you raise your opinion of yourself and what you are capable of it has a decided influence on what you do.","Love is a lock that linketh noble minds,\\nFaith is the key that shuts the spring of love.","Stop shallow water from running, it will rage; tread on a worm and it will turn.","Be relentless in your pursuit for expansion.","The conventional mind is passive - it consumes information and regurgitates it in familiar forms. The dimensional mind is active, transforming everything it digests into something new and original, creating instead of consuming.","Our levels of desire, patience, persistence, and confidence end up playing a much larger role in success than sheer reasoning powers. Feel motivated and energized, we can overcome almost anything. Feeling bored and restless, our minds shut off and we become increasingly passive.","Nobody is born without fear. We are all born into this world screaming and crying, a bloody mess. We\'re afraid of failing. What differentiates people is that some of them tend to deal more with fearful situations and understand that it\'s hurting them in life. That by becoming fearful they\'re maiming themselves and they learn to move past these fears.","I believe that everybody was born with a kind of uniqueness. There is never going to be somebody else with the same DNA as you, with the same experiences. There is something that you were meant to do as an individual. You have some kind of creative skill. It can either be creating your own business in some level, being a writer, an artist, whatever, or it can even be working within a company, but from within that company you\'re creating something.","The big difference is, as a man, I can go to a bar at two in the morning and people will be like \\"He\'s just a fun guy! That\'s cool that he can balance all these things.\\" But if you see a person that you know who has two young kids and is a mom, there\'s no way those perceptions are the same. It\'s like \\"Oh, there must be a problem.\\" That\'s usually what women face.","What I like about the internet, what I see there is that its much more democratic. I have much more control, and if what I write is liked by the public, I have immediate feedback. There are so many things I want to say - about events in the news, politics, the gamesmanship and manipulations I read about, thoughts that occur to me about the power game, advice, on and on.","Most people are perpetually locked in the present. Their decisions are overly influenced by the most immediate event; they easily become emotional and ascribe greater significance to a problem than it should have in reality.","Ah Franion, treason is loved of many, but the Traitor hated of all: unjust offences may for a time escape without danger, but never without revenge.","Desire is both imitative (we like what others like) and competitive (we want to take away from others what they have). As children, we wanted to monopolize the attention of a parent, to draw it away from other siblings. This sense of rivalry... makes people compete for the attention.","Deception is a developed art of civilization and the most potent weapon in the game of power","We\'re selfish to some degree, that\'s not a criticism and it doesn\'t mean that we are all narcissists. But in any situation our minds naturally evolve to what\'s in it for me? How does this affect me? Can this benefit me? Can this harm me? Then we might move on from that and have a more altruistic point of view about things but that\'s almost always our initial response.","We started filming [with Brandy Burre ]and didn\'t really know, at first, what we were doing. Eventually, the thing just grabbed a hold of both of us and became what it is. But, yeah, we were very close before and we\'re even closer now.","Animals behave in set patterns, which is why we are able to hunt and kill them. Only man has the capacity to consciously alter his behavior, to improvise and overcome the weight of routine and habit.","I find the training of the mind that Zen puts people through is by far to me, the most interesting, one of the most interesting disciplines.","There is nothing more intoxicating than victory, and nothing more dangerous.","As most people when I entered the work world, suddenly people are playing games, being manipulative, being a little bit nasty, you get tricked or you\'re kind of naive and you do something and people come steal your idea.","No one is really going to help you or give you direction. In fact, the odds are against you.","The real poetry and beauty in life comes from an intense relationship with reality in all its aspects. Realism is in fact the ideal we must aspire to, the highest point of human rationality.","The ideas get under your skin. I am honored and deeply excited by the thought that the next generation of writers, or whomever, are influenced by these books.","Her lips are roses over-washed with dew, Or like the purple of Narcissus\' flower; No frost their fair, no wind doth waste their power, But by her breath her beauties to renew.","No one\'s really taking it seriously enough, being more kind of careful and cautious in planning your life out and trying to reach a goal. It takes a great deal of effort - and this cannot be taught.","Hip-hop, you can\'t really do that when you\'re in your 50s.","Twere sin to stain fair Venus\' courts with blood","I\'ve always loved black culture; I don\'t know any other way to put it. Since I was a kid I loved music and early jazz, Sly and the Family Stone.","We [with Brandy Burre ] like fifteen feet away from each other. You can see my house and my car in pretty much every exterior shot in the movie. It was like filming at my extended house. My kids and her kids are the same age and they\'re best friends. Every summer they play with each other. We were intensely close friends beforehand in part because we take care of each other\'s kids.","When there are no other options, people fight harder. If the choice is life or death they have nothing to lose.","Playing with appearances and mastering the arts of deception are among the aesthetic pleasures of life. They are also key components in the acquisition of power.","Defeat Them in Detail: The Divide and Conquer Strategy. Look at the parts and determine how to control the individual parts, create dissension and leverage it.","The pyramid would start at the bottom: you don\'t know who you are or what you\'re intended to do in life. And so, the X factor - the ingredient that will make you powerful, that will make you successful is your energy and drive and your tenacity. If you\'ve got that, there\'s nothing in the world that\'s going to stop you.","I know My God commands, whose power no power resists.","By wit we search divine aspect above,\\nBy wit we learn what secrets science yields,\\nBy wit we speak, by wit the mind is rul\'d,\\nBy wit we govern all our actions;\\nWit is the loadstar of each human thought,\\nWit is the tool by which all things are wrought.","Your ability to work with people directly affects your ability to get work done in the world.","Do not envy those who seem to be naturally gifted; it is often a curse, as such types rarely learn the value of diligence and focus, and they pay for this later in life.","It looks like I had the most irrelevant education than anybody in the planet could have.","I hate the way war is seen as something inherently brutal and ugly. Yes, much of war brings out the worst part of our [people\'s] nature. But in war, all kinds of noble human traits have been developed, such as discipline, cohesion, pride.","To succeed in the game of power, you have to master your emotions. But even if you succeed in gaining such self-control, you can never control the temperamental dispositions of those around you. And this presents a great danger.","The information walls are completely crumbling.","Actually learning ancient Greek was a brilliant practice of mine because you\'d sit there and you\'d read a sentence and sometimes it would take you a day, an entire day to figure out one sentence. But it really trains you to be analytical, to think in a certain way to try and interpret what something means. So I\'ve been thinking like that my whole life and then I love Machiavelli and I love thinking about politics that way. So it\'s sort of all that put together and then the good luck to meet a man who is sort of interested in the same thing.","The need for certainty is the greatest disease the Mind faces","To me, no matter what we do, we all strive for that experience.","We have consciousness and rational powers but unless you\'re willing to spend the time to gain control of yourself, gain control of your emotions, to think deeply about what you want in a year or two, or where you want your business to be, you\'re going to be swept away by every new event that occurs in the course of the day or the week and the small amount of time that you plan, that you address to conscious planning, is never enough to overcome the constant tide of emotions and new things happening.","All masters want to appear more brilliant than other people.","Religion humanizes this universe, makes us feel important and loved. We are not animals governed by uncontrollable drives, animals that die for no apparent reason, but creatures made in the image of supreme being","One could draw up all different kinds of adversity depending on what your weakness is.","Never take your position for granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head.","I am impressed when I go on the internet and see a lot of young people who\'ve been influenced by the books, or I meet someone who tells me how it has changed their life. To me, that is much more real than sales figures.","When someone is not there all the time it gives us space to think about them. Your job in influence and persuasion is to get the other person to think about you or your product without you forcing yourself upon them or without you making them think about you.","Our natural tendency is to project onto other people our own belief and value systems, in ways in which we are not even aware.","I was working on other things and I wanted to make a film, and I had some ideas brewing in my head. Brandy\'s [ Burre] circumstance was such that I didn\'t really know what was going to happen. That was obviously a surprise, but I knew she was in her mid-to-late thirties and she was starting to really think about her life in a way that really appealed to me, appealed to the women that I know in my life.","The time that leads to mastery is dependent on the intensity of our focus.","The key to power, then, is the ability to judge who is best able to further your interests in all situations. Keep friends for friendship, but work with the skilled and competent.","When you understand the fear then you can begin to move past it. So when I hear the people say it\'s innate, you can\'t learn it, I just want to hit them in the head.","Things like reading a book or learning a language, or taking a walk - they\'re not stimulating. Your mind has to sort of learn how to deal with that kind of stimulation on its own. So that\'s a very important form of adversity.","If marriage isn\'t something for me, but I like living with someone or being committed, I can choose this other path as long as she\'s okay with it but I would hardly say that that should be what other people do. Some people want that, that written paper, that commitment and that means something to them. And I don\'t in the least look down on it.","I have examples of people who find their way back later on in life, in their 30\'s, 40\'s, it can happen in your 50\'s, I\'m sure it can. It\'s not really a science. It\'s maybe more of an art.","A few years ago, for my birthday, Sean Price Williams said, \\"I\'ll give you one free day of shooting.\\" He shot Kati with an I and co-shot Fake It So Real. While we\'ve always worked together, I didn\'t want him to do it for free, so he cashed in his birthday chip and came for this one day.","I have the point that everybody essentially have these unique set of DNA you have. There\'s something different about you genetically. You are unique is what I am trying to say - the combination of experiences and emotions you have felt are never repeated.","Sadness of any sort is also seductive, particularly if it seems deep-rooted, even spiritual, rather than needy or pathetic\u2014it makes people come to you.","You can\'t disengage yourself from that game if you are completely unaware of what people out there might be doing, you\'re just going to be tripped up, you\'re going to find yourself continually at a disadvantage.","A lot of people in college go astray because they choose something that doesn\'t really, really connect to them. And if it doesn\'t connect to you, you\'re not able to put in that 10,000 hours that people talk about. You don\'t have the focus. And you start off in life on the wrong foot and you never get back.","The key then to attaining this higher level of intelligence is to make our years of study qualitatively rich. We don\'t simply absorb information - we internalize it and make it our own by finding some way to put this knowledge to practical use.","What will seduce a person is the effort we expend on their behalf, showing how much we care, how much they are worth. Leaving things to chance is a recipe for disaster, and reveals that we do not take love and romance very seriously.","One of the things I\'ve been talking about with my critical writing and my own work is that these movies are seen differently in a theatrical space. It\'s very important to me. I edit films to be seen theatrically, like fiction material I\'ve worked on like Listen Up Phillip or other documentaries.","The combination of experiences and emotions you have felt are never repeated.","Expand your notion of what adversity is.","I really do think you shoot for that beautiful experience of showing your movie in a crowd or room full of people, or even just one person who happens to go to a matinee screening.","If you are armed with knowledge, if you are aware that certain dynamics are at play then you have options. You can play defense, you can ignore certain person and take the consequences perhaps with a game plan in mind and it goes on, you\'ve increased your options.","There is a tremendous problem in modern culture. We have become used to everything coming to us with tremendous speed and ease. It is a culture where discipline and patience is almost impossible to develop.","One person reads the book, and cannot help telling a friend. That is vastly superior to any kind of advertisement, or clever magazine article. That is also the great power of the internet, where people share their opinions without the annoying screen of the media, and so much of the presence of my books has come from the Internet. It\'s a new era, a new form of war, and I embrace it.","A lot of things in history are timing, and it\'s very peculiar because in retrospect things [and] people can look more brilliant or necessary than they actually were.","The music business is just the worst as far as Machiavellian, sharky, evil games going on, as far as manipulation.","Even if it\'s a \\"talking head documentary\\" about a social movement or something along those lines, I\'ve always thought of editing the timing and the sense of the piece for the theatrical experience.","Our times might emphasize equality, which we then mistake for the need for everyone to be the same, but what we really mean by this is the equal chance for people to express their differences, to let a thousand flowers bloom.","It\'s good to have a brand that is consistent that people know about and trust. But it\'s also good to mix it up and adapt it, to polish it a bit and give it a new aspect. To not violate the reputation you\'ve established but give it a new edge and veneer to show other aspects that people hadn\'t suspected.","For as one star another far exceeds, So souls in heaven are placed by their deeds.","It\'s okay to be lost in college.","The passive ironic attitude is not cool or romantic, but pathetic and destructive.","Whether people are making narrative cinema or experimental cinematic movie experiences, they all want the biggest screen possible and the quietest room and the most attention to every nuance and detail. Obviously, most people will not see the movie that way, but I can still hope for it, and I\'d like to think we will be able to pull it off this time.","Jay-Z is more naturally gifted. He didn\'t depend as much as 50 did on his personal story. Jay-Z has a great story, he came from a pretty rough background. But 50\'s early success was so much fueled on the story and where he came from. With Jay-Z, I feel he has a more natural gift for language and for music itself. 50 really had to study and work at it much harder.","If you\'re in a subordinate position of some sort and pretty much all of us are at some point in our lives, your general tendency is to try and impress the people above you or person above you so well that they will like you, keep you or maybe promote you. In the process of doing that you are not aware that that person above has insecurities and if you try so hard they may see that you are after their job or that you are better than they are or they might envy the fact you are younger.","Because of my two films - one was about my half-sister (Kati with an I) and the next one featured my cousin (Fake It So Real) - I was hesitant to start with someone so close.","The whole concept of stage fright is fascinating. Actors get stage fright, but they wouldn\'t be on the stage in the first place if they just succumbed to it. There\'s this love/hate relationship with the spotlight.","Nobody that I know really likes the feeling of having no power and not being able to influence people. But most of us aren\'t too conscious of what we are trying to do and get that control and that power so people end up sort of playing all kinds of unconscious manipulative games or they\'re sort of half aware, they have an idea of a strategy or goal they want to use and they think about it. But then in the heat of the moment, it kind of all flies out the window.","There\'s a real tension between it being a collaborative art process, which is almost like performance art of yourself, and, as we talk about the movie, it\'s kind of a mix between melodrama and cin\xe9ma v\xe9rit\xe9. This involves ideas about playing the role of yourself and the movie of your life and all these other things.","Always say less than necessary.","Ah, were she pitiful as she is fair,Or but as mild as she is seeming so,Then were my hopes greater than my despair,Then all the world were heaven, nothing woe.","50 is a great person. I was a little intimidated when I met him for the first time in 2006. I didn\'t know what to expect. It ended up we got along really well. That\'s why we decided to do a book together, The 50th Law of Power.","We are a social animal, power only exists in a social sense, we have to work in groups.","The problem is that we humans are deep conformists.","There\'s spatial intelligence. they\'re, which end up being, people going into math or music. there\'s mechanical where you work well with your hands. There\'s an intelligence with language that would lead someone into writing. So it\'s not necessarily that you\'re six years old and you know you\'re going to be a lawyer Or you\'re going into tech startups or computers. It\'s something more elemental than that. It\'s that this is a skill, a way of thinking that comes naturally to me that I was drawn to and it was very clear in childhood.","I don\'t want to promote paranoia. It\'s not like wow, everybody is after me. You know that\'s not going to be very powerful. A person like Stalin was like that and he was powerful, but it ended up completely destroying him because he couldn\'t trust anyone.","I didn\'t like writing just articles and things. So then I wandered around. I tried my hand at film and television and that was a worse fit because I don\'t really have a mind for that.","Ah! what is love! It is a pretty thing, As sweet unto a shepherd as a king, And sweeter too; For kings have cares that wait upon a crown, And cares can make the sweetest love to frown.","There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring friends that secretly afflicts them. The injury will come out slowly: A little more honesty, flashes of resentment and envy here and there, and before you know it your friendship fades. The more favors and gifts you supply to revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive.","Hip-hop has a feeling element, it\'s not just about knowing music. It\'s not like classical music or jazz where you can go on raw energy.","Weep not, my wanton, smile upon my knee;When thou art old there\'s grief enough for thee.","You want attention, you want to grab some of that airspace that exists out there in a world that\'s very difficult to get it because it\'s so competitive and to get it for more than a few seconds. Any attention is good and that can be what we would normally consider as bad attention so I wanted to make you aware of that dynamic.","To a large extent, the political walls are crumbling.","Everything changes. This is the key to feeling powerful, but also to being creative in the world.","A noble mind disdains to hide his head, And let his foes triumph in his overthrow.","When it comes to mastering a skill, time is the magic ingredient.","People want to feel united, they want to have that religious sense they want to feel like at a rave 10,000 people at the rave are feeling the same emotions, a very primal need that\'s not being fulfilled in the world today.","Along the way, a lot of filmmakers get rid of things that are messy or don\'t fit in some ways. To me, I want to work with serendipity and things we happened upon. That\'s our job, that\'s what the form demands.","It\'s sometimes hard to talk about politics and art. Obviously, I have my core beliefs, but I think art is best when it\'s troublesome and pushes against stuff.","When it comes to fertility, there are so may things that have to go right. In any one individual, there might be one major problem and two minor ones or no major ones and seven minor ones. Throw in another person\'s physiology, and it\'s complicated. I try to give people the knowledge that they can make as many changes as they want.","The idea of social performance, that we\'re always performing identities, is something I got fairly obsessed with. I think it\'s probably because I am a person who went to 15 different elementary and middle schools. I moved all the time, often having to run out in the middle of the night because my mom couldn\'t pay the bills. There were schools where I\'d be the poor loser kid. There were schools where I\'d suddenly be the smart kid or the cool kid, although that was very seldom.","I just think there\'s something in the non-fiction form that allows you to see things clearly, if you\'re patient.","I think I can do whatever I want with fiction, but the more documentary it is, the better it will be because that\'s what I\'m good at. I\'m good at observing people\'s behavior and putting these unspoken things into movie contexts in ways that other people can sometimes miss.","I make non-fiction partly because I\'m not that good of a writer. My talent, if I have any, is in balancing, capturing and directing reality, rather than creating scenarios.","I have sort of issues with my claustrophobia where being on an airplane or if I force myself, to put myself in these circumstances that I kind of, am afraid of, that can be a way to toughen me up.","Your college education is a key moment in life.","It\'s okay to be kind of looking for what you want and trying out all kinds of different ideas and different course work, etc.","I\'m probably, if I might, if I stray I might write, go into screenplay or do something in film. Something like that but I think I\'m pretty much going to stick to what I\'m good at.","I want to be able to write, that\'s my first love and I don\'t want to deviate from it even though I probably could have made a lot more money.","I like lecturing and going around the world and giving talks and I like doing consulting and helping people.","The problem is the book business is changing so we\'re in a difficult moment now and if the business model is changing, I don\'t know if I\'m going to have to look what\'s in store for me at that level but fortunately, I broke in earlier.","I exercise a lot and I love it. I\'m fine. But you know, I\'d like to be alive in ten years, that\'d be my first priority.","I\'m okay for things like theater and stuff but for film, I just didn\'t think in the right way and I didn\'t like the business. So I was unhappy. So I was in something that was moderately related to my, what I call my calling or my life\'s path, which is writing, but it wasn\'t like the right fit.","I\'ve always been kind of a strategic thinking person - I love sports for instance, but my interest in sports is \'cause I love watching strategy in action or playing it. I\'m not into the drama so much, of the physical action. I\'m interested in the coach and how he\'s strategizing.","I\'m the kind of person that wants to analyze and I think having a background in, strangely enough, in like literature and languages, I\'m always analyzing things.","I\'ll probably take the prize for the most irrelevant degree. Although some of the things now where they study, you know: \\"post feministic colonial film theory\\" - those kind of majors, yeah, that\'s probably worse. But I was, you know, classics, Greek and Latin, like what\'s more irrelevant than dead languages, you know?","I\'ve always been intrigued by fighter pilots and strategy because it occurs in like, milliseconds, you know.","Everything is personal.","Early on in life I knew that I was a writer, that I just wanted to write, I love books, I love literature and after graduating college, I kind of wandered around in Europe learning languages and writing novels and never led anywhere. And then I got into like journalism in New York as a way to kind of maybe find my way into the field and it wasn\'t a good fit. It just wasn\'t right for me.","Everybody wants power and control in their life.","It\'s fortunately a kind of society we live in where we can be diverse. People can take different paths and not feel like they\'re doing something wrong.","There was writing and foreign languages. I always had an ease with foreign languages. So the both are related, both language related kind of mind.","People who are reading my books, or who are thinking about it, have some general idea about the concept of strategy. They\'re better off than somebody that has none. So I would never say it\'s useless.","There are things that you study, classes you\'ve taken, activities you\'ve done that feel right, that feel like they\'re in your power zone. So it doesn\'t take incredible amount of effort for you to do it - it just comes more naturally to you.","There are people that don\'t need to run towards adversity. They grew up in circumstances where it\'s forced upon them. Other people lead, pushier lives. So there are all kinds of forms of adversity in the world.","I\'m afraid I\'m just too intense to have soft ideas, you know, about what to read when you\'re trying to pass the time.","The wrong way to look at your university life is to say it\'s like job training, unless you\'re going into something very specific.","If you are interested in a form of science or interested in a particular kind of business or whatever - or if you want to be a writer, there\'s so much information out there, it\'s almost too much.","I think the homeless thing is very interesting and I think is an incredible exercise.","If you\'re only ten feet above, then you\'re better than when you\'re on the ground.","You must bear in mind that each law is circumstantial. It does depend on the circumstances.","If you have millions and millions of dollars, you\'re living in a totally different world. You don\'t feel it anymore and you\'ve got to feel it.","A lot of the things that involve power on the highest levels sometimes involve the darker side of human psychology. People can be very passive aggressive or they can be aggressive and they can conceal their intentions. There\'s this world that exists that nobody writes about or describes it\'s like a dirty little secret or taboo.","Then grew a wrinkle on fair Venus\' brow, The amber sweet of love is turn\'d to gall! Gloomy was Heaven; bright Phoebus did avow He would be coy, and would not love at all; Swearing no greater mischief could be wrought, Than love united to a jealous thought.","An ecosystem that has the maximum amount of diversity is the richest.","No greater mischief could be wrought\\nThan love united to a jealous thought.","On woman Nature did bestow two eyes, Like Hemian\'s bright lamps, in matchless beauty shining, Whose beams do soonest captivate the wise And wary heads, made rare by art\'s refining.","Deceiving world, that with alluring toysHast made my life the subject of thy scorn,And scornest now to lend thy fading joys,T\'outlength my life, whom friends have left forlorn;How well are they that die ere they be born,And never see thy sleights, which few men shunTill unawares they helpless are undone!","I think what happened with Brandy [Burre]is what happens with a lot of people. You make these decisions for comfort and stability, and then eventually those same things that are comforting and stable end up putting walls around you that you didn\'t expect.","Practically every profession has a really political environment. I think the world has become more competitive. There are so many people in every place competing for small slices of success and power. It\'s a heated atmosphere and whenever you have competition, you\'re going to have more politics and manipulation.","My greatest wish is that a certain way of looking at the world, a way I show in all of my books, gets into my readers\' heads, and slowly alters their perception.","Be Royal in your Own Fashion: Act like a King to be treated","The dreamers, those who misread the actual state of affairs and act upon their emotions, are often the source of the greatest mistakes in history-the wars that are not thought out, the disasters that are not foreseen","I\'m a big believer in being an entrepreneur. It\'s easy for me to say because I work for myself and I am someone who likes that process. You have control over your destiny.","If you\'re consumed only with the big dream, you\'re going to die because you won\'t be able to feed yourself or you\'re going to be losing your job, so you\'ll just be sitting in your room dreaming, but if you\'re only holding onto the crap jobs that keep you just above of the water you\'re going to be unhappy. You\'re going to be burnt out, washed out.","If you\'re in your early twenties, don\'t put so much importance on the money, on the raise. Getting an extra thousand dollars a year is okay, but the real thing is the responsibility and the power and the experience that you\'re learning.","The quiet mind is richer than a crown....Such sweet content, such minds, such sleep, such bliss beggars enjoy when princes oft do miss.","Compelling spectacles are not to reach a niche market, it could be for reaching a niche marketing but on a grand scale. This is for grand marketing.","In the opening stage of most careers any attention is what you want, any attention is good attention, even if it\'s bad attention.","When I think about the new film, I think I can do whatever I want with fiction, but the more documentary it is, the better it will be because that\'s what I\'m good at. I\'m good at observing people\'s behavior and putting these unspoken things into movie contexts in ways that other people can sometimes miss.","I think it comes in cycles for Brandy [Burre] and for many women. You want to take care of your home, making it as good as possible for your kids and for yourself, and then eventually you feel trapped and you want to break out of that. You want to be someone else and you want the world to look at you as something else. Eventually, you come back again. The cycles are very much a part of her life.","Sovereign of beauty, like the spray she grows;Compass\'d she is with thorns and canker\'d bower.Yet, were she willing to be pluck\'d and worn,She would be gather\'d, though she grew on thorn.","Religion is the great balm of existence because it takes us outside ourselves, connects us to something larger","Thy breath is like the steame of apple-pyes.","Hangs in the uncertain balance of proud time.","I also make movies that can be seen on a small screen, as I shoot on digital video. Hopefully they can be seen small and can live like that.","In some ways, the documentary form is a kind of trap and so is societal norms.","One can never expect critics to behave in any predictable way.","Never be put off by your target\'s anger; it is a sure sign of enslavement.","Set a beggar on horse backe, they saie, and hee will neuer alight.","Still uncertain as to our identity, we think that what matters in the work world is gaining attention and making friends. And these misconceptions and na\xefvet\xe9 are brutally exposed in the light of the real world.","Creative Endeavors are by their nature uncertain.","Only your hearts be frolic, for the time Craves that we taste of naught but jouissance.","Real action and true helpfulness are perhaps the ultimate charm.","A mind content both crown and kingdom is.","Though men determine, the gods doo dispose: and oft times many things fall out betweene the cup and the lip.","If we were controlling the performance, we never would have had someone push a button to make the pellet stove come on during a climatic moment. And after the loud pellet stove moment, which is like a Todd Haynes\'s Safe interruption into the home and into the narrative - as if the home is a like a ghost surrounding the characters - her performance changes entirely.","It\'s funny how it reads like a Kubrick-inspired moment, a filmmaker controlling one\'s mise en sc\xe8ne. What it truly is is a documentary moment.","I want my movies to play in movie theaters. While festivals can fulfill a part of that, there\'s nothing like getting a week-long run for your movie. It\'s becoming increasingly difficult to get that.","Kati with an I was a New York Times Critics\' Pick and I was really happy that it got a run uptown in Harlem at the Maysles Cinema, which is a great space but isn\'t necessarily the most well attended for a week-long screening.","My goal for Actress is to have it play more traditional theaters.","Movie theaters barely make any money. A movie can make a couple of thousand dollars, or could get lucky and make ten or fifteen thousand dollars, but theatrical releases don\'t really sustain the work. For me, it\'s the best sort of advertisement for anything else you\'d want to do.","Obviously there\'s Netflix, iTunes, and Amazon and all these other outlets. Fake It So Real is now on Fandor, and I think people have actually seen it there, which is fine.","News makes things black and white. Documentary filmmaking should do the opposite.","Most people are passive aggressive in this world. I have the idea that the human being is born with a kind of reservoir of aggression. We are inherently somewhat aggressive creatures and we either channel that in direct ways or we channel it in indirect ways and become passive aggressive.","As a writer you know you don\'t have to deal with a lot of the crap that most people deal with, the political things. Every couple of years when your book comes out then you have to go into these fights with the publisher and the publicist and that\'s it.","I don\'t know that Brandy [Burre] would ever categorize herself as being trapped, but I felt like I saw her being trapped. When she\'s cleaning the room and she puts the labels on the toys, that was something that my wife, who\'s also friends with Brandy, was very adamant that we try to capture. My wife said that showed to her Brandy\'s creative outlet because she can\'t be creative in the ways that she used to be or that she maybe wants to be in the future.","Here in Beacon, I feel like this was the worst year yet. The entire town, like a lot of winter towns, just kind of holed up in the winter.","We\'re close friends [with Brandy Burre]. We\'re neighbors. I actually lived two houses over from her for a while and then we were traveling one day and she was looking at the house we currently live in - which was between us - and she\'s like, \\"You guys should move here! It\'s bigger and better!\\"","Your work is the single greatest means at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence.","I often daydream about the future, thinking of the world in 100, 200 years, imagining what it looks like, feels like. I hope that my books are like ghosts that will inhabit this future.","LAW 4 Always Say Less Than Necessary When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.","LAW 46Never Appear Too PerfectAppearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.","LAW 25Re-Create YourselfDo not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define if for you.

It strains constantly to break out of its cage, and if it is not tamed, it will tun wild and cause you grief.","LAW 38Think As You Like But Behave Like OthersIf you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch.

No one moved a muscle. After a few seconds of tense silence, Khrushchev finally said in a quiet voice, \u201cNow you know why I didn\u2019t stop him.\u201d Instead of just arguing that anyone facing Stalin was afraid, knowing that the slightest sign of rebellion would mean certain death, he had made them feel what it was like to face Stalin\u2014had made them feel the paranoia, the fear of speaking up, the terror of confronting the leader, in this case Khrushchev. The demonstration was visceral and no more argument was necessary.\u201d","We are all in search of feeling more connected to reality\u2014to other people, the times we live in, the natural world, our character, and our own uniqueness. Our culture increasingly tends to separate us from these realities in various ways. We indulge in drugs or alcohol, or engage in dangerous sports or risky behavior, just to wake ourselves up from the sleep of our daily existence and feel a heightened sense of connection to reality. In the end, however, the most satisfying and powerful way to feel this connection is through creative activity. Engaged in the creative process we feel more alive than ever, because we are making something and not merely consuming, Masters of the small reality we create.

Instead think of them the way you think of children, or pets, not important enough to affect your mental balance","The most effective attitude to adopt is one of supreme acceptance. The world is full of people with different characters and temperaments. We all have a dark side, a tendency to manipulate, and aggressive desires. The most dangerous types are those who repress their desires or deny the existence of them, often acting them out in the most underhanded ways. Some people have dark qualities that are especially pronounced. You cannot change such people at their core, but must merely avoid becoming their victim. You are an observer of the human comedy, and by being as tolerant as possible, you gain a much greater ability to understand people and to influence their behavior when necessary","The problem with all students, he said, is that they inevitably stop somewhere. They hear an idea and they hold on to it until it becomes dead; they want to flatter themselves that they know the truth. But true Zen never stops, never congeals into such truths. That is why everyone must constantly be pushed to the abyss, starting over and feeling their utter worthlessness as a student. Without suffering and doubts, the mind will come to rest on clich\xe9s and stay there, until the spirit dies as well. Not even enlightenment is enough. You must continually start over and challenge yourself.","Your fears are a kind of prison that confines you within a limited range of action. The less you fear, the more power you will have and the more fully you will live.","Oysters open completely when the moon is full; and when the crab sees one it throws a piece of stone or seaweed into it and the oyster cannot close again so that it serves the crab for meat. Such is the fate of him who opens his mouth too much and thereby puts himself at the mercy of the listener. Leonardo da Vinci, 1452-1519","By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.","There is too little mystery in the world; too many people say exactly what they feel or want.","Fools say that they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by others\u2019 experience.","With our limited senses and consciousness, we only glimpse a small portion of reality. Furthermore, everything in the universe is in a state of constant flux. Simple words and thoughts cannot capture this flux or complexity. The only solution for an enlightened person is to let the mind absorb itself in what it experiences, without having to form a judgment on what it all means. The mind must be able to feel doubt and uncertainty for as long as possible. As it remains in this state and probes deeply into the mysteries of the universe, ideas will come that are more dimensional and real than if we had jumped to conclusions and formed judgments early on.","Events in life mean nothing if you do not reflect on them in a deep way, and ideas from books are pointless if they have no application to life as you live it.","Hide your intentions not by closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspicious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals-just not the real ones.","If, for example, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a certain limit; only generous souls attain greatness.","You must understand the following: In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it. Your interest must transcend the field itself and border on the religious.","The key to such power is ambiguity. In a society where the roles everyone plays are obvious, the refusal to conform to any standard will excite interest. Be both masculine and feminine, impudent and charming, subtle and outrageous. Let other people worry about being socially acceptable; those types are a dime a dozen, and you are after a power greater than they can imagine.","Everything that happens to you is a form of instruction if you pay attention.","Some 2,600 years ago the ancient Greek poet Pindar wrote, \u201cBecome who you are by learning who you are. What he meant is the following: You are born with a particular makeup and tendencies that mark you as a piece of fate. It is who you are to the core. Some people never become who they are; they stop trusting in themselves; they conform to the tastes of others, and they end up wearing a mask that hides their true nature. If you allow yourself to learn who you really are by paying attention to that voice and force within you, then you can become what you were fated to become\u2014an individual, a Master.\u201d","Without enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels sharpens our wits, keeping us focused and alert. It is sometimes better, then, to use enemies as enemies rather than transforming them into friends or allies.","Power is a game, and in games you do not judge your opponents by their intentions but by the effects of their actions.","A natural response when people feel overwhelmed is to retreat into various forms of passivity. If we don\u2019t try too much in life, if we limit our circle of action, we can give ourselves the illusion of control. The less we attempt, the less chances of failure. If we can make it look like we are not really responsible for our fate, for what happens to us in life, then our apparent powerlessness is more palatable.","Long Time. The famous seventeenth-century Ming painter Chou Yung relates a story that altered his behavior forever. Late one winter afternoon he set out to visit a town that lay across the river from his own town. He was bringing some important books and papers with him and had commissioned a young boy to help him carry them. As the ferry neared the other side of the river, Chou Yung asked the boatman if they would have time to get to the town before its gates closed, since it was a mile away and night was approaching. The boatman glanced at the boy, and at the bundle of loosely tied papers and books\u2014\u201cYes, he replied, \u201cif you do not walk too fast.\u201d As they started out, however, the sun was setting. Afraid of being locked out of the town at night, prey to local bandits, Chou and the boy walked faster and faster, finally breaking into a run. Suddenly the string around the papers broke and the documents scattered on the ground. It took them many minutes to put the packet together again, and by the time they had reached the city gates, it was too late. When you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a nest of problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much longer than if you had taken your time.\u201d","you must engrave deeply in your mind and never forget: your emotional commitment to what you are doing will be translated into your work. If you go at your work with half a heart, it will show in the lackluster results and in the laggard way in which you reach the end. If you are doing something primarily for money and without a real emotional commitment, it will translate into something that lacks a soul and that has no connection to you. You may not see this, but you can be sure that the public will feel it and that they will receive your work in the same lackluster spirit it was created in. If you are excited and obsessive in the hunt, it will show in the details. If your work comes from a place deep within, its authenticity will be communicated.","All of us have access to a higher form of intelligence, one that can allow us to see more of the world, to anticipate trends, to respond with speed and accuracy to any circumstance. This intelligence is cultivated by deply immersing ourselves in a field of study and staying true to our inclinations, no matter how unconventional our approach might seem to other. Through such intense immersion over many years we come to internalize and gain an intuitive feel with the rational processes, we expand our minds to the outer limits of our potential and are able to see into the secret core of life itself. We then come to have powers that approximate the instinctive force and speed of animals, but with the added reach that our human consciousness brings us. This power is what our brains are designed to attain, and we will naturally led to this type of intelligence if we follow our inclinations to their ultimate ends.","A man said to a Dervish: \u201cWhy do I not see you more often? The Dervish replied, \u201cBecause the words \u2018Why have you not been to see me?\u2019 are sweeter to my ear than the words \u2018Why have you come again?\u201d","You like to imagine yourself in control of your fate, consciously planning the course of your life as best you can. But you are largely unaware of how deeply your emotions dominate you. They make you veer toward ideas that soothe your ego. They make you look for evidence that confirms what you already want to believe. They make you see what you want to see, depending on your mood, and this disconnect from reality is the source of the bad decisions and negative patterns that haunt your life. Rationality is the ability to counteract these emotional effects, to think instead of react, to open your mind to what is really happening, as opposed to what you are feeling. It does not come naturally; it is a power we must cultivate, but in doing so we realize our greatest potential.","Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good.","It is your own bad strategies, not the unfair opponent, that are to blame for your failures. You are responsible for the good and bad in your life.","DESPISE THE FREE LUNCH JUDGMENT What is offered for free is dangerous-it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise to pay the full price\u2014there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power.","The Shadow. It cannot be grasped. Chase your shadow and it will, flee; turn your back on it and it will follow you. It is also a person\u2019s dark side, the thing that makes them mysterious. After they have given us pleasure, the shadow of their withdrawal makes us yearn for their return, much as clouds make us yearn for the sun.","Just imagine for a day that you do not know anything, that what you believe could be completely false. Let go of your preconceptions and even your most cherished beliefs. Experiment. Force yourself to hold the opposite opinion or see the world through your enemy\u2019s eyes. Listen to the people around you with more attentiveness. See everything as a source for education\u2014even the most banal encounters. Imagine that the world is still full of mystery.","Do not wait for a coronation; the greatest emperors crown themselves.","You cannot repress anger or love, or avoid feeling them, and you should not try.","Sometimes any emotion is better than the boredom of security.","It is not much good being wise among fools and sane among lunatics.","What does it matter if another player, your friend or rival, intended good things and had only your interests at heart, if the effects of his action lead to so much ruin and confusion? It is only natural for people to cover up their actions with all kinds of justifications, always assuming that they have acted out of goodness. You must learn to inwardly laugh each time you hear this and never get caught up in gauging someone\u2019s intentions and actions through a set of moral judgments that are really an excuse for the accumulation of power.","Understand: your mind is weaker than your emotions. But you become aware of this weakness only in moments of adversity--precisely the time whenyou need strength. What best equips you to cope with tthe heat of battle is neither more knowledge nor more intellect. What makes your mind stronger, and more able to control your emotions, is internal discipline and toughness.No one can teach you this skill; you cannot learn it by reading about it. Like any discipline, it can come only through practice, experience, even a little suffering. The first step in building up presence of mind is to see the need for ii -- to want it badly enough to be willing to work for it.","LAW 9 WIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT JUDGMENT Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.","Too often we make a separation in our lives\u2014there is work and there is life outside work, where we find real pleasure and fulfillment. Work is often seen as a means for making money so we can enjoy that second life that we lead. Even if we derive some satisfaction from our careers we still tend to compartmentalize our lives in this way. This is a depressing attitude, because in the end we spend a substantial part of our waking life at work. If we experience this time as something to get through on the way to real pleasure, then our hours at work represent a tragic waste of the short time we have to live.","if no resistances or obstacles face you, you must create them. No seduction can proceed without them.","Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.","Never argue. In society nothing must be discussed; give only results. (Benjamin Disraeli, 1804\u20131881)","The Tiny Wound. \xa0 \xa0 It is small but painful and irritating. You try all sorts of medicaments, you com- plain, you scratch and pick at the scab. Doctors only make it worse, transforming the tiny wound into a grave matter.

You need to develop your powers of concentration, and understand that trying to multitask will be the death of the process.","JUDGMENT Be wary of friends\u2014they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.","As Graci\xe1n said, \u201cThe truth is generally seen, rarely heard.","If you come across any special trait of meanness or stupidity\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. you must be careful not to let it annoy or distress you, but to look upon it merely as an addition to your knowledge\u2014a new fact to be considered in studying the character of humanity. Your attitude towards it will be that of the mineralogist who stumbles upon a very characteristic specimen of a mineral. \u2014Arthur Schopenhauer","But the greatest battle of all is with yourself\u2014your weaknesses, your emotions, your lack of resolution in seeing things through to the end. You must declare unceasing war on yourself.","Let us call this quality the Original Mind. This mind looked at the world more directly\u2014not through words and received ideas. It was flexible and receptive to new information. Retaining a memory of this Original Mind, we cannot help but feel nostalgia for the intensity with which we used to experience the world. As the years pass, this intensity inevitably diminishes. We come to see the world through a screen of words and opinions; our prior experiences, layered over the present, color what we see. We no longer look at things as they are, noticing their details, or wonder why they exist. Our minds gradually tighten up. We become defensive about the world we now take for granted, and we become upset if our beliefs or assumptions are attacked.","There is a popular saying in Japan that goes \u201cTada yori takai mono wa nai, meaning: \u201cNothing is more costly than something given free of charge.\u201d THE UNSPOKEN WAY, MICHIHIRO MATSUMOTO, 1988\u201d","[M]any believe that by being honest and open they are winning people\u2019s hearts and showing their good nature.They are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instrument, which bloodies more than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to offend people; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or think. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so predictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you, and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions.","It is natural to want to employ your friends when you find yourself in times of need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends soften the harshness. Besides, you know them. Why depend on a stranger when you have a friend at hand? Men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit, because gratitude is a burden and revenge a pleasure. TACITUS, c. A.D. 55-120 The problem is that you often do not know your friends as well as you imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend each other. They laugh extra hard at each other\u2019s jokes. Since honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels. Friends will say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in clothes\u2014maybe they mean it, often they do not. When you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualities he or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of kindness that unbalances everything. People want to feel they deserve their good fortune. The receipt of a favor can become oppressive: It means you have been chosen because you are a friend, not necessarily because you are deserving. There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring friends that secretly afflicts them. The injury will come out slowly: A little more honesty, flashes of resentment and envy here and there, and before you know it your friendship fades. The more favors and gifts you supply to revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive. Ingratitude has a long and deep history. It has demonstrated its powers for so many centuries, that it is truly amazing that people continue to underestimate them. Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude from a friend, you will be pleasantly surprised when they do prove grateful. The problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably limit your power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help you; and in the end, skill and competence are far more important than friendly feelings.","Image: An Oak Tree. The oak that resists the wind loses its branches one by one, and with nothing left to protect it, the trunk fi nally snaps.

They present an appearance that is often deceptive\u2014their manipulative actions don\u2019t match their lofty words or promises. All of this can prove confusing. Seeing people as they are, instead of what you think they should be, would mean having a greater sense of their motives.","Most people don\'t have the patience to absorb their minds in the fine points and minutiae that are intrinsically part of their work. They are in a hurry to create effects and make a splash; they think in large brush strokes. Their work inevitably reveals their lack of attention to detail - it doesn\'t connect deeply with the public, and it feels flimsy.","The mighty lion toys with the mouse that crosses his path\u2014any other reaction would mar his fearsome reputation.","To the extent that we believe we can skip steps, avoid the process, magically gain power through political connections or easy formulas, or depend on our natural talents, we move against this grain and reverse our natural powers. We become slaves to time \u2013 as it passes, we grow weaker, less capable, trapped in some dead end career. We become captive to the opinions and fears of others. (9) \u201cThis intense connection and desires allows them to withstand the pain of the process \u2013 the self-doubts, the tedious hours of practice and study, the inevitable setbacks, the endless barbs from the envious.

He kept a court astrologer whom he admired, until one day the man predicted that a lady of the court would die within eight days. When the prophecy came true, Louis was terrified, thinking that either the man had murdered the woman to prove his accuracy or that he was so versed in his science that his powers threatened Louis himself. In either case he had to be killed. One evening Louis summoned the astrologer to his room, high in the castle. Before the man arrived, the king told his servants that when he gave the signal they were to pick the astrologer up, carry him to the window, and hurl him to the ground, hundreds of feet below. The astrologer soon arrived, but before giving the signal, Louis decided to ask him one last question: \u201cYou claim to understand astrology and to know the fate of others, so tell me what your fate will be and how long you have to live. \u201cI shall die just three days before Your Majesty,\u201d the astrologer replied. The king\u2019s signal was never given. The man\u2019s life was spared. The Spider King not only protected his astrologer for as long as he was alive, he lavished him with gifts and had him tended by the finest court doctors. The astrologer survived Louis by several years, disproving his power of prophecy but proving his mastery of power.\u201d","those who make a show or display of innocence are the least innocent of all.","Learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them.","You must be the mirror, training your mind to try to see yourself as others see you.","Think of the mind as a river: the faster it flows, the better it keeps up with the present and responds to change. The faster it flows, also the more it refreshes itself and the greater its energy. Obsessional thoughts, past experiences (whether traumas orsuccesses), and preconceived notions are like boulders or mud in this river, settling and hardeningthere and damming it up. The river stops moving; stagnation sets in. You must wage constant war on this tendency in the mind.","True ownership can come only from within. It comes from a disdain for anything or anybody that impinges upon your mobility, from a confidence in your own decisions, and from the use of your time in constant pursuit of education and improvement.","The dreamers, those who misread the actual state of affairs and act upon their emotions, are often the source of the greatest mistakes in history\u2014the wars that are not thought out, the disasters that are not foreseen","At your birth a seed is planted. That seed is your uniqueness. It wants to grow, transform itself, and flower to its full potential. It has a natural, assertive energy to it.

The stronger you feel and maintain it--as a force, a voice or in whatever form-- the greater your chance of fulfilling this Life\'s Task and achieving mastery.","Learn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them back. Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The momentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words will be outweighed by the price you pay.","In our culture we tend to equate thinking and intellectual powers with success and achievement. In many ways, however, it is an emotional quality that separates those who master a field from the many who simply work at a job. Our levels of desire, patience, persistence, and confidence end up playing a much larger role in success than sheer reasoning powers. Feeling motivated and energized, we can overcome almost anything. Feeling bored and restless, our minds shut off and we become increasingly passive.","When you have success, be extra wary. When you are angry, take no action. When you are fearful, know you are going to exaggerate the dangers you face.","Do not commit yourself to anybody or anything, for that is to be a slave, a slave to every man.... Above all, keep yourself free of commitments and obligations\u2014they are the device of another to get you into his power.... (Baltasar Graci\xe1n, 1601-1658) PART","Fear is the oldest and strongest emotion known to man, something deeply inscribed in our nervous system and subconscious. Over time, however, something strange began to happen. The actual terrors that we faced began to lessen in intensity as we gained increasing control over our environment. But instead of our fears lessening a well, they began to multiply in number. We started to worry about our status in society- whether people liked us, or how we fit into the group. We became anxious for our livelihoods, the future of our families and children, our personal health, and the aging process. Instead of a simple, intense fear of something powerful and real, we developed a kind of generalized anxiety.","Never appear overly greedy for attention, then, for it signals insecurity, and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are times when it is not in your interest to be the center of attention. When in the presence of a king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent thereof, bow and retreat to the shadows; never compete.","who can you trust?","Everything in life can be taken away from you and generally will be at some point. Your wealth vanishes, the latest gadgetry suddenly becomes pass\xe9, your allies desert you. But if your mind is armed with the art of war, there is no power that can take that away.

But a key component in the process is determining your mental and psychological strengths and working with them.To rise to the level of mastery requires many hours of dedicated focus and practice. You cannot get there if your work brings you no joy and you are constantly struggling to overcome your own weaknesses.You must look deep within and come to an understanding of these particular strengths and weaknesses you possess, being as realistic as possible. Knowing your strengths you can lean on them with utmost intensity. Once you start in this direction, you will gain momentum. You will not be burdened by conventions and you will not be slowed down by having to deal with skills that go against your inclinations and strengths.

On another level, however, we remain a nation that lives in social ghettos.

We grow afraid of entertaining new ideas and the effort that this requires. to think more flexibly entails a risk-we could fail and be ridiculed. We prefer to live with familiar ideas and habits of thinking, but we pay a steep price for this: our minds go dead from the lack of challenge and novelty; we reach a limit in our field and lose control over our fate because we become replaceable.","Anger is the most destructive of emotional responses, for it clouds your vision the most.","Do not think that what is hard for you to master is humanly impossible; and if it is humanly possible, consider it to be within your reach. \u2014MARCUS AURELIUS","Hesitation creates gaps. Boldness obliterates them.","As Nietzsche wrote, \u201cThe value of a thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays for it\u2014what it costs us. Perhaps you will attain your goal, and a worthy goal at that, but at what price? Apply this standard to everything, including whether to collaborate with other people or come to their aid. In the end, life is short, opportunities are few, and you have only so much energy to draw on. And in this sense time is as important a consideration as any other. Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of others\u2014that is too high a price to pay. Power\u201d","What draws attention draws power","Understand: we live in the world of a sad separation that began some five hundred years ago when art and science split apart.","Try to persuade a person by appealing to their consciousness, by saying outright what you want, by showing all your cards, and what hope do you have? You are just one more irritation to be tuned out.","Forgetting our objectives. \u2014During the journey we commonly forget its goal. Almost every profession is chosen and commenced as a means to an end but continued as an end in itself. Forgetting our objectives is the most frequent of all acts of stupidity. FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, 1844","There are very few men\u2014and they are the exceptions\u2014who are able to think and feel beyond the present moment. \xa0 CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, 1780-1831","skill and competence are far more important than friendly feelings.","little about your work, tease and titillate with alluring, even contradictory comments, then stand back and let others try to make sense of it all.","The Athenians were one of the most eminently practical people in history, and they made the most practical argument they could with the Melians: When you are weaker, there is nothing to be gained by fighting a useless fight. No one comes to help the weak\u2014by doing so they would only put themselves in jeopardy. The weak are alone and must submit. Fighting gives you nothing to gain but martyrdom, and in the process a lot of people who do not believe in your cause will die.","In the end, the money and success that truly last come not to those who focus on such things as goals, but rather to those who focus on mastery and fulfilling their Life\u2019s Task.","As Abraham Lincoln said, \u201cI don\u2019t like that man. I must get to know him better.","You are like a hunter: your knowledge of every detail of the forest and of the ecosystem as a whole will give you many more options for survival and success.","The vast majority of people conform to whatever is normal for the time.","At certain points in history it may be fashionable to be different and rebellious, but if a lot of people are playing that role, there is nothing different or rebellious about it.","the goal of an apprenticeship is not money, a good position, a title, or a diploma, but rather the transformation of your mind and character\u2014the first transformation on the way to mastery. You enter a career as an outsider. You are na\xefve and full of misconceptions about this new world. Your head is full of dreams and fantasies about the future. Your knowledge of the world is subjective, based on emotions, insecurities, and limited experience. Slowly, you will ground yourself in reality, in the objective world represented by the knowledge and skills that make people successful in it. You will learn how to work with others and handle criticism. In the process you will transform yourself from someone who is impatient and scattered into someone who is disciplined and focused, with a mind that can handle complexity. In the end, you will master yourself and all of your weaknesses.","Life has more meaning in the face of Death.","Your days are numbered. Will you pass them half awake and halfhearted or will you live with a sense of urgency?","The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift. \u2014ALBERT EINSTEIN","If everything in a dream were realistic, it would have no power over us; if everything were unreal, we would feel less involved in its pleasures and fears. Its fusion of the two is what makes it haunting.","The more Coriolanus said, the less powerful he appeared\u2014a person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot control himself, and is unworthy of respect.","Through continual exposure to people and by attempting to think inside of them we can gain an increasing sense of their perspective, but this requires effort on our part.","The need for certainty is the greatest disease the mind faces.","The key to staying unintimidated is to convince yourself that the person you\'re facing is a mere mortal, no different from you-- which is in fact the truth. See the person, not the myth. Imagine him or her as a child, as someone riddled with insecurities. Cutting the other person down to size will help your keep your mental balance.","In 1817 the twenty-two-year-old poet John Keats wrote a letter to his brothers in which he explained his most recent thoughts on the creative process. The world around us, he wrote, is far more complex than we can possibly imagine. With our limited senses and consciousness, we only glimpse a small portion of reality. Furthermore, everything in the universe is in a state of constant flux. Simple words and thoughts cannot capture this flux or complexity. The only solution for an enlightened person is to let the mind absorb itself in what it experiences, without having to form a judgment on what it all means. The mind must be able to feel doubt and uncertainty for as long as possible. As it remains in this state and probes deeply into the mysteries of the universe, ideas will come that are more dimensional and real than if we had jumped to conclusions and formed judgments early on. To accomplish this, he wrote, we must be capable of negating our ego. We are by nature fearful and insecure creatures. We do not like what is unfamiliar or unknown. To compensate for this, we assert ourselves with opinions and ideas that make us seem strong and certain. Many of these opinions do not come from our own deep reflection, but are instead based on what other people think. Furthermore, once we hold these ideas, to admit they are wrong is to wound our ego and vanity. Truly creative people in all fields can temporarily suspend their ego and simply experience what they are seeing, without the need to assert a judgment, for as long as possible. They are more than ready to find their most cherished opinions contradicted by reality.","A false path in life is generally something we are attracted to for the wrong reasons\u2014money, fame, attention, and so on. If it is attention we need, we often experience a kind of emptiness inside that we are hoping to fill with the false love of public approval.","Power is essentially amoral and one of the most important skills to acquire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil. Power is a game\u2014this cannot be repeated too often\u2014and in games you do not judge your opponents by their intentions but by the effect of their actions.","Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the gifts of his experience may direct rancor and ill will at you instead.","we tend to think of our behavior as largely conscious and willed. To imagine that we are not always in control of what we do is a frightening thought, but in fact it is the reality.","(The word \u201cgenius comes from the Latin, and originally referred to a guardian spirit that watched over the birth of each person; it later came to refer to the innate qualities that make each person uniquely gifted.)\u201d","While a friend expects more and more favors, and seethes with jealousy, these former enemies expected nothing and got everything. A man suddenly spared the guillotine is a grateful man indeed, and will go to the ends of the earth for the man who has pardoned him.","Seduction is a game of psychology, not beauty, and it is within the grasp of any person to become a master at the game. All that is required is that you look at the world","Our levels of desire, patience, persistence, and confidence end up playing a much larger role in success than sheer reasoning powers.","What offers immediate pleasure comes to seem like a distraction, an empty entertainment to help pass the time. Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, gaining fluency in skills, and experiencing the power this brings.","Space we can recover, time never. Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769-1821","Confidence is important, but if it is not based on a realistic appraisal of who you are, it is mere grandiosity and smugness.","As an apprentice, it can be hard for us to challenge ourselves on our own in the proper way, and to get a clear sense of our own weaknesses. The times that we live in make this even harder. Developing discipline through challenging situations and perhaps suffering along the way are no longer values that are promoted in our culture. People are increasingly reluctant to tell each other the truth about themselves\u2014their weaknesses, their inadequacies, flaws in their work. Even the self-help books designed to set us straight tend to be soft and flattering, telling us what we want to hear\u2014that we are basically good and can get what we want by following a few simple steps. It seems abusive or damaging to people\u2019s self-esteem to offer them stern, realistic criticism, to set them tasks that will make them aware of how far they have to go. In fact, this indulgence and fear of hurting people\u2019s feelings is far more abusive in the long run. It makes it hard for people to gauge where they are or to develop self-discipline. It makes them unsuited for the rigors of the journey to mastery. It weakens people\u2019s will.","Intellect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity.","The mind must not wander from goal to goal, or be distracted by success from its sense of purpose and proportion.","Remember: the greatest danger you face in the world today is that you are replaceable. As you get older, people who are younger, cheaper and more in tune with trends are rising up and threatening your position. Your only salvation is to mine your uniqueness, to combine various skills that set you apart. No one can do what you do. That is your endgame.","[Strategy] is more than a science: it is the application of knowledge to practical life, the development of thought capable of modifying the original guiding idea in the light of ever-changing situations; it is the art of acting under the pressure of the most difficult conditions. HELMUTH VON MOLTKE, 1800\u20131891","Do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can name great men of all kinds who were very little gifted. They acquired greatness, became \u201cgeniuses (as we put it), through qualities the lack of which no one who knew what they were would boast of: they all possessed that seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; they allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole. \u2014FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE\u201d","Second, many believe that by being honest and open they are winning people\u2019s hearts and showing their good nature. They are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instrument, which bloodies more than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to offend people; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or think. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so predictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you, and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions. If","The pain is kind of challenge your mind presents - will you learn how to focus and move past boredom, or like a child will you succumb to the need for immediate pleasure and distraction?","The people with money were meddling in mechanical and design affairs. They were interjecting their mediocre ideas into the process and polluting it.","Understand: your mind is weaker than your emotions. But you become aware of this weakness only in moments of adversity,precisely the time whenyou need strength. What best equips you to cope with tthe heat of battle is neither more knowledge nor more intellect. What makes your mind stronger, and more able to control your emotions, is internal discipline and toughness.No one can teach you this skill; you cannot learn it by reading about it. Like any discipline, it can come only through practice, experience, even a little suffering. The first step in building up presence of mind is to see the need for it, to want it badly enough to be willing to work for it.","a show or display of innocence are the least innocent of all. The only means to gain one\u2019s ends with people are force and cunning. Love also, they say; but that is to wait for sunshine, and life needs every moment. JOHANN VON GOETHE, 1749-1832","Making money or being successful should be a natural result of this ideal and not the goal itself.","Understand: as an individual you cannot stop the tide of fantasy and escapism sweeping a culture. But you can stand as an individual bulwark to this trend and create power for yourself. You were born with the greatest weapon in all of nature\u2014the rational, conscious mind. It has the power to expand your vision far and wide, giving you the unique capacity to distinguish patterns in events, learn from the past, glimpse into the future, see through appearances. Circumstances are conspiring to dull that weapon and render it useless by turning you inward and making you afraid of reality.Consider it war. You must fight this tendency as best you can and move in the opposite direction. You must turn outward and become a keen observer of all that is around you. You are doing battle against all the fantasies that are thrown at you. You are tightening your connection to the environment. You want clarity, not escape and confusion. Moving in this direction will instantly bring you power among so many dreamers.","Perhaps you are not trying to whip a crowd into a frenzy; you just want to bring people over to your side. Choose your strategy and words carefully. You might think it is better to reason with people, explain your ideas. But it is hard for an audience to decide whether an argument is reasonable as they listen to you talk. They have to concentrate and listen closely, which requires great effort. People are easily distracted by other stimuli, and if they miss a part of your argument, they will feel confused, intellectually inferior, and vaguely insecure. It is more persuasive to appeal to people\u2019s hearts than their heads. Everyone shares emotions, and no one feels inferior to a speaker who stirs up their feelings. The crowd bonds together, everyone contagiously experiencing the same emotions.","Just as a well-filled day brings blessed sleep, so a well-employed life brings a blessed death.","His moves intrigued her, each of them keeping her waiting for the next one\u2014she even enjoyed her jealousy and confusion, for sometimes any emotion is better than the boredom of security.","Mastery is not a function of genius or talent. It is a function of time and intense focus applied to a particular field of knowledge. But there is another element, an X factor that Masters inevitably possess, that seems mystical but that is accessible to us all. Whatever field of activity we are involved in, there is generally an accepted path to the top. It is a path that others followed, and because we are conformist creatures, most of us opt for this conventional route. But Masters have a strong inner guiding system and a high level of self-awareness. What has suited others in the past does not suit them, and they know that trying to fit into a conventional mold would only lead to a dampening of spirit, the reality they seek eluding them. And so inevitably, these Masters, as they progress on their career paths, make a choice at a key moment in their lives: they decide to forge their own route, one that others will see as unconventional, but that suits their own spirit and rhythms and leads them closer to discovering the hidden truths of their objects of study. This key choice takes self-confidence and self-awarenes\u2013the X factor that is necessary for attaining mastery...","Napoleon advised: Place your iron hand inside a velvet glove.","A fisherman in the month of May stood angling on the bank of the Thames with an artificial fly. He threw his bait with so much art, that a young trout was rushing toward it, when she was prevented by her mother. \u201cNever, said she, \u201cmy child, be too precipitate, where there is a possibility of danger. Take due time to consider, before you risk an action that may be fatal. How know you whether yon appearance be indeed a fly, or the snare of an enemy? Let someone else make the experiment before you. If it be a fly, he will very probably elude the first attack: and the second may be made, if not with success, at least with safety.\u201d She had no sooner spoken, than a gudgeon seized the pretended fly, and became an example to the giddy daughter of the importance of her mother\u2019s counsel. \xa0 FABLES, ROBERT DODSLEY, 1703-1764\u201d","Eventually, you will hit upon a particular field, niche, or opportunity that suits you perfectly. You will recognize it when you find it because it will spark that childlike sense of wonder and excitement; it will feel right. Once found, everything will fall into place. You will learn more quickly and more deeply . your skills level will reach a point where you will be able to claim your independence from within the group you work for and move out on your own. you will determine your circumstances. As your own Master, you will no longer be subject to the whims of tyrannical bosses or scheming peers.","The root cause of all passive aggression is the human fear of direct confrontation\u2014the emotions that a conflict can churn up and the loss of control that ensues.","To help yourself to cultivate serendipity, you should keep a notebook with you at all times. The moment any idea or observation comes, you note it down. You keep the notebook by your bed, careful to record ideas that come in those moments of fringe awareness\u2014just before falling asleep, or just upon waking.","If you come across any special trait of meanness or stupidity \u2026 you must be careful not to let it annoy or distress you, but to look upon it merely as an addition to your knowledge\u2014a new fact to be considered in studying the character of humanity. Your attitude towards it will be that of the mineralogist who stumbles upon a very characteristic specimen of a mineral. \u2014Arthur Schopenhauer","As Xenophon said, your obstacles are not rivers or mountains or other people; your obstacle is yourself.

This is the true sense of the maxim\u2014Live and let live\u2026. To become indignant at [people\u2019s] conduct is as foolish as to be angry with a stone because it rolls into your path. And with many people the wisest thing you can do, is to resolve to make use of those whom you cannot alter. \u2014ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER","In the course of your life you will be continually encountering fools. There are simply too many to avoid.We can classify people as fools by the following rubric: when it comes to practical life, what should matter is getting long term results, and getting the work done in as efficient and creative a manner as possible.That should be the supreme value that guides people\u2019s action. But fools carry with them a different scale of values.They place more importance on short-term matters \u2013 grabbing immediate money, getting attention from the public or media, and looking good. They are ruled by their ego and insecurities.They tend to enjoy drama and political intrigue for their own sake. When they criticize, they always emphasize matters that are irrelevant to the overall picture or argument.They are more interested in their career and position than in the truth. You can distinguish them by how little they get done, or by how hard they make it for others to get results.They lack a certain common sense, getting worked up about things that are not really important while ignoring problems that will spell doom in the long term.The natural tendency with fools is to lower yourself to their level.They annoy you, get under your skin, and draw you into a battle.In the process, you feel petty and confused. You lose a sense of what is really important.You can\u2019t win an argument or get them to see your side or change their behavior, because rationality and results don\u2019t matter to them.You simply waste valuable time and emotional energy.In dealing with fools you must adopt the following philosophy: they are simply a part of life, like rocks or furniture.All of us have foolish sides, moments in which we lose our heads and think more of our ego or short-term goals.It is human nature. Seeing this foolishness within you, you can then accept it in others.This will allow you to smile at their antics, to tolerate their presence as you would a silly child, and to avoid the madness of trying to change them.It is all part of the human comedy, and it is nothing to get upset or lose sleep over.","I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it\u2014and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.","Without a worthy opponent a man or group cannot grow stronger.","take special note of how people respond to stressful situations\u2014often the mask they wear in public falls off in the heat of the moment.","You can recognize deep narcissists by the following behavior patterns: If they are ever insulted or challenged, they have no defense, nothing internal to soothe them or validate their worth. They generally react with great rage, thirsting for vengeance, full of a sense of righteousness. This is the only way they know how to assuage their insecurities. In such battles, they will position themselves as the wounded victim, confusing others and even drawing sympathy. They are prickly and oversensitive. Almost everything is taken personally. They can become quite paranoid and have enemies in all directions to point to.","At your birth a seed is planted. That seed is your uniqueness. It wants to grow, transform itself, and flower to its full potential. It has a natural, assertive energy to it.

In these exercises you must strive to subtract your personal preferences and prejudices about people.","In all of these areas, the human brain is asked to do and handle more than ever before. We are dealing with several fields of knowledge constantly intersecting with our own, and all of this chaos is exponentially increased by the information available through technology. What this means is that all of us must possess different forms of knowledge and an array of skills in different fields, and have minds that are capable of organizing large amounts of information. The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways. And the process of learning skills, no matter how virtual, remains the same. In the future, the great division will be between those who have trained themselves to handle these complexities and those who are overwhelmed by them\u2014those who can acquire skills and discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media around them and can never focus enough to learn. The Apprenticeship Phase is more relevant and important than ever, and those who discount this notion will almost certainly be left behind. Finally, we live in a culture that generally values intellect and reasoning with words. We tend to think of working with the hands, of building something physical, as degraded skills for those who are less intelligent. This is an extremely counterproductive cultural value. The human brain evolved in intimate conjunction with the hand. Many of our earliest survival skills depended on elaborate hand-eye coordination. To this day, a large portion of our brain is devoted to this relationship. When we work with our hands and build something, we learn how to sequence our actions and how to organize our thoughts. In taking anything apart in order to fix it, we learn problem-solving skills that have wider applications. Even if it is only as a side activity, you should find a way to work with your hands, or to learn more about the inner workings of the machines and pieces of technology around you. Many Masters","We could express this power in the following way: Most of the time we live in an interior world of dreams, desires, and obsessive thoughts. But in this period of exceptional creativity, we are impelled by the need to get something done that has a practical effect. We force ourselves to step outside our inner chamber of habitual thoughts and connect to the world, to other people, to reality. Instead of flitting here and there in a state of perpetual distraction, our minds focus and penetrate to the core of something real. At these moments, it is as if our minds\u2014turned outward\u2014are now flooded with light from the world around us, and suddenly exposed to new details and ideas, we become more inspired and creative.","Every task you are given, no matter how menial, offers opportunities to observe this world at work. No detail about the people within it is too trivial. Everything you see or hear is a sign for you to decode. Over time, you will begin to see and understand more of the reality that eluded you at first. For instance, a person whom you initially thought had great power ended up being someone with more bark than bite. Slowly, you begin to see behind the appearances. As you amass more information about the rules and power dynamics of your new environment, you can begin to analyze why they exist, and how they relate to larger trends in the field. You move from observation to analysis, honing your reasoning skills, but only after months of careful attention.","In fact, the better you are at dealing with power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you become.","From a very early age Edison became used to doing things for himself, by necessity. His family was poor, and by the age of twelve he had to earn money to help his parents. He sold newspapers on trains, and traveling around his native Michigan for his job, he developed an ardent curiosity about everything he saw. He wanted to know how things worked\u2014machines, gadgets, anything with moving parts. With no schools or teachers in his life, he turned to books, particularly anything he could find on science. He began to conduct his own experiments in the basement of his family home, and he taught himself how to take apart and fix any kind of watch. At the age of fifteen he apprenticed as a telegraph operator, then spent years traveling across the country plying his trade. He had no chance for a formal education, and nobody crossed his path who could serve as a teacher or mentor. And so in lieu of that, in every city he spent time in, he frequented the public library. One book that crossed his path played a decisive role in his life: Michael Faraday\u2019s two-volume Experimental Researches in Electricity. This book became for Edison what The Improvement of the Mind had been for Faraday. It gave him a systematic approach to science and a program for how to educate himself in the field that now obsessed him\u2014electricity. He could follow the experiments laid out by the great Master of the field and absorb as well his philosophical approach to science. For the rest of his life, Faraday would remain his role model. Through books, experiments, and practical experience at various jobs, Edison gave himself a rigorous education that lasted about ten years, up until the time he became an inventor. What made this successful was his relentless desire to learn through whatever crossed his path, as well as his self-discipline. He had developed the habit of overcoming his lack of an organized education by sheer determination and persistence. He worked harder than anyone else. Because he was a consummate outsider and his mind had not been indoctrinated in any school of thought, he brought a fresh perspective to every problem he tackled. He turned his lack of formal direction into an advantage. If you are forced onto this path, you must follow Edison\u2019s example by developing extreme self-reliance. Under these circumstances, you become your own teacher and mentor. You push yourself to learn from every possible source. You read more books than those who have a formal education, developing this into a lifelong habit. As much as possible, you try to apply your knowledge in some form of experiment or practice. You find for yourself second-degree mentors in the form of public figures who can serve as role models. Reading and reflecting on their experiences, you can gain some guidance. You try to make their ideas come to life, internalizing their voice. As someone self-taught, you will maintain a pristine vision, completely distilled through your own experiences\u2014giving you a distinctive power and path to mastery.","Among his various possible beings each man always finds one which is his genuine and authentic being. The voice which calls him to that authentic being is what we call \u201cvocation. But the majority of men devote themselves to silencing that voice of the vocation and refusing to hear it.

Some people never become who they are; they stop trusting in themselves; they conform to the tastes of others, and they end up wearing a mask that hides their true nature. If you allow yourself to learn who you really are by paying attention to that voice and force within you, then you can become what you were fated to become\u2014an individual, a Master.\u201d","Every day you face battles\u2014that is the reality for all creatures in their struggle to survive.

That is how creativity is sparked and opportunities are seized. Knowledge, experience, and theory have limitations: no amount of thinking in advance can prepare you for the chaos of life, for the infinite possibilities of the moment. The great philosopher of war Carl von Clausewitz called this \u201cfriction: the difference between our plans and what actually happens. Since friction is inevitable, our minds have to be capable of keeping up with change and adapting to the unexpected.

It emanates from your individuality. It tells you which activities suit your character. And at a certain point, it calls you to a particular form of work or career.

You develop then a sense of your vocation.","But improvisation will only bring you as far as the next crisis, and is never a substitute for thinking several steps ahead and planning to the end.","Our levels of desire, patience, persistence, and confidence end up playing a much larger role in success than sheer reasoning powers.

Such types can remain lifelong friends and allies. But often the opposite will occur. They grow dependent on your services and want to keep you indentured. They envy your youth and unconsciously hinder you, or become overcritical. You must be aware of this as it develops. Your goal is to get as much out of them as possible, but at a certain point you may pay a price if you stay too long and let them subvert your confidence. Your submitting to their authority is by no means unconditional, and in fact your goal all along is eventually to find your way to independence, having internalized and adapted their wisdom.","In a world growing increasingly banal and familiar, what seems enigmatic instantly draws attention.

And these appearances are usually misleading.","Everyone holds his fortune in his own hands, like a sculptor the raw material he will fashion into a figure.

The longer they spent observing something, the deeper their understanding and connection to reality. With experience, their hunting skills would progress. With continued practice, their ability to make effective tools would improve.","Establishing your differences with the mentor is an important part of your self-development, whether he is of the good or bad parent type.","Inter action with boldness","KEYS TO WARFARE The world is full of people looking for a secret formula for success and power. They do not want to think on their own; they just want a recipe to follow. They are attracted to the idea of strategy for that very reason. In their minds strategy is a series of steps to be followed toward a goal. They want these steps spelled out for them by an expert or a guru. Believing in the power of imitation, they want to know exactly what some great person has done before. Their maneuvers in life are as mechanical as their thinking. To separate yourself from such a crowd, you need to get rid of a common misconception: the essence of strategy is not to carry out a brilliant plan that proceeds in steps; it is to put yourself in situations where you have more options than the enemy does. Instead of grasping at Option A as the single right answer, true strategy is positioning yourself to be able to do A, B, or C depending on the circumstances. That is strategic depth of thinking, as opposed to formulaic thinking.","To some people the notion of consciously playing power games\u2014no matter how indirect\u2014seems evil, asocial, a relic of the past. They believe they can opt out of the game by behaving in ways that have nothing to do with power. You must beware of such people, for while they express such opinions outwardly, they are often among the most adept players at power.","How can we explain such inclinations? They are forces within us that come from a deeper place than conscious words can express.They draw us to certain experiences and away from others.","when people overtly display some trait, such as confidence or hypermasculinity, they are most often concealing the contrary reality.","Spectacle and entertainment, clearly, are excellent devices to conceal your intentions, but they cannot be used indefinitely.

In fact, we come to believe that being critical of Masters or teachers is somehow a sign of our intelligence, and that being a submissive pupil is a sign of weakness.","Anger is the most destructive of emotional responses, for it clouds your vision the most. It","It has an edge because it is so different. Soon imitators pop up everywhere. It becomes a fashion, something to conform to, even if the comformity appears to be rebellious and edgy.

These include a sense of smugness and superiority whenever we encounter something alien to our ways, as well as rigid ideas about what is real or true, often indoctrinated in us by schooling or family. If we feel like we know something, our minds close off to other possibilities. We see reflections of the truth we have already assumed. Such feelings of superiority are often unconscious and stem from a fear of what is different or unknown. We are rarely aware of this, and often imagine ourselves to be paragons of impartiality.","The only real impediment to this is yourself and your emotions\u2014boredom, panic, frustration, insecurity. You cannot suppress such emotions\u2014they are normal to the process and are experienced by everyone, including Masters. What you can do is have faith in the process.","The boredom will go away once you enter the cycle. The panic disappears after repeated exposure. The frustration is a sign of progress\u2014a signal that your mind is processing complexity and requires more practice. The insecurities will transform into their opposites when you gain mastery.","Instead of spending your time dreaming of your plan\u2019s happy ending, you must work on calculating every possible permutation and pitfall that might emerge in it.","Even with skills that are primarily mental, such as computer programming or speaking a foreign language, it remains the case that we learn best through practice and repetition\u2014the natural learning process.","When Leonardo da Vinci wanted to create a whole new style of painting, one that was more lifelike and emotional, he engaged in an obsessive study of details. He spent endless hours experimenting with forms of light hitting various geometrical solids, to test how light could alter the appearance of objects. He devoted hundreds of pages in his notebooks to exploring the various gradations of shadows in every possible combination. He gave this same attention to the folds of a gown, the patterns in hair, the various minute changes in the expression of a human face. When we look at his work we are not consciously aware of these efforts on his part, but we feel how much more alive and realistic his paintings are, as if he had captured reality.","Strategic warriors operate much differently. They think ahead toward their long-term goals, decide which fights to avoid and which are inevitable, know how to control and channel their emotions. When forced to fight, they do so with indirection and subtle maneuver, making their manipulations hard to trace. In this way they can maintain the peaceful exterior so cherished in these political times.","Power depends on appearing larger than other people,","Lord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies. Voltaire, 1694-1778","When you have success, be extra wary. When you are angry, take no action. When you are fearful, know you are going to exaggerate the dangers you face. War demands the utmost in realism, seeing things as they are. The more you can limit or compensate for your emotional responses, the closer you will come to this ideal.","Power goes to those who end the revolution. Not the one who starts it.","As the great physicist Max Planck put it, scientists \u201cmust have a vivid intuitive imagination, for new ideas are not generated by deduction, but by an artistically creative imagination.","to the end, no matter what it is you are considering.

Any strong emotion and you will know that there\u2019s something boiling under the surface. Often the best way to get people to reveal themselves is to provoke tension and argument.","Read more books than those who have a formal education, developing this into a lifelong habit.","The only way to break out of a negative dynamic is to confront it. Repressing your anger, avoiding the person threatening you, always looking to conciliate\u2014these common strategies spell ruin. Avoidance of conflict becomes a habit, and you lose the taste for battle. Feeling guilty is pointless; it is not your fault you have enemies.","The character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily who you are; beyond the characteristics you have inherited, your parents, your friends, and your peers have helped to shape your personality. The Promethean task of the powerful is to take control of the process, to stop allowing others that ability to limit and mold them. Remake yourself into a character of power. Working on yourself like clay should be one of your greatest and most pleasurable life tasks. It makes you in essence an artist \u2014 an artist creating yourself.","What I fear is not the enemy\u2019s strategy but our own mistakes.","Love never dies of starvation, she wrote, \u201cbut often of indigestion.\u201d","Remember: You have only so much energy and so much time. Every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength.

OBSERVANCE","Too many people believe that everything must be pleasurable in life, which makes them constantly search for distractions and short-circuits the learning process. The pain is a kind of challenge your mind presents\u2014will you learn how to focus and move past the boredom, or like a child will you succumb to the need for immediate pleasure and distraction? Much as with physical exercise, you can even get a kind of perverse pleasure out of this pain, knowing the benefits it will bring you. In any event, you must meet any boredom head-on and not try to avoid or repress it. Throughout your life you will encounter tedious situations, and you must cultivate the ability to handle them with discipline.","At your birth a seed is planted. That seed is your uniqueness. It wants to grow, transform itself, and flower to its full potential. It has a natural, assertive energy to it. Your Life\u2019s Task is to bring that seed to flower, to express your uniqueness through your work.

But if you are mediocre ... you are better off learning from your predecessor\'s knowledge and experience, which are based on something real.","What limits individuals as well as nations is the inability to confront reality, to see things for what they are. As we grow older, we become more rooted in the past. Habit takes over. Something that has worked for us before becomes a doctrine, a shell to protect us from reality. Repetition replaces creativity.","According to Freud, seduction begins early in life, in our relationship with our parents. They seduce us physically, both with bodily contact and by satisfying desires such as hunger, and we in turn try to seduce them into paying us attention. We are creatures by nature vulnerable to seduction throughout our lives.","To be emperor of China was to be alone, surrounded by a pack of enemies\u2014it was the least powerful, least secure position in the realm.","Most often in culture we see people who short-circuit the Current. They observe some phenomenon in culture or nature that makes them emotional and they run rampant with speculations, never taking the time to entertain possible explanations that could have been verified by further observation. They disconnect themselves from reality and can then imagine whatever they want. On the other hand, we see many people, particularly in academia or in the sciences, who accumulate mountains of information and data from studies and statistics but never venture to speculate on the larger ramifications of this information or connect it all into a theory. They are afraid to speculate because it seems unscientific and subjective, failing to understand that speculation is the heart and soul of human rationality, our way of connecting to reality and seeing the invisible. To them, it is better to stick to facts and studies, to keep a micro view, rather than possibly embarrassing themselves with a speculation that could be wrong.","The child psychologist Jean Piaget saw conflict as a critical part of mental development. Through battles with peers and then parents, children learn to adapt to the world and develop strategies for dealing with problems. Those children who seek to avoid conflict at all cost, or those who have overprotective parents, end up handicapped socially and mentally. The same is true of adults: it is through your battles with others that you learn what works, what doesn\u2019t, and how to protect yourself. Instead of shrinking from the idea of having enemies, then, embrace it. Conflict is therapeutic.","In the stories of the greatest Masters, past and present, we can inevitably detect a phase in their lives in which all of their future powers were in development, like the chrysalis of a butterfly. This part of their lives\u2014a largely self-directed apprenticeship that lasts some five to ten years\u2014receives little attention because it does not contain stories of great achievement or discovery. Often in their Apprenticeship Phase, these types are not yet much different from anyone else.

They have called it genius and have thought of it as inaccessible. They have seen it as the product of privilege, inborn talent, or just the right alignment of the stars. They have made it seem as if it were as elusive as magic. But that wall is imaginary.","Your false self is the accumulation of all the voice you have internalized from other people-parents and friends who want you to conform to their ideas of what you should be like and what you should do, as well as societal pressures to adhere to certain values that can easily seduce you. It also includes the voice of your own ego, which constantly tries to protect you from from unflattering truths.","Eventually, the time that was not spent on learning skills will catch up with you, and the fall will be painful.","As a warrior in life, you must turn this dynamic around: make the thought of death something not to escape but to embrace. Your days are numbered. Will you pass them half awake and halfhearted or will you live with a sense of urgency?","If the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it, there is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you powerless, and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of struggling against the inevitable, instead of arguing and whining and feeling guilty, it is far better to excel at power. In fact, the better you are at dealing with power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you become. By following the route of the perfect courtier (see Law 24) you learn to make others feel better about themselves, becoming a source of pleasure to them. They will grow dependent on your abilities and desirous of your presence. By mastering the 48 laws in this book, you spare others the pain that comes from bungling with power\u2014by playing with fire without knowing its properties. If the game of power is inescapable, better to be an artist than a denier or a bungler.","The most important of these skills, and power\u2019s crucial foundation, is the ability to master your emotions. An emotional response to a situation is the single greatest barrier to power, a mistake that will cost you a lot more than any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing your feelings. Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly, you cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of control.","By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes.","To this day, we humans remain highly susceptible to the moods and emotions of those around us, compelling all kinds of behavior on our part\u2014unconsciously imitating others, wanting what they have, getting swept up in viral feelings of anger or outrage. We","So much of power is not what you do but what you do not do\u2014the rash and foolish actions that you refrain from before they get you into trouble. Plan in detail before you act\u2014do not let vague plans lead you into trouble.","we live in the world of a sad separation that began some five hundred years ago when art and science split apart. Scientists and technicians live in their own world, focusing mostly on the \u201chow of things. Others live in the world of appearances, using these things but not really understanding how they function. Just before this split occurred, it was the ideal of the Renaissance to combine these two forms of knowledge. This is why the work of Leonardo da Vinci continues to fascinate us, and why the Renaissance remains an ideal. This more rounded knowledge is in fact the way of the future, especially now that so much more information is available to all of us. As Calatrava intuited, this should be a part of our apprenticeship. We must make ourselves study as deeply as possible the technology we use, the functioning of the group we work in, the economics of our field, its lifeblood. We must constantly ask the questions\u2014how do things work, how do decisions get made, how does the group interact? Rounding our knowledge in this way will give us a deeper feel for reality and the heightened power to alter it.\u201d","The two board games that best approximate the strategies of war are chess and the Asian game of go. In chess, the board is small. In comparison to go, the attack comes relatively quickly, forcing a decisive battle.... Go is much less formal. It is played on a large grid, with 361 intersections \u2014 nearly six times as many positions as in chess.... [A game of go] can last up to three hundred moves. The strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly; the more complex the pattern your stones initially create on the board, the harder it is for your opponent to understand your strategy. Fighting to control a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have to think in larger terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually to dominate the board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility. With mobility you can isolate your opponent in small areas and then encircle them... Chess is linear, position oriented, and aggressive; go is nonlinear and fluid. Aggression is indirect until the end of the game, when the winner can surround the opponents\' stones at an accelerated pace.","Always try to lower the other side\u2019s sense of urgency. Make your enemies think they have all the time in the world; when you suddenly appear at their border, they are in a slumbering state, and you will easily overrun them. While you are sharpening your fighting spirit, always do what you can to blunt theirs. PART","Be like vapor. Do not give your opponents anything solid to attack; watch as they exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to cope with your elusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise your enemies \u2014 by the time they figure out where you are and what you are up to, it is too late.","Most people wait too long to go into action, generally out of fear. They want more money or better circumstances. You must go the opposite direction and move before you think you are ready. It is as if you are making it a little more difficult for yourself, deliberately creating obstacles in your path. But it is a law of power that your energy will always rise to the appropriate level. When you feel you must work harder to get to your goal because you are not quite prepared, you are more alert and inventive. This venture has to succeed so it will.","There are three kinds of time for us to deal with; each presents problems that can be solved with skill and practice. First there is long time: the drawn-out, years-long kind of time that must be managed with patience and gentle guidance. Our handling of long time should be mostly defensive\u2014this is the art of not reacting impulsively, of waiting for opportunity. Next there is forced time: the short-term time that we can manipulate as an offensive weapon, upsetting the timing of our opponents. Finally there is end time, when a plan must be executed with speed and force. We have waited, found the moment, and must not hesitate.","In the future, the great division will be between those who have trained themselves to handle these complexities and those who are overwhelmed by them\u2014those who can acquire skills and discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media around them and can never focus enough to learn.","Clearing your head of everything you thought you knew, even your mostcherished ideas, will give you the mental space to be educated by your present experience--the best schoolof all. You will develop your own strategic muscles instead of depending on other people\'s theories and books.","According to Machiavelli, human beings naturally tend to think in terms of patterns. They like to see events conforming to their expectations by fitting into a pattern or scheme, for schemes, whatever their actual content, comfort us by suggesting that the chaos of life is predictable.","Perhaps a more uncomfortable emotion is at the source\u2014such as envy or paranoia. You need to look at this square in the eye. Dig below any trigger points to see where they started. For these purposes, it might be wise to use a journal in which you record your Self-assessments with ruthless objectivity. Your greatest danger here is your ego and how it makes you unconsciously maintain illusions about yourself. These may be comforting in the moment, but in the long run they make you defensive and unable to learn or progress.","This mental habit offers excellent ground for deception, using a strategy that Machiavelli calls \u201cacclimatization\u2014deliberately creating some pattern to make your enemies believe that your next action will follow true to form.

Streamline the organization, cutting out waste\u2014in staff, in the irrelevant reports on your desk, in pointless meetings.","What you want in warfare is room to maneuver. Tight corners spell death. Having enemies gives you options. You can play them off against each other, make one a friend as a way of attacking the other, on and on. Without enemies you will not know how or where to maneuver, and you will lose a sense of your limits, of how far you can go. Early on, Julius Caesar identified Pompey as his enemy. Measuring his actions and calculating carefully, he did only those things that left him in a solid position in relation to Pompey. When war finally broke out between the two men, Caesar was at his best. But once he defeated Pompey and had no more such rivals, he lost all sense of proportion\u2014in fact, he fancied himself a god. His defeat of Pompey was his own undoing. Your enemies force on you a sense of realism and humility.","If you are trying to mislead your enemies, it is often better to concoct something ambiguous and hard to read, as opposed to an outright deception\u2014that deception can be uncovered and enemies can turn their discovery to their advantage, especially if you think they are still fooled and act under that belief.","Authority: One who is good at combating the enemy fools it with inscrutable moves, confuses it with false intelligence, makes it relax by concealing one\u2019s strength, . . . deafens its ears by jumbling one\u2019s orders and signals, blinds its eyes by converting one\u2019s banners and insignias, . . . confounds its battle plan by providing distorted facts. \u2014Tou Bi Fu Tan, A Scholar\u2019s Dilettante Remarks on War (16th century A.D.)","masterpieces of beauty, craftsmanship, and stability, all erected","Boldness ... is outer directed ... and makes others feel more at ease because it\'s less self-conscious.","Human tongue is a beast that few can master","To follow precisely the lead of others or advice from a book is self-defeating","Madness is the exception in individuals but the rule in groups.\u2014Friedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900)","it is always best to choose a task that is slightly above you, one that might be considered ambitious on your part.

An hour of Einstein\u2019s thinking at the age of sixteen does not equal an hour spent by an average high school student working on a problem in physics. It is not a matter of studying a subject for twenty years, and then emerging as a Master. The time that leads to mastery is dependent on the intensity of our focus.","Remember the following: Never take your position for granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head.

People hardly ever attack you openly anymore, showing their intentions, their desire to destroy you; instead they are political and indirect. Although the world is more competitive than ever, outward aggression is discouraged, so people have learned to go underground, to attack unpredictably and craftily. Many use friendship as a way to mask aggressive desires: they come close to you to do more harm. (A friend knows best how to hurt you.) Or, without actually being friends, they offer assistance and alliance: they may seem supportive, but in the end they\u2019re advancing their own interests at your expense.

You develop patience. Boredom no longer signals the need for distraction, but rather the need for new challenges to conquer.","We live in a world that seems increasingly beyond our control. Our livelihoods are at the whim of globalized forces. The problems that we face\u2014economic, environmental, and so on\u2014cannot be solved by our individual actions. Our politicians are distant and unresponsive to our desires. A natural response when people feel overwhelmed is to retreat into various forms of passivity. If we don\u2019t try too much in life, if we limit our circle of action, we can give ourselves the illusion of control. The less we attempt, the less chances of failure. If we can make it look like we are not really responsible for our fate, for what happens to us in life, then our apparent powerlessness is more palatable. For this reason we become attracted to certain narratives: it is genetics that determines much of what we do; we are just products of our times; the individual is just a myth; human behavior can be reduced to statistical trends.","Authority: I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than cautious, for fortune is a woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to master her, to conquer her by force; and it can be seen that she lets herself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who proceed coldly. And therefore, like a woman, she is always a friend to the young, because they are less cautious, fiercer, and master her with greater audacity. (Niccol\xf2 Machiavelli, 1469-1527) REVERSAL Boldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions.","In general, no matter your field, you must think of yourself as a builder, using actual materials and ideas. You are producing something tangible in your work, something that affects people in some direct, concrete way. To build anything well\u2014a house, a political organization, a business, or a film\u2014you must understand the building process and possess the necessary skills. You are a craftsman learning to adhere to the highest standards. For all of this, you must go through a careful apprenticeship. You cannot make anything worthwhile in this world unless you have first developed and transformed yourself.","Do not take so seriously people\u2019s promises or their ardor in wanting to help you. If they come through, so much the better, but be prepared for the more frequent change of heart. Rely upon yourself to get things done and you will not be disappointed.","On the internet, it is easy to find studies that support both sides of an argument. In general, you should never accept the validity of people\u2019s ideas because they have supplied \u201cevidence. Instead, examine the evidence yourself in the cold light of day, with as much skepticism as you can muster. Your first impulse should always be to find the evidence that disconfirms your most cherished beliefs and those of others. That is true science.\u201d","If you need everything in your life to be simple and safe, this open-ended nature of the task will fill you with anxiety. If you are worried about what others might think and about how your position in the group might be jeopardized, then you will never really create anything. You will unconsciously tether your mind to certain conventions, and your ideas will grow stale and flat.","Understand: we can never really experience what other people are experiencing. We always remain on the outside looking in, and this is the cause of so many misunderstandings and conflicts.","First, it is essential that you begin with one skill that you can master, and that serves as a foundation for acquiring others. You must avoid at all cost the idea that you can manage learning several skills at a time.","You see, you keep learning. People are always looking for a single magic turning point. There isn\'t one. It\u2019s much more of a gradual getting better and better and better and better.","The ultimate distinction you make is between yourself and the world. There is the inside (your subjective experience) and there is the outside. But every time you learn something, your brain is altered as new connections are formed. Your experience of something that occurs in the world physically alters your brain. The boundaries between you and the world are much more fluid than you might imagine.","Darwin could have played it safe, collecting what was necessary, and spending more time on board studying instead of actively exploring. In that case, he would not have become an illustrious scientist, but just another collector. He constantly looked for challenges, pushing himself past his comfort zone. He used danger and difficulties as a way to measure his progress. You must adopt such a spirit and see your apprenticeship as a kind of journey in which you will transform yourself, rather than as a drab indoctrination into the work world.","Power is essentially amoral and one of the most important skills to acquire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil.","Most people believe that they are in fact aware of the future, that they are planning and thinking ahead. They are usually deluded: What they are really doing is succumbing to their desires, to what they want the future to be. Their plans are vague, based on their imaginations rather than their reality. They may believe they are thinking all the way to the end, but they are really only focusing on the happy ending, and deluding themselves by the strength of their desire.","One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself. \u2014LEONARDO DA VINCI In","When it comes to mastering a skill, time is the magic ingredient. Assuming your practice proceeds at a steady level, over days and weeks certain elements of the skill become hardwired. Slowly, the entire skill becomes internalized, part of your nervous system. The mind is no longer mired in the details, but can see the larger picture. It is a miraculous sensation and practice will lead you to that point, no matter the talent level you are born with. The only real impediment to this is yourself and your emotions\u2014boredom, panic, frustration, insecurity. You cannot suppress such emotions\u2014they are normal to the process and are experienced by everyone, including Masters. What you can do is have faith in the process. The boredom will go away once you enter the cycle. The panic disappears after repeated exposure. The frustration is a sign of progress\u2014a signal that your mind is processing complexity and requires more practice. The insecurities will transform into their opposites when you gain mastery. Trusting this will all happen, you will allow the natural learning process to move forward, and everything else will fall into place.","The straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing. Kautilya, Indian philosopher, third century B.C. KEYS","Practical knowledge is the ultimate commodity, and is what will pay you dividends for decades to come\u2014far more than the paltry increase in pay you might receive at some seemingly lucrative position that offers fewer learning opportunities.","The great questions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions of majorities, but by iron and blood.","There is nothing to be gained by insulting a person unnecessarily. Swallow the impulse to offend, even if the other person seems weak. The satisfaction is meager compared to the danger that someday he or she will be in a position to hurt you.","His mind, he decided, worked best when he had several different projects at hand, allowing him to build all kinds of connections between them.","Because you think you have options, you never involve yourself deeply enough in one thing to do it thoroughly, and you never quite get what you want.

Sometimes you have to become a little desperate to get anywhere.","Un d\xeda, al ensayar una escena de El jard\xedn de los cerezos, su maestro de actuaci\xf3n, Michael Chekhov, le pregunt\xf3: \u201c\xbfPensabas en sexo mientras hicimos esta escena?.

It may make sense for some, but that does not mean it bears any relation to your own goals and destiny. You need to be patient enough to plot several steps ahead\u2014to wage a campaign instead of fighting battles. The path to your goal may be indirect, your actions may be strange to other people, but so much the better: the less they understand you, the easier they are to deceive, manipulate, and seduce. Following this path, you will gain the calm, Olympian perspective that will separate you from other mortals, whether dreamers who get nothing done or prosaic, practical people who accomplish only small things.","If there is any instrument you must fall in love with and fetishize, it is the human brain\u2014the most miraculous, awe-inspiring, information-processing tool devised in the known universe, with a complexity we can\u2019t even begin to fathom, and with dimensional powers that far outstrip any piece of technology in sophistication and usefulness.","When you find yourself in conflict with someone stronger and more rigid, allow them a momentary victory. Seem to bow to their superiority. Then, by being formless and adaptable, slowly insinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will catch them off guard, for rigid people are always ready to ward off direct blows but are helpless against the subtle and insinuating. To succeed at such a strategy you must play the chameleon\u2014conform on the surface, while breaking down your enemy from the inside.","the next time someone pushes you and you find yourself starting to react, try this: Do not resist or fight back, but yield,","For Pericles it would be nous, the ancient Greek word for \u201cmind or \u201cintelligence.\u201d Nous is a force that permeates the universe, creating meaning and order.

We may no longer have literal witch hunts, but in the twentieth century, not so very long ago, we witnessed the show trials of Stalin, the McCarthy hearings in the U.S. Senate, and the mass persecutions during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Various cults are continually being generated, including cults of personality and the fetishizing of celebrities. Technology now inspires religious fervor. People have a desperate need to believe in something and they will find it anywhere. Polls have revealed that increasing numbers of people believe in ghosts, spirits, and angels, in the twenty-first century.","It is a great folly to hope that other men will harmonize with us; I have never hoped this. I have always regarded each man as an independent individual, whom I endeavored to understand with all his peculiarities, but from whom I desired no further sympathy. In this way have I been enabled to converse with every man, and thus alone is produced the knowledge of various characters and the dexterity necessary for the conduct of life. \u2014JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE","it is natural to want to employ your friends when you find yourself in times of need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends soften the harshness. Besides, you know them. Why depend on a stranger when you have a friend at hand?The problem is that you often do not know your friends as well as you imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as not offend each other. They laugh extra hard at each others jokes. Since honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels.

If you keep chopping away at it, though, and do not let up, eventually, whether it wants to or not, it will suddenly topple down. When that time comes, you could round up everyone you could find and pay them to hold the tree up, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. It would still come crashing to the ground\u2026. But if the woodcutter stopped after one or two strokes of his axe to ask the third son of Mr. Chang, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this tree fall? And after three or four more strokes stopped again to ask the fourth son of Mr. Li, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this tree fall?\u201d he would never succeed in felling the tree.

For instance, we suddenly say something that offends our boss or colleague or friend\u2014we are not quite sure where it came from, but we are frustrated to find that some anger and tension from within has leaked out in a way that we regret.","Often the greatest obstacle to our pursuit of mastery comes from the emotional drain we experience in dealing with the resistance and manipulations of the people around us. If we are not careful, our minds become absorbed in endless political intrigues and battles. The principal problem we face in the social arena is our na\xefve tendency to project onto people our emotional needs and desires of the moment. We misread their intentions and react in ways that cause confusion or conflict. Social intelligence is the ability to see people in the most realistic light possible. By moving past our usual self-absorption, we can learn to focus deeply on others, reading their behavior in the moment, seeing what motivates them, and discerning any possible manipulative tendencies. Navigating smoothly the social environment, we have more time and energy to focus on learning and acquiring skills. Success attained without this intelligence is not true mastery, and will not last.","nobody likes to believe that they are operating under some kind of compulsion beyond their control. It is too disturbing a thought.","Persistence of little progress wins over brute force.","If you allow yourself to learn who you really are by paying attention to that voice and force within you, then you can become what you were fated to become\u2014an individual, a Master.

Seduction is a process that occurs over time\u2014the longer you take and the slower you go, the deeper you will penetrate into the mind of your victim. It is an art that requires patience, focus, and strategic thinking. You need to always be one step ahead of your victim, throwing dust in their eyes, casting a spell, keeping them off balance.","If they come from another culture, it is all the more important to understand this culture from within their experience.","Many men are intimidated by beauty and prefer to worship it from afar; others are drawn in, but not for the purpose of conversation. The Beauty suffers from isolation.","What separates Masters from others is often something surprisingly simple. Whenever we learn a skill, we frequently reach a point of frustration\u2014what we are learning seems beyond our capabilities. Giving in to these feelings, we unconsciously quit on ourselves before we actually give up.","What people lack in life is not more reality but illusion, fantasy, play.","Do not be afraid to exaggerate the role of willpower. It is an exaggeration with a purpose. It leads to a positive self-fulfilling dynamic, and that is all you care about.

The real thinker sees the connections, grasps the essence of the life force operating in every individual instance. Why should any individual stop at poetry, or find art unrelated to science, or narrow his or her intellectual interests? The mind was designed to connect things, like a loom that knits together all of the threads of a fabric. If life exists as an organic whole and cannot be separated into parts without losing a sense of the whole, then thinking should make itself equal to the whole.","One added benefit of making the opponent come to you, as the Japanese discovered with the Russians, is that it forces him to operate in your territory. Being on hostile ground will make him nervous and often he will rush his actions and make mistakes. For negotiations or meetings, it is always wise to lure others into your territory, or the territory of your choice.

The more people there are crowded into a space, the harder it becomes to thrive there. Working in such a field will tend to wear you out as you struggle to get attention, to play the political games, to win scarce resources for yourself. You spend so much time at these games that you have little time left over for true mastery. You are seduced into such fields because you see others there making a living, treading the familiar path. You are not aware of how difficult such a life can be.","Whistleblowers get fired and shot or crack up. You have to decide what you want to do. Do you want a career, or do you want to be an advocate? And where I\u2019ve been an advocate, I do it not in my backyard. If I\u2019m going to fight, I don\'t do it in the backyard. In other words, I can get more done by not doing it in the backyard.

There is a grain of truth and practicality in all of these efforts\u2014for instance, the emphasis in magic on deep focus. But in the end all of this searching is centered on something that doesn\u2019t exist\u2014the effortless path to practical power, the quick and easy solution, the El Dorado of the mind.","Being more careful is not what we need; that is just a screen for our fear of conflict and of making a mistake. What we need is double the resolve\u2014an intensification of confidence. That will serve as a counterbalance.","we can never really experience what other people are experiencing. We always remain on the outside looking in, and this is the cause of so many misunderstandings and conflicts. But the primal source of human intelligence comes from the development of mirror neurons (see here), which gives us the ability to place ourselves in the skin of another and imagine their experience. Through continual exposure to people and by attempting to think inside them we can gain an increasing sense of their perspective, but this requires effort on our part. Our natural tendency is to project onto other people our own beliefs and value systems, in ways in which we are not even aware. When it comes to studying another culture, it is only through the use of our empathic powers and by participating in their lives that we can begin to overcome these natural projections and arrive at the reality of their experience.","The misery that oppresses you lies not in your profession but in yourself! What man in the world would not find his situation intolerable if he chooses a craft, an art, indeed any form of life, without experiencing an inner calling?

As we continue to observe and follow the lead of others, we gain clarity, learning the rules and seeing how things work and fit together. If we keep practicing, we gain fluency; basic skills are mastered, allowing us to take on newer and more exciting challenges. We begin to see connections that were invisible to us before. We slowly gain confidence in our ability to solve problems or overcome weaknesses through sheer persistence.","5. Move toward resistance and pain A. Bill Bradley (b. 1943) fell in love with the sport of basketball somewhere around the age of ten. He had one advantage over his peers\u2014he was tall for his age. But beyond that, he had no real natural gift for the game. He was slow and gawky, and could not jump very high. None of the aspects of the game came easily to him. He would have to compensate for all of his inadequacies through sheer practice. And so he proceeded to devise one of the most rigorous and efficient training routines in the history of sports. Managing to get his hands on the keys to the high school gym, he created for himself a schedule\u2014three and a half hours of practice after school and on Sundays, eight hours every Saturday, and three hours a day during the summer. Over the years, he would keep rigidly to this schedule. In the gym, he would put ten-pound weights in his shoes to strengthen his legs and give him more spring to his jump. His greatest weaknesses, he decided, were his dribbling and his overall slowness. He would have to work on these and also transform himself into a superior passer to make up for his lack of speed. For this purpose, he devised various exercises. He wore eyeglass frames with pieces of cardboard taped to the bottom, so he could not see the basketball while he practiced dribbling. This would train him to always look around him rather than at the ball\u2014a key skill in passing. He set up chairs on the court to act as opponents. He would dribble around them, back and forth, for hours, until he could glide past them, quickly changing direction. He spent hours at both of these exercises, well past any feelings of boredom or pain. Walking down the main street of his hometown in Missouri, he would keep his eyes focused straight ahead and try to notice the goods in the store windows, on either side, without turning his head. He worked on this endlessly, developing his peripheral vision so he could see more of the court. In his room at home, he practiced pivot moves and fakes well into the night\u2014such skills that would also help him compensate for his lack of speed. Bradley put all of his creative energy into coming up with novel and effective ways of practicing. One time his family traveled to Europe via transatlantic ship. Finally, they thought, he would give his training regimen a break\u2014there was really no place to practice on board. But below deck and running the length of the ship were two corridors, 900 feet long and quite narrow\u2014just enough room for two passengers. This was the perfect location to practice dribbling at top speed while maintaining perfect ball control. To make it even harder, he decided to wear special eyeglasses that narrowed his vision. For hours every day he dribbled up one side and down the other, until the voyage was done. Working this way over the years, Bradley slowly transformed himself into one of the biggest stars in basketball\u2014first as an All-American at Princeton University and then as a professional with the New York Knicks. Fans were in awe of his ability to make the most astounding passes, as if he had eyes on the back and sides of his head\u2014not to mention his dribbling prowess, his incredible arsenal of fakes and pivots, and his complete gracefulness on the court. Little did they know that such apparent ease was the result of so many hours of intense practice over so many years.","Una mujer f\xe1cil de obtener no puede valer gran cosa.","If you feel lost and confused, if you lose your sense of direction, if you cannot tell the difference between friend and foe, you have only yourself to blame.","Half of your mastery of power comes from what you do NOT do, what you do not ALLOW yourself to get dragged into.","It is the height of stupidity to believe that in the course of your short life, your few decades of consciousness, you can somehow rewire the configurations of your brain through technology and wishful thinking, overcoming the effect of six million years of development.

This uniqueness is not something merely poetic or philosophical\u2014it is a scientific fact that genetically, every one of us is unique; our exact genetic makeup has never happened before and will never be repeated. This uniqueness is revealed to us through the preferences we innately feel for particular activities or subjects of study. Such inclinations can be toward music or mathematics, certain sports or games, solving puzzle-like problems, tinkering and building, or playing with words. With those who stand out by their later mastery, they experience this inclination more deeply and clearly than others. They experience it as an inner calling. It tends to dominate their thoughts and dreams. They find their way, by accident or sheer effort, to a career path in which this inclination can flourish. This intense connection and desire allows them to withstand the pain of the process\u2014the self-doubts, the tedious hours of practice and study, the inevitable setbacks, the endless barbs from the envious.

But it doesn\'t seem to me that it\u2019s a subject.","There is an art to asking for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person you are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs. Most people never succeed at this, because they are completely trapped in their own wants and desires. They start from the assumption that the people they are appealing to have a selfless interest in helping them. They talk as if their needs mattered to these people\u2014who probably couldn\u2019t care less. Sometimes they refer to larger issues: a great cause, or grand emotions such as love and gratitude. They go for the big picture when simple, everyday realities would have much more appeal. What they do not realize is that even the most powerful person is locked inside needs of his own, and that if you make no appeal to his self-interest, he merely sees you as desperate or, at best, a waste of time.","a state of balance\u2014a clear understanding of why we feel the way we do, conscious of our impulses so that we can think without being secretly compelled by our emotions.","what if we could look within and see the source of our more troubling emotions and why they drive our behavior, often against our own wishes?","People who are outwardly distant or shy are often better targets than extroverts. They are dying to be drawn out, and still waters run deep.","Lola pushed aside the sentries and entered his room anyway. In the process, the front of her dress somehow got torn (perhaps by her, perhaps by one of the sentries), and to the astonishment of all, most especially the king, her bare breasts were brazenly exposed. Lola was granted her audience with Ludwig. Fifty-five hours later she made her debut on the Bavarian stage; the reviews were terrible, but that did not stop Ludwig from arranging more performances.","Power has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at the game are the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will, keeping people off balance while they set the tempo. The essence of strategy is controlling what comes next, and the elation of victory can upset your ability to control what comes next in two ways. First, you owe your success to a pattern that you are apt to try to repeat.... Second, success tends to go to your head ...The powerful vary their rhythms and patterns, change course, adapt to circumstance, and learn to improvise.","Not just pain, but bullshit. Avoiding bullshit.","... good luck is more dangerous than bad luck.  Bad luck teaches valuable lessons about patience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you think your brilliance will carry you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn, and when it does you will be completely unprepared.","Your eyes must be on the larger trends that govern events, on that which is not immediately visible. Never lose sight of your long-term goals. With an elevated perspective, you will have the patience and clarity to reach almost any objective.","The infecting-character type is not restricted to women; it has nothing to do with gender.","You can recognize these supposed nonplayers by the way they flaunt their moral qualities, their piety, their exquisite sense of justice. But since all of us hunger for power, and almost all of our actions are aimed at gaining it, the nonplayers are merely throwing dust in our eyes, distracting us from their power plays with their air of moral superiority. If you observe them closely, you will see in fact that they are often the ones most skillful at indirect manipulation, even if some of them practice it unconsciously. And they greatly resent any publicizing of the tactics they use every day.","You do not belong to you. You belong to the Universe. Your significance will remain forever obscure to you, but you may assume that you are fulfilling your job if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the advantage of others.","Interactions with people are the major source of emotional turmoil, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. The problem is that we are continually judging people, wishing they were something that they are not\u2026 We want them to think and act a certain way, most often the way we think and act. And because this is not possible, because everyone is different, we are continually frustrated and upset. Instead, see other people as phenomena, as neutral as comets or plants. They simply exist. . . Work with what they give you, instead of resisting and trying to change them. Make understanding people a fun game, the solving of puzzles. It is all part of the human comedy.","the goal of an apprenticeship is not money, a good position, a title, or a diploma, but rather the transformation of your mind and character\u2014the first transformation on the way to mastery.","Charmers. First, they don\u2019t talk much about themselves, which heightens their mystery and disguises their limitations. Second, they seem to be interested in us, and their interest is so delightfully focused that we relax and open up to them. Finally Charmers are pleasant to be around. They have none of most people\u2019s ugly qualities\u2014nagging, complaining, self-assertion. They seem to know what pleases.","Self absorption is anti-seductive; it is a sign of insecurity.","You want to retain the elasticity of spirit you had as a child, interested in everything, while retaining the hard-nosed need to verify and scrutinize for yourself all ideas and beliefs.","The character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily who you are\u2026 The Promethean task of the powerful is to remake yourself into a character of power. Working on yourself like clay should be one of your greatest and most pleasurable life tasks. It makes you in essence an artist - an artist creating yourself.","In the face of the world\'s harshness and danger, organisms of any kind develop protection \u2014 a coat of armor, a rigid system, a comforting ritual. For the short term, it may work, but for the long term it spells disaster. People weighed down by a system and inflexible ways of doing things cannot move fast, cannot sense or adapt to change. They lumber around more and more slowly until they go the way of the brontosaurus. Learn to move fast and adapt or you will be eaten.The best way to avoid this fate is to assume formlessness. No predator alive can attack what it cannot see.","We think we are judging the younger generation in an objective manner, but we are merely succumbing to an illusion of perspective. It is also true that we are probably experiencing some hidden envy of their youth and mourning the loss of our own.","In the realm of power, you must ask yourself, what is the point of chasing here and there, trying to solve problems and defeat my enemies, if I never feel in control?","This means that you yourself are largely the agent of anything bad that happens to you. With more prudence, wiser policies, and greater vision, you could have avoided the danger. So when something goes wrong, look deep into yourself\u2014not in an emotional way, to blame yourself or indulge your feelings of guilt, but to make sure that you start your next campaign with a firmer step and greater vision.","When we are tired, it is often because we are bored. When no real challenge faces us, a mental and physical lethargy sets in. \u201cSometimes death only comes from a lack of energy, Napoleon once said, and lack of energy comes from a lack of challenges, comes when we have taken on less than we are capable of.\u201d","Throughout history we read of Masters in every conceivable form of human endeavor describing a sensation of suddenly possessing heightened intellectual powers after years of immersion in their field. The great chess Master Bobby Fischer spoke of being able to think beyond the various moves of his pieces on the chessboard; after a while he could see \u201cfields of forces that allowed him to anticipate the entire direction of the match. For the pianist Glenn Gould, he no longer had to focus on notes or parts of the music he was playing, but instead saw the entire architecture of the piece and could express it. Albert Einstein suddenly was able to realize not just the answer to a problem, but a whole new way of looking at the universe, contained in a visual image he intuited. The inventor Thomas Edison spoke of a vision he had for illuminating an entire city with electric light, this complex system communicated to him through a single image. In all of these instances, these practitioners of various skills described a sensation of seeing more. They were suddenly able to grasp an entire situation through an image or an idea, or a combination of images and ideas. They experienced this power as intuition, or a fingertip feel.\u201d","I got very good on the telephone tricks too. Like calling up a company and find out that the plant was going to building a new addition and getting hold of the engineering office and getting the secretary to give me the direct extension.","Years later, a Japanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his country\u2019s invasion of China. Mao interrupted, \u201cShould I not thank you instead? Without a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group cannot grow stronger.\u201d","Feeling bored and restless, our minds shut off and we become increasingly passive.","Once envy reveals itself for what it is, the only solution is often to flee the presence of the enviers, leaving them to stew in a hell of their own creation.","That is the power of formlessness \u2014 it gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to hit.","And the most common emotion of them all is the desire for pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Our thoughts almost inevitably revolve around this desire; we simply recoil from entertaining ideas that are unpleasant or painful to us. We imagine we are looking for the truth, or being realistic, when in fact we are holding on to ideas that bring a release from tension and soothe our egos, make us feel superior.","What withdraws, what becomes scarce, suddenly seems to deserve our respect and honor. What stays too long, inundating us with its presence, makes us disdain it.","The lesson is simple: it may be too late to be spoiled by a parent, but it is never too late to make other people spoil you. It is all in your attitude. People are drawn to those who expect a lot out of life, whereas they tend to disrespect those who are fearful and undemanding.","never spend so much time on your studies that you neglect your social skills.","It might be imagined that certain people in history\u2014the naturally gifted, the geniuses\u2014have either somehow bypassed the Apprenticeship Phase or have greatly shortened it because of their inherent brilliance. To support such an argument, people will bring up the classic examples of Mozart and Einstein, who seemed to have emerged as creative geniuses out of nowhere. With the case of Mozart, however, it is generally agreed among classical music critics that he did not write an original and substantial piece of music until well after ten years of composing. In fact, a study of some seventy great classical composers determined that with only three exceptions, all of the composers had needed at least ten years to produce their first great work, and the exceptions had somehow managed to create theirs in nine years. Einstein began his serious thought experiments at the age of sixteen. Ten years later he came up with his first revolutionary theory of relativity. It is impossible to quantify the time he spent honing his theoretical skills in those ten years, but is not hard to imagine him working three hours a day on this particular problem, which would yield more than 10,000 hours after a decade. What in fact separates Mozart and Einstein from others is the extreme youth with which they began their apprenticeships and the intensity with which they practiced, stemming from their total immersion in the subject. It is often the case that in our younger years we learn faster, absorb more deeply, and yet retain a kind of creative verve that tends to fade as we get older.","This is a brilliant application of the Law: Use surrender to gain access to your enemy. Learn his ways, insinuate yourself with him slowly, outwardly conform to his customs, but inwardly maintain your own culture. Eventually you will emerge victorious, for while he considers you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions against you, you are using the time to catch up and surpass him. This soft, permeable form of invasion is often the best, for the enemy has nothing to react against, prepare for, or resist. And had Japan resisted Western influence by force, it might well have suffered a devastating invasion that would have permanently altered its culture.","Make your targets afraid that you may be with-drawing, that you may not really be interested, and you arouse their innate insecurity, their fear that as you have gotten to know them they have become less exciting to you. These insecurities are devastating. Then, once you have made them uncertain of you and of themselves, reignite their hope, making them feel desired again. Hot and cold, hot and cold\u2014such coquetry is perversely pleasurable, heightening interest and keeping the initiative on your side. Never be put off by your target\u2019s anger; it is a sure sign of enslavement.","We live in a world that seems increasingly beyond our control. Our livelihoods are at the whim of globalized forces. The problems that we face\u2014economic, environmental, and so on\u2014cannot be solved by our individual actions.","The world wants to assign you a role in life and once you except that role you are doomed.","On July 2, 1960, a few weeks before that year\u2019s Democratic National Convention, former President Harry Truman publicly stated that John F Kennedy\u2014who had won enough delegates to be chosen his party\u2019s candidate for the presidency\u2014was too young and inexperienced for the job.","If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.","Pindar wrote, \u201cBecome who you are by learning who you are.","Money must circulate to bring power.","Power cannot accrue to those who squander their treasure of words.","The problem in trying to prove a point or gain a victory through argument is that in the end you can never be certain how it affects the people you\u2019re arguing with: They may appear to agree with you politely, but inside they may resent you.","THE BLIND HEN A hen who had lost her sight, and was accustomed to scratching up the earth in search of food, although blind, still continued to scratch away most diligently. Of what use was it to the industrious fool? Another sharp-sighted hen who spared her tender feet never moved from her side, and enjoyed, without scratching, the fruit of the other\u2019s labor. For as often as the blind hen scratched up a barley-corn, her watchful companion devoured it. FABLES, GOTTHOLD LESSING, 1729-1781","It is a disease to be obsessed by the thought of winning. It is also a disease to be obsessed by the thought of employing your swordsmanship. So it is to be obsessed by the thought of using everything you have learned, and to be obsessed by the thought of attacking. It is also a disease to be obsessed and stuck with the thought of ridding yourself of any of these diseases. A disease here is an obsessed mind that dwells on one thing. Because all these diseases are in your mind, you must get rid of them to put your mind in order.TAKUAN, JAPAN, 1573\u20131645","Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies\u2014that reveals insecurity, not confidence in your reputation.","At every step of the way, to give her the contrast she needed, Thatcher marked out an opponent: the socialists, the wets, the Argentineans. These enemies helped to define her image as determined, powerful, self-sacrificing. Thatcher was not seduced by popularity, which is ephemeral and superficial. Pundits might obsess over popularity numbers, but in the mind of the voter\u2014which, for a politician, is the field of battle\u2014a dominating presence has more pull than does likability. Let some of the public hate you; you cannot please everyone. Your enemies, those you stand sharply against, will help you to forge a support base that will not desert you. Do not crowd into the center, where everyone else is; there is no room to fight in a crowd. Polarize people, drive some of them away, and create a space for battle. Everything in life conspires to push you into the center, and not just politically. The center is the realm of compromise. Getting along with other people is an important skill to have, but it comes with a danger: by always seeking the path of least resistance, the path of conciliation, you forget who you are, and you sink into the center with everyone else. Instead see yourself as a fighter, an outsider surrounded by enemies. Constant battle will keep you strong and alert. It will help to define what you believe in, both for yourself and for others. Do not worry about antagonizing people; without antagonism there is no battle, and without battle, there is no chance of victory. Do not be lured by the need to be liked: better to be respected, even feared. Victory over your enemies will bring you a more lasting popularity.","The problem is that you often do not know your friends as well as you imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend each other. They laugh extra hard at each other\u2019s jokes. Since honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels. Friends will say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in clothes\u2014maybe they mean it, often they do not. When you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualities he or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of kindness that unbalances everything.","actively rebel against those forces that have pushed you away from your true path.","we tend to think of our behavior as largely conscious and willed. To imagine that we are not always in control of what we do is a frightening thought, but in fact it is the reality.

But as long as the project is going to come out, I never go over his head. Now, that\u2019s a rule I still follow today.","The feeling that we have endless time to complete our work has an insidious and debilitating effect on our minds. Our attention and thoughts become diffused. Our lack of intensity makes it hard for the brain to jolt into a higher gear. The connections do not occur. For this purpose you must always try to work with deadlines, whether real or manufactured. Faced with the slenderest amount of time to reach the end, the mind rises to the level you require. Ideas crowd upon one another.","Lincoln replied, \u201cdo I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends? KEYS TO POWER It is natural to want to employ your friends when you find yourself in times of need.\u201d","This means that you move toward challenges that will toughen and improve you, where you will get the most objective feedback on your performance and progress. You do not choose apprenticeships that seem easy and comfortable.","People\u2019s need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.

What happens in such a case is that you do not master the basics; you have no real vocabulary at your disposal.

They can learn from recent events, but they are easily distracted by what is in front of their eyes. Slowly, over a great period of time, our ancestors overcame this basic animal weakness. By looking long enough at any object and refusing to be distracted\u2014even for a few seconds\u2014they could momentarily detach themselves from their immediate surroundings. In this way they could notice patterns, make generalizations, and think ahead. They had the mental distance to think and reflect, even on the smallest scale.These early humans evolved the ability to detach and think as their primary advantage in the struggle to avoid predators and find food.

Practice absence: scarcity will increase your value.","Once envy eats away at someone, everything you do only makes it grow, and day by day it festers inside him. Eventually he will attack.","The problem is, when things go verbal, you drop out the detail.","The first step toward becoming rational is to understand our fundamental irrationality. There are two factors that should render this more palatable to our egos: nobody is exempt from the irresistible effect of emotions on the mind, not even the wisest among us; and to some extent irrationality is a function of the structure of our brains and is wired into our very nature by the way we process emotions.

But most often people are merely in a hurry, acting and reacting frantically to events, all of which makes them prone to error and wasting time in the long run. In order to separate yourself from the pack, to harness a speed that has devastating force, you must be organized and strategic. First, you prepare yourself before any action, scanning your enemy for weaknesses. Then you find a way to get your opponents to underestimate you, to lower their guard. When you strike unexpectedly, they will freeze up. When you hit again, it is from the side and out of nowhere. It is the unanticipated blow that makes the biggest impact.","Crush the enemy is a key strategic tenet of Sun-tzu, the fourth-century-B.C. author of The Art of War.

He knew less about the sea than did the average sailor on his ships, could never determine the latitude and longitude of his discoveries, mistook islands for vast continents, and treated his crew badly. But in one area he was a genius: He knew how to sell himself.","Thus for my own part I have more than once been deceived by the person I loved most and of whose love, above everyone else\u2019s, I have been most confident. So that I believe that it may be right to love and serve one person above all others, according to merit and worth, but never to trust so much in this tempting trap of friendship as to have cause to repent of it later on.

Every day you face battles\u2014that is the reality for all creatures in their struggle to survive. But the greatest battle of all is with yourself\u2014your weaknesses, your emotions, your lack of resolution in seeing things through to the end. You must declare unceasing war on yourself. As a warrior in life, you welcome combat and conflict as ways to prove yourself, to better your skills, to gain courage, confidence, and experience. Instead of repressing your doubts and fears, you must face them down, do battle with them. You want more chal-xx lenges, and you invite more war. You are forging the warrior\u2019s spirit, and only constant practice will lead you there.","Worship Athena, not Ares.","The feeling that we have endless time to complete our work has an insidious and debilitating effect on our minds. Our attention and thoughts become diffused. Our lack of intensity makes it hard for the brain to jolt into a higher gear. The connections do not occur. For this purpose you must always try to work with deadlines, whether real or manufactured.","Remember: When searching for suckers, always look for the dissatisfied, the unhappy, the insecure.

Such masters would beat their pupils and deliberately lead them to points of maximum doubt and inner tension, knowing such moments precede enlightenment.","What you know must translate into action, and action must translate into knowledge. In this way strategy becomes a lifelong challenge and the source of constant pleasure in surmounting difficulties and solving problems.","Warriors focus on what they do have, the strengths that they do possess and that they must use creatively. Knowing when to slow down, to renew, to retrench, they outlast their opponents. They play for the long term.","When you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the way to the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by the desire to improvise. Your clarity will rid you of the anxiety and vagueness that are the primary reasons why so many fail to conclude their actions successfully. You see the ending and you tolerate no deviation","No one likes feeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then, is to make your victims feel smart\u2014and not just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives.","The arrow shot by the archer may or may not kill a single person.

But with other people, we are quick to ascribe to them all kinds of Machiavellian tactics. This allows us to justify whatever we do, no matter the results.","Among his various possible beings each man always finds one which is his genuine and authentic being. The voice which calls him to that authentic being is what we call \u201cvocation. But the majority of men devote themselves to silencing that voice of the vocation and refusing to hear it. They manage to make a noise within themselves \u2026 to distract their own attention in order not to hear it; and they defraud themselves by substituting for their genuine selves a false course of life.\u201d","Your first task as a strategist is to widen your concept of the enemy, to include in that group those who are working against you, thwarting you, even in subtle ways.","Follow David\u2019s example: say or do something that can be read in more than one way, that may be superficially polite but that could also indicate a slight coolness on your part or be seen as a subtle insult. A friend may wonder but will let it pass. The secret enemy, though, will react with anger.","What weakens this force, what makes you not feel it or even doubt its existence, is the degree to which you have succumbed to another force in life - social pressures to conform. This counterforce can be very powerful. You want to fit into a group. Unconsciously, you might feel that what makes you different is embarrassing or painful. Your parents often act as a counterforce as well. They may seek to direct you to a career path that is lucrative and comfortable. If these counterforces become strong enough, you can lose complete contact with your uniqueness, with who you really are. Your inclination and desires become modeled on those of others.","It is estimated that over 65 percent of all human communication is nonverbal but that people pick up and internalize only about 5 percent of this information.","man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the luster of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. \u2014RALPH WALDO EMERSON","Experienced hunters do not choose their prey by how easily it is caught; they want the thrill of the chase, a life-and-death struggle\u2014the fiercer the better.","But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.","There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs\u2019 clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then\u2014never offend or deceive the wrong person.","Authority: The shortest and best way to make your fortune is to let people see clearly that it is in their interests to promote yours. (Jean de La Bruy\xe8re, 1645-1696)","Es mejor ser agredido o difamado que ignorado.","Going deeper into their Otherness, feeling what they feel, we can discover what makes them different and learn about human nature.","La v\xedctima perfecta no tiene facciones espec\xedficas o el mismo gusto musical que t\xfa, o metas similares en la vida. \xc9stos son los criterios del seductor banal para elegir a sus objetivos.

The idea that they might have to expend much effort to get what they want has been eroded by the proliferation of devices that do so much of the work for them, fostering the idea that they deserve all of this\u2014that it is their inherent right to have and to consume what they want.","The real purpose of the backward-glancing eye is to educate yourself constantly\u2014you look at the past to learn from those who came before you.","People with a lot of time on their hands are extremely susceptible to seduction. They have mental space for you to fill.","The spider has no need to chase for food, or even to move. It quietly sits in the corner, waiting for its victims to come to it on their own, and ensnare themselves in the web.","Remember: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances and irritations are contempt and disdain. Never show that something has affected you, or that you are offended\u2014that only shows you have acknowledged a problem. Contempt is a dish that is best served cold and without affectation.","Unfortunately there is no doubt about the fact that man is, as a whole, less good than he imagines himself or wants to be. Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual\u2019s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. \u2013Carl Jung","Creating this feeling of validation is the golden key that will unlock people\u2019s defenses. And we cannot survive and thrive in this highly competitive world without possessing such a power. We must discover the power that we can possess by giving people the validation they crave and lowering their defenses. And the key to making this happen in a realistic and strategic manner is to fully understand a fundamental law of human nature.","Una an\xe9cdota muy conocida sobre Kissinger se relaciona con un informe en el que Winston Lord hab\xeda trabajado durante d\xedas.

You will be assailed by varieties of hidden pain. Most often you deviate because of the lure of money, of more immediate prospects of prosperity. Because this does not comply with something deep within you, your interest will lag and eventually the money will not come so easily. You will search for other easy sources of money, moving further and further away from your path. Not seeing clearly ahead of you, you will end up in a dead-end career. Even if your material needs are met, you will feel an emptiness inside that you will need to fill with any kind of belief system, drugs, or diversions. There is no compromise here, no way of escaping the dynamic. You will recognize how far you have deviated by the depth of your pain and frustration.

In their own way, they are striving for fulfillment, but irrationally. By stepping back and imagining their story from the inside, Chekhov demythologized the brutes and aggressors; he cut them down to human size. They no longer elicited hatred but rather pity.","Los chinos tienen un proverbio: \u201cCuando el Yang est\xe1 en su fase ascendente, el Yin nace, lo que traducido a nuestro lenguaje quiere decir que cuando un hombre ha dedicado lo mejor de su vida a los asuntos ordinarios de la sobrevivencia, el Yin o lado emocional de su naturaleza sale a la superficie y reclama sus derechos.

The Qi general consulted the famous strategist Sun Pin (a descendant of Suntzu himself), who told him that the Wei general looked down on the armies of Qi, believing that their soldiers were cowards. That, said Sun Pin, was the key to victory. He proposed a plan: Enter Wei territory with a large army and make thousands of campfires. The next day make half that number of campfires, and the day after that, half that number again. Putting his trust in Sun Pin, the Qi general did as he was told. The Wei general, of course, was carefully monitoring the invasion, and he noted the dwindling campfires. Given his predisposition to see the Qi soldiers as cowards, what could this mean but that they were defecting? He would advance with his cavalry and crush this weak army; his infantry would follow, and they would march into Qi itself. Sun Pin, hearing of the approaching Wei cavalry and calculating how fast they were moving, retreated and stationed the Qi army in a narrow pass in the mountains. He had a large tree cut down and stripped of its bark, then wrote on the bare log, \u201cThe general of Wei will die at this tree. He set the log in the path of the pursuing Wei army, then hid archers on both sides of the pass. In the middle of the night, the Wei general, at the head of his cavalry, reached the place where the log blocked the road. Something was written on it; he ordered a torch lit to read it. The torchlight was the signal and the lure: the Qi archers rained arrows on the trapped Wei horsemen. The Wei general, realizing he had been tricked, killed himself. Sun Pin based his baiting of the Wei general on his knowledge of the man\u2019s personality, which was arrogant and violent. By turning these qualities to his advantage, encouraging his enemy\u2019s greed and aggression, Sun Pin could control the man\u2019s mind. You, too, should look for the emotion that your enemies are least able to manage, then bring it to the surface.

Was it triggered by something seemingly trivial or petty? That is a sure sign that something or someone else is behind it. Perhaps a more uncomfortable emotion is at the source\u2014such as envy or paranoia. You need to look at this square in the eye. Dig below any trigger points to see where they started. For these purposes, it might be wise to use a journal in which you record your self-assessments with ruthless objectivity. Your greatest danger here is your ego and how it makes you unconsciously maintain illusions about yourself. These may be comforting in the moment, but in the long run they make you defensive and unable to learn or progress. Find a neutral position from which you can observe your actions, with a bit of detachment and even humor. Soon all of this will become second nature, and when the Emotional Self suddenly rears its head in some situation, you will see it as it happens and be able to step back and find that neutral position.","... the moment when you stop has great dramatic import.

Late one winter afternoon he set out to visit a town that lay across the river from his own town. He was bringing some important books and papers with him and had commissioned a young boy to help him carry them. As the ferry neared the other side of the river, Chou Yung asked the boatman if they would have time to get to the town before its gates closed, since it was a mile away and night was approaching. The boatman glanced at the boy, and at the bundle of loosely tied papers and books\u2014\u201cYes, he replied, \u201cif you do not walk too fast.\u201d As they started out, however, the sun was setting.

He had one advantage over his peers\u2014he was tall for his age. But beyond that, he had no real natural gift for the game. He was slow and gawky, and could not jump very high. None of the aspects of the game came easily to him. He would have to compensate for all of his inadequacies through sheer practice. And so he proceeded to devise one of the most rigorous and efficient training routines in the history of sports. Managing to get his hands on the keys to the high school gym, he created for himself a schedule\u2014three and a half hours of practice after school and on Sundays, eight hours every Saturday, and three hours a day during the summer. Over the years, he would keep rigidly to this schedule. In the gym, he would put ten-pound weights in his shoes to strengthen his legs and give him more spring to his jump. His greatest weaknesses, he decided, were his dribbling and his overall slowness. He would have to work on these and also transform himself into a superior passer to make up for his lack of speed. For this purpose, he devised various exercises. He wore eyeglass frames with pieces of cardboard taped to the bottom, so he could not see the basketball while he practiced dribbling. This would train him to always look around him rather than at the ball\u2014a key skill in passing. He set up chairs on the court to act as opponents. He would dribble around them, back and forth, for hours, until he could glide past them, quickly changing direction. He spent hours at both of these exercises, well past any feelings of boredom or pain. Walking down the main street of his hometown in Missouri, he would keep his eyes focused straight ahead and try to notice the goods in the store windows, on either side, without turning his head. He worked on this endlessly, developing his peripheral vision so he could see more of the court. In his room at home, he practiced pivot moves and fakes well into the night\u2014such skills that would also help him compensate for his lack of speed. Bradley put all of his creative energy into coming up with novel and effective ways of practicing. One time his family traveled to Europe via transatlantic ship. Finally, they thought, he would give his training regimen a break\u2014there was really no place to practice on board. But below deck and running the length of the ship were two corridors, 900 feet long and quite narrow\u2014just enough room for two passengers. This was the perfect location to practice dribbling at top speed while maintaining perfect ball control. To make it even harder, he decided to wear special eyeglasses that narrowed his vision. For hours every day he dribbled up one side and down the other, until the voyage was done. Working this way over the years, Bradley slowly transformed himself into one of the biggest stars in basketball\u2014first as an All-American at Princeton University and then as a professional with the New York Knicks. Fans were in awe of his ability to make the most astounding passes, as if he had eyes on the back and sides of his head\u2014not to mention his dribbling prowess, his incredible arsenal of fakes and pivots, and his complete gracefulness on the court. Little did they know that such apparent ease was the result of so many hours of intense practice over so many years.","No good can ever come from deviating from the path that you were meant to follow","In the battle of the intelligent against the brutal and the aggressive, the surrender tactic is the supreme weapon.","acting is an art, not a gift from God.

Ford had apprenticed as a machinist and had worked on every conceivable device, but nothing could compare to his fascination with this new type of engine, one that created its own power. He envisioned a whole new kind of horseless carriage that would revolutionize transportation. He made it his Life\u2019s Task to be the pioneer in developing such an automobile. Working the night shift at the Edison Illuminating Company as an engineer, during the day he would tinker with the new internal-combustion engine he was developing. He built a workshop in a shed behind his home and started constructing the engine from pieces of scrap metal he salvaged from anywhere he could find them. By 1896, working with friends who helped him build a carriage, he completed his first prototype, which he called the Quadricycle, and debuted it on the streets of Detroit. At the time there were many others working on automobiles with gas-powered engines. It was a ruthlessly competitive environment in which new companies died by the day. Ford\u2019s Quadricycle looked nice and ran well, but it was too small and incomplete for large-scale production. And so he began work on a second automobile, thinking ahead to the production end of the process. A year later he completed it, and it was a marvel of design. Everything was geared toward simplicity and compactness. It was easy to drive and maintain. All that he needed was financial backing and sufficient capital to mass-produce it. To manufacture automobiles in the late 1890s was a daunting venture. It required a tremendous amount of capital and a complex business structure, considering all of the parts that went into production. Ford quickly found the perfect backer: William H. Murphy, one of the most prominent businessmen in Detroit. The new company was dubbed the Detroit Automobile Company, and all who were involved had high hopes. But problems soon arose. The car Ford had designed as a prototype needed to be reworked\u2014the parts came from different places; some of them were deficient and far too heavy for his liking. He kept trying to refine the design to come closer to his ideal. But it was taking far too long, and Murphy and the stockholders were getting restless. In 1901, a year and a half after it had started operation, the board of directors dissolved the company. They had lost faith in Henry Ford.","We humans like to imagine that we have an objective knowledge of the world. We take it for granted that what we perceive on a daily basis is reality\u2014this reality being more or less the same for everybody. But this is an illusion.

The relationship will often tend to fall apart from the misreading and miscommunications on both sides, and not aware of the source of this, we will go through precisely the same cycle with the next person.","Houdini for instance, could sometimes complete his escape acts in seconds\u2014but he drew them out to minutes, to make the audience sweat.","Muchas suspiran por el placer que huye / y aborrecen al que se les brinda; / insta con menos fervor / y dejar\xe1s de parecerle inoportuno. / No siempre han de delatar tus agasajos la esperanza / del triunfo; en ocasiones conviene que el amor / se insin\xfae disfrazado con el nombre de amistad. / He visto m\xe1s de una mujer intratable sucumbir / a esta prueba, y al que antes era / su amigo convertirse por fin en su amante.","The key to keeping the audience on the edge of their seats is letting events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right moment, according to a pattern and tempo that you control.","Remember : the role you were given in life is not the role you have to accept. You can always live out a role of your own creation, a role that fits your fantasy. Learn to play with your image, never taking it too seriously. The key is to infuse your play with the conviction and feeling of a child, making it seem natural. The more absorbed you seem in your own joy-filled world, the more seductive you become. Do not go halfway: make the fantasy you inhabit as radical and exotic as possible, and you will attract attention like a magnet.","This is The Primary Law of the Creative Dynamic that you must engrave deeply in your mind and never forget: your emotional commitment to what you are doing will be translated directly into your work.","The more mystery surrounds your actions, the more awesome your power seems. You appear to be the only one who can do what you do\u2014and the appearance of having an exclusive gift is immensely powerful. Finally, because you achieve your accomplishments with grace and ease, people believe that you could always do more if you tried harder. This elicits not only admiration but a touch of fear. Your powers are untapped\u2014no one can fathom their limits.","For, as Cicero says, even those who argue against fame still want the books they write against it to bear their name in the title and hope to become famous for despising it. Everything else is subject to barter: we will let our friends have our goods and our lives if need be; but a case of sharing our fame and making someone else the gift of our reputation is hardly to be found. Montaigne, 1533-1592","People trying to make a show of their authority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic. Your outward sign of submission makes them feel important; satisfied that you respect them, they become easier targets for a later counterattack, or for the kind of indirect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your power over time, never sacrifice long-term maneuverability for the short-lived glories of martyrdom.","The period after the inauguration became known as the \u201cHundred Days, and its success in altering the country\u2019s mood partly stemmed from Roosevelt\u2019s clever pacing and use of dramatic contrast.\u201d","Your false self is the accumulation of all the voices you have internalized from other people\u2014parents and friends who want you to conform to their ideas of what you should be like and what you should do, as well as societal pressures to adhere to certain values that can easily seduce you. It also includes the voice of your own ego, which constantly tries to protect you from unflattering truths. This self talks to you in clear words, and when it comes to mastery, it says things like, \u201cMastery is for the geniuses, the exceptionally talented, the freaks of nature. I was simply not born that way. Or it says, \u201cMastery is ugly and immoral. It is for those who are ambitious and egotistical. Better to accept my lot in life and to work to help other people instead of enriching myself.\u201d Or it might say, \u201cSuccess is all luck. Those we call Masters are only people who were at the right place at the right time. I could easily be in their place if I had a lucky break.\u201d Or it might also say, \u201cTo work for so long at something that requires so much pain and effort, why bother? Better to enjoy my short life and do what I can to get by.\u201d","Puedes jugar al gato y al rat\xf3n con \xe9l, primero pareciendo interesado y retrocediendo despu\xe9s, para incitarlo activamente a que te siga a tu telara\xf1a.

In fact seduction depends on mimesis, on the conscious creation of a mood or feeling that is then reproduced by the other person.

We observe something in the world that strikes our attention and makes us wonder what it might mean. In thinking about it, we devise several possible explanations. When we look at the phenomenon again we see it differently as we cycle through the various ideas we had imagined to account for it. Perhaps we conduct experiments to verify or alter our speculations. Now when we look at the phenomenon yet again, weeks or months later, we see more and more aspects of its hidden reality.","Doubt is a powerful weapon: Once you let it out of the bag with insidious rumors, your opponents are in a horrible dilemma.","(Sentir temor y peligro puede agudizar m\xe1s tarde la seducci\xf3n; pero si provocas esas sensaciones en las primeras etapas, lo m\xe1s probable es que ahuyentes a tu v\xedctima.)

Working off his ideas, which were sometimes quite wild, he would make models of things he imagined, and if they seemed at all feasible, he would proceed to invent prototypes of them. By actually translating his ideas into tangible objects, he could gain a sense of whether they were potentially interesting or merely ridiculous. Now his seemingly outlandish ideas were no longer speculations, but realities. He would then take his prototypes to another level, constructing artifacts for the public to see how they would respond.\u201d","The Lonely Leader. Powerful people are not necessarily different from everyone else, but they are treated differently, and this has a big effect on their personalities. Everyone around them tends to be fawning and courtierlike, to have an angle, to want something from them.

Lonely Leaders long to be seduced, to have someone break through their isolation and overwhelm them.","The Laws of Human Nature, 17: Seize the Historical Moment\u2014The Law of Generational Myopia","Finally, power itself always exists in concentrated forms. In any organization it is inevitable for a small group to hold the strings. And often it is not those with the titles. In the game of power, only the fool flails about without fixing his target.","In moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this desire to turn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out old allies and make new ones, force yourself into more and more different circles. This has been the trick of powerful people for centuries.","(Sentir temor y peligro puede agudizar m\xe1s tarde la seducci\xf3n; pero si provocas esas sensaciones en las primeras etapas, lo m\xe1s probable es que ahuyentes a tu v\xedctima.)

Adem\xe1s","Consider yourself a kind of archaeologist digging into your own past and that of your generation, looking for artifacts, for observations that you can piece together to form a picture of the underlying spirit. When you examine your memories, try to do so with some distance, even when you recall the emotions you felt at the time. Catch yourself in the inevitable process of making judgments of good and bad about your generation or the next one, and let go of them. You can develop such a skill through practice. Forging such an attitude will play a key role in your development.","To become indignant at [people\u2019s] conduct is as foolish as to be angry with a stone because it rolls into your path.","your weaknesses, your emotions, your lack of resolution in seeing things through to the end. You must declare unceasing war on yourself. As a warrior in life, you welcome combat and conflict as ways to prove yourself, to better your skills, to gain courage, confidence, and experience. Instead of repressing your doubts and fears, you must face them down, do battle with them.","This kind of feigned naturalness has countless applications in daily life, where nothing is more dangerous than looking smarter than the next person; the Natural pose is the perfect way to disguise your cleverness. But if you are uncontrollably childish and cannot turn it off, you run the risk of seeming pathetic, earning not sympathy but pity and disgust.","You must alter your attitude toward your own generation. We like to imagine that we are autonomous and that our values and ideas come from within, not without, but this is in fact not the case. Your goal is to understand as deeply as possible how profoundly the spirit of your generation, and the times that you live in, have influenced how you perceive the world.","It is a deadly but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting your gifts and talents, you are winning the master\u2019s affection. He may feign appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert.","[Strategy] is more than a science: it is the application of knowledge to practical life, the development of thought capable of modifying the original guiding idea in the light of ever-changing situations; it is the art of acting under the pressure of the most difficult conditions.","We could express this power in the following way: Most of the time we live in an interior world of dreams, desires, and obsessive thoughts. But in this period of exceptional creativity, we are impelled by the need to get something done that has a practical effect. We force ourselves to step outside our inner chamber of habitual thoughts and connect to the world. At these moments, suddenly exposed to new details and ideas, we become more inspired and creative. Once the deadline has passed or the crisis is over, this feeling of power and heightened creativity generally fades away. We return to our distracted state and the sense of control is gone. The problem we face is that this form of power and intelligence is either ignored as a subject of study or is surrounded by all kinds of myths and misconceptions, all of which only add to the mystery. We imagine that creativity and brilliance just appear out of nowhere, the fruit of natural talent, or perhaps of a good mood, or an alignment of the stars. It would be an immense help to clear up the mystery\u2014to name this feeling of power, and to understand how it can be manufactured and maintained. Let us call this sensation mastery\u2014the feeling that we have a greater command of reality, other people, and ourselves. Although it might be something we experience for only a short while, for others\u2014Masters of their field\u2014it becomes their way of life, their way of seeing the world. And at the root of this power is a simple process that leads to mastery\u2014one that is accessible to all of us. The process can be illustrated in the following manner: Let us say we are learning the piano, or entering a new job where we must acquire certain skills. In the beginning, we are outsiders. Our initial impressions of the piano or the work environment are based on prejudgments, and often contain an element of fear. When we first study the piano, the keyboard looks rather intimidating\u2014we don\u2019t understand the relationships between the keys, the chords, the pedals, and everything else that goes into creating music. In a new job situation, we are ignorant of the power relationships between people, the psychology of our boss, the rules and procedures that are considered critical for success. We are confused\u2014the knowledge we need in both cases is over our heads. Although we might enter these situations with excitement about what we can learn or do with our new skills, we quickly realize how much hard work there is ahead of us. The great danger is that we give in to feelings of boredom, impatience, fear, and confusion. We stop observing and learning. The process comes to a halt. If, on the other hand, we manage these emotions and allow time to take its course, something remarkable begins to take shape. As we continue to observe and follow the lead of others, we gain clarity, learning the rules and seeing how things work and fit together. If we keep practicing, we gain fluency; basic skills are mastered, allowing us to take on newer and more exciting challenges.","No te dejes enga\xf1ar por la reprobaci\xf3n superficial que tu actitud de dandy puede provocar.

The problem is that we are generally too self-absorbed: We think more about what we want from others than what they could want from us. We may occasionally do something that is seductive, but often we follow this up with a selfish or aggressive action (we are in a hurry to get what we want); or, unaware of what we are doing, we show a side of ourselves that is petty and banal, deflating any illusions or fantasies a person might have about us.

That is what happened to Lyndon Johnson once he attained a position of ultimate security in the Senate, as Senate majority leader. Tired of the years he had to spend playing the perfect courtier, he now relished the power he had to upset or humiliate those who had crossed him in the past. Now he would go up to such a senator and make a point of talking only to his assistant. Or he would get up and leave the floor when a senator he did not like was giving an important speech, making other senators follow him. In general there are always signs of these character traits in the past if you look closely enough (Johnson had revealed such nasty signs in the earliest parts of his political career), but, more important, you need to take notice of what people reveal once they are in power.

Yes, people are irrational, but so are you. Make your acceptance of human nature as radical as possible. This will calm you down and help you observe people more dispassionately, understanding them on a deeper level. You will stop projecting your own emotions on to them. All of this will give you more balance and calmness, more mental space for thinking.","impetuosity,","The ancient Greeks had an appropriate metaphor for this: the rider and the horse. The horse is our emotional nature continually impelling us to move. This horse has tremendous energy and power, but without a rider it cannot be guided; it is wild, subject to predators, and continually heading into trouble. The rider is our thinking self. Through training and practice, it holds the reins and guides the horse, transforming this powerful animal energy into something productive. The one without the other is useless. Without the rider, no directed movement or purpose. Without the horse, no energy, no power. In most people the horse dominates, and the rider is weak. In some people the rider is too strong, holds the reins too tightly, and is afraid to occasionally let the animal go into a gallop. The horse and rider must work together. This means we consider our actions beforehand; we bring as much thinking as possible to a situation before we make a decision. But once we decide what to do, we loosen the reins and enter action with boldness and a spirit of adventure. Instead of being slaves to this energy, we channel it. That is the essence of rationality. As an example of this ideal in action, try to maintain a perfect balance between skepticism (rider) and curiosity (horse). In this mode you are skeptical about your own enthusiasms and those of others. You do not accept at face value people\u2019s explanations and their application of \u201cevidence. You look at the results of their actions, not what they say about their motivations. But if you take this too far, your mind will close itself off from wild ideas, from exciting speculations, from curiosity itself. You want to retain the elasticity of spirit you had as a child, interested in everything, while retaining the hard-nosed need to verify and scrutinize for yourself all ideas and beliefs. The two can coexist. It is a balance that all geniuses possess.\u201d","Las mujeres [narcisistas] son las que m\xe1s fascinan a los hombres.","Daily Law: Examine the faults you see in others and how they are in you as well.","Third and most important, we must begin to make the transformation into the healthy narcissist.

During the run-up to the 1929 crash on Wall Street, many people had become addicted to playing the stock market, and this addiction had a physical component\u2014the sound of the ticker tape that electronically registered each change in a stock\u2019s price. Hearing that clicking noise indicated something was happening, somebody was trading and making a fortune. Many felt drawn to the sound itself, which felt like the heartbeat of Wall Street. We no longer have the ticker tape. Instead many of us have become addicted to the minute-by-minute news cycle, to \u201cwhat\u2019s trending, to the Twitter feed, which is often accompanied by a ping that has its own narcotic effects. We feel like we are connected to the very flow of life itself, to events as they change in real time, and to other people who are following the same instant reports. This need to know instantly has a built-in momentum. Once we expect to have some bit of news quickly, we can never go back to the slower pace of just a year ago.

That is the same as fighting the last war: instead of responding to the moment, they relied on training, technology, and what had worked before. Musashi, who had grasped the essence of strategy when he was still very young, turned their rigidity into their downfall. His first thought was of the gambit that would take this particular opponent most by surprise. Then he would anchor himself in the moment: having set his opponent off balance with something unexpected, he would watch carefully, then respond with another action, usually improvised, that would turn mere disequilibrium into defeat and death.","Recuerda mantener distancia emocional y f\xedsica.

Deprived of a reason to get angry, your opponents will often be bewildered instead.","It is hard for us to imagine now, but our earliest human ancestors who ventured out onto the grasslands of East Africa some six million years ago were remarkably weak and vulnerable creatures. They stood less than five feet tall. They walked upright and could run on their two legs, but nowhere near as fast as the swift predators on four legs that pursued them. They were skinny\u2014their arms could not provide much defense. They had no claws or fangs or poison to resort to if under attack. To gather fruits, nuts, and insects, or to scavenge dead meat, they had to move out into the open savanna where they became easy prey to leopards or packs of hyenas. So weak and small in number, they might have easily become extinct.And yet within the space of a few million years (remarkably short on the time scale of evolution), these rather physically unimpressive ancestors of ours transformed themselves into the most formidable hunters on the planet. What could possibly account for such a miraculous turnaround?","Men of great abilities are slow to act. for it is easier to avoid occasions for committing yourself than to come well out of a commitment.

And this knowledge is not about how to be more forceful in getting what we want or defending ourselves but rather how to be more rational and strategic when it comes to conflict, channeling our aggressive impulses instead of denying or repressing them. If there is an ideal to aim for, it should be that of the strategic warrior, the man or woman who manages difficult situations and people through deft and intelligent maneuver.","We like to present a particular appearance to the world, one that highlights our strengths. When in love, however, opposite traits often come to the fore. A person who is normally strong and independent can suddenly become rather helpless, dependent, and hysterical. A nurturing, empathetic person can suddenly become tyrannical, demanding, and self-absorbed. As adults we feel relatively mature and practical, but in love we can suddenly regress to behavior that can only be seen as childish. We experience fears and insecurities that are greatly exaggerated. We feel terror at the thought of being abandoned, like a baby who has been left alone for a few minutes. We have wild mood swings\u2014from love to hate, from trust to paranoia. Normally we like to imagine that we are good judges of other people\u2019s character. Once infatuated or in love, however, we mistake the narcissist for a genius, the suffocator for a nurturer, the slacker for the exciting rebel, the control freak for the protector. Others can often see the truth and try to disabuse us of our fantasies, but we won\u2019t listen. And what is worse, we will often continue to make the same types of mistaken judgments again and again.","Experimenting with the skills and options related to your personality and inclinations is not only the single most essential step in developing a high sense of purpose, it is perhaps the most important step in life in general.","In some people the rider is too strong, holds the reins too tightly, and is afraid to occasionally let the animal go into a gallop.","As women come to attain more leadership positions, this less obtrusive style of authority might begin to alter our perception of some of the dominance cues so long associated with power.","In the process leading to this ultimate form of power, we can identify three distinct phases or levels.

To move quickly and efficiently in such a world, they developed extremely sophisticated eye and muscle coordination. Their eyes slowly evolved into a full-frontal position on the face, giving them binocular, stereoscopic vision. This system provides the brain a highly accurate three-dimensional and detailed perspective, but is rather narrow. Animals that possess such vision\u2014as opposed to eyes on the side or half side\u2014are generally efficient predators like owls or cats. They use this powerful sight to home in on prey in the distance. Tree-living primates evolved this vision for a different purpose\u2014to navigate branches, and to spot fruits, berries, and insects with greater effectiveness. They also evolved elaborate color vision.","Brecht, on the other hand, who had actually worked steadfastly for the Communist cause, played the opposite game: He answered questions with ambiguous generalities that defied easy interpretation.

To solve this they offered a reward for every dead cobra residents would bring in. Soon enterprising locals began to breed cobras in order to make a living from the bounty. The government caught on to this and canceled the program. The breeders, resentful of the rulers and angered by their actions, decided to release their cobras back on the streets, thereby tripling the population from before the government program.","One of the most potent weapons in the battle for information, then, is giving out false information. As Winston Churchill said, \u201cTruth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.","Nuestra \xe9poca puede enfatizar la igualdad, que luego confundimos con la necesidad de que todos seamos id\xe9nticos, pero su verdadero significado es la igualdad de oportunidades para expresar nuestras diferencias,","Alfonso I of Aragon once had a servant who told the king that the night before he had had a dream: Alfonso had given him a gift of weapons, horses, and clothes. Alfonso, a generous, lordly man, decided it would be amusing to make this dream come true, and promptly gave the servant exactly these gifts. A little while later, the same servant announced to Alfonso that he had had yet another dream, and in this one Alfonso had given him a considerable pile of gold florins. The king smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t believe in dreams from now on; they lie.","If you run away or fight back, in the long run you cannot win. If you surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious.","Without any visual cues or any action on the part of others, we can place ourselves inside their minds and imagine what they might be thinking.","Es una sencilla ley de la psicolog\xeda humana que tus pensamientos tender\xe1n a girar en torno a lo que m\xe1s valoras.

Possessing already this powerful visual system, they could see far into the distance (giraffes and elephants might stand taller, but their eyes are on the sides, giving them instead panoramic vision). This allowed them to spot dangerous predators far away on the horizon and detect their movements even in twilight. Given a few seconds or minutes, they could plot a safe retreat. At the same time, if they focused on what was nearest at hand, they could identify all kinds of important details in their environment\u2014footprints and signs of passing predators, or the colors and shapes of rocks that they could pick up and perhaps use as tools.","And as with Louis, he will not admit the truth, but will find an excuse to rid himself of your presence.","People trying to make a show of their authority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic.","If, like Jung, you are somewhat confused and ambivalent about your direction, it can be useful to choose someone who can help you gain some clarity about what you want, someone important in the field who might not fit perfectly with your tastes.","The only solution is the following: We must learn how to quiet the anxiety we feel whenever we are confronted with anything that seems complex or chaotic. In our journey from apprenticeship to mastery we must patiently learn the various parts and skills that are required, never looking too far ahead. In moments of perceived crisis, we must develop the habit of maintaining our cool and never overreacting.","Primero, debes tener una presencia tan desbordante que llene la mente de tu objetivo como un close-up llena la pantalla.

On the open grassland, it was the opposite. Safety and finding food relied upon slow, patient observation of the environment, on the ability to pick out details and focus on what they might mean. Our ancestors\u2019 survival depended on the intensity of their attention. The longer and harder they looked, the more they could distinguish between an opportunity and a danger. If they simply scanned the horizon quickly they could see a lot more, but this would overload the mind with information\u2014too many details for such sharp vision. The human visual system is not built for scanning, as a cow\u2019s is, but for depth of focus.","There are nine seducer types in the world. Each type has a particular character trait that comes from deep within and creates a seductive pull. Sirens have an abundance of sexual energy and know how to use it. Rakes insatiably adore the opposite sex, and their desire is infectious. Ideal Lovers have an aesthetic sensibility that they apply to romance. Dandies like to play with their image, creating a striking and androgynous allure. Naturals are spontaneous and open. Coquettes are self-sufficient, with a fascinating cool at their core. Charmers want and know how to please\u2014they are social creatures. Charismatics have an unusual confidence in themselves. Stars are ethereal and envelop themselves in mystery.","But true Zen never stops, never congeals into such truths. That is why everyone must constantly be pushed to the abyss, starting over and feeling their utter worthlessness as a student. Without suffering and doubts, the mind will come to rest on clich\xe9s and stay there, until the spirit dies as well. Not even enlightenment is enough.

He was appealing to their notorious narcissism.","In dealing with fools you must adopt the following philosophy: they are simply a part of life, like rocks or furniture. All of us have foolish sides, moments in which we lose our heads and think more of our ego or short-term goals. It is human nature.

They became good, obedient boys, excellent students at school. Consciously they are attracted to well-educated women, to those who seem good and perfect. But unconsciously they are drawn to women who are imperfect, bad, of dubious character. They secretly crave what is the opposite of themselves. It is the classic split of the mother/whore\u2014they want the mother figure for a wife but feel a much stronger physical attraction to the whore, the Fallen Woman, the type who likes to display her body. They have repressed the playful, sensual, and earthy sides of the character they had as boys. They are too rigid and civilized. The only way they can relate to these qualities is through women who appear to be so different from themselves. Like Swann, they find a way to idealize them with some highbrow reference that has no relation to reality. They project onto such women weakness and vulnerability.

T\xc1CITO, ca. 55-120 d.C.","Generational Patterns Since the beginning of recorded time, certain writers and thinkers have intuited a pattern to human history. It was perhaps the great fourteenth-century Islamic scholar Ibn Khaldun who first formulated this idea into the theory that history seems to move in four acts, corresponding to four generations. The first generation is that of the revolutionaries who make a radical break with the past, establishing new values but also creating some chaos in the struggle to do so. Often in this generation there are some great leaders or prophets who influence the direction of the revolution and leave their stamp on it. Then along comes a second generation that craves some order. They are still feeling the heat of the revolution itself, having lived through it at a very early age, but they want to stabilize the world, establish some conventions and dogma. Those of the third generation\u2014having little direct connection to the founders of the revolution\u2014feel less passionate about it. They are pragmatists. They want to solve problems and make life as comfortable as possible. They are not so interested in ideas but rather in building things. In the process, they tend to drain out the spirit of the original revolution. Material concerns predominate, and people can become quite individualistic. Along comes the fourth generation, which feels that society has lost its vitality, but they are not sure what should replace it. They begin to question the values they have inherited, some becoming quite cynical. Nobody knows what to believe in anymore. A crisis of sorts emerges. Then comes the revolutionary generation, which, unified around some new belief, finally tears down the old order, and the cycle continues. This revolution can be extreme and violent, or it can be less intense, with simply the emergence of new and different values.","We all naturally possess the most remarkable tool for connecting to people and attaining social power\u2014empathy. When cultivated and properly used, it can allow us to see into the moods and minds of others, giving us the power to anticipate people\u2019s actions and gently lower their resistance. This instrument, however, is blunted by our habitual self-absorption. We are all narcissists, some deeper on the spectrum than others. Our mission in life is to come to terms with this self-love and learn how to turn our sensitivity outward, toward others, instead of inward. We must recognize at the same time the toxic narcissists among us before getting enmeshed in their dramas and poisoned by their envy.","Seduction implies opening yourself up, even if only for the purposes of deception; being unable to give by spending money usually means being unable to give in general. Stamp ungenerosity out. It is an impediment to power and a gross sin in seduction.","Imagine a person who never develops these acting skills, whose face instantly grimaces when he dislikes what you say or cannot suppress a yawn when you fail to entertain him, who always speaks his mind, who completely goes his own way in his ideas and style, who acts the same whether he\u2019s talking to his boss or to a child, and you have imagined a person who would be shunned, ridiculed, and despised.","Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.","Napole\xf3n: cubrir tu mano de hierro con un guante de terciopelo.","At the core of this pattern is a continual back-and-forth rhythm that comes from emerging generations reacting against the imbalances and mistakes of the previous generation. If we go back four generations in our own time we can clearly see this. We start with the silent generation. As children experiencing the Great Depression and as adults coming of age during World War II and the postwar period, they became rather cautious and conservative, valuing stability, material comforts, and fitting tightly into the group. The next generation, the baby boomers, found the conformity of their parents rather stifling. Emerging in the 1960s, and not haunted by the harsh financial realities of their parents, this generation valued personal expression, having adventures, and being idealistic. This was followed by Generation X, which was marked by the chaos of the 1960s and the ensuing social and political scandals. Coming of age in the 1980s and 1990s, it was pragmatic and confrontational, valuing individualism and self-reliance. This generation reacted against the hypocrisies and impracticalities in their parents\u2019 idealism. This was followed by the millennial generation. Traumatized by terrorism and a financial crisis, they reacted against the individualism of the last generation, craving security and teamwork, with a noted dislike of conflict and confrontation.","To begin this process, you need to train yourself to pay less attention to the words that people say and greater attention to their tone of voice, the look in their eye, their body language\u2014all signals that might reveal a nervousness or excitement that is not expressed verbally. If you can get people to become emotional, they will reveal a lot more.","People tend to wear the mask that shows them off in the best possible light\u2014humble, confident, diligent. They say the right things, smile, and seem interested in our ideas. They learn to conceal their insecurities and envy. If we take this appearance for reality, we never really know their true feelings, and on occasion we are blindsided by their sudden resistance, hostility, and manipulative actions. Fortunately, the mask has cracks in it. People continually leak out their true feelings and unconscious desires in the nonverbal cues they cannot completely control\u2014facial expressions, vocal inflections, tension in the body, and nervous gestures. You must master this language by transforming yourself into a superior reader of men and women. Armed with this knowledge, you can take the proper defensive measures. On the other hand, since appearances are what people judge you by, you must learn how to present the best front and play your role to maximum effect.","Mira hasta el final, sea lo que fuere lo que est\xe9s contemplando. A menudo Dios otorga al hombre un breve instante de felicidad, para luego arruinarlo por completo.","Absence and presence have very primal effects upon us. Too much presence suffocates; a degree of absence spurs our interest. We are marked by the continual desire to possess what we do not have\u2014 the object projected by our fantasies. Learn to create some mystery around you, to use strategic absence to make people desire your return, to want to possess you. Dangle in front of others what they are missing most in life, what they are forbidden to have, and they will go crazy with desire. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Overcome this weakness in yourself by embracing your circumstances, your fate.","But this means that he will be disliked on account of his superiority; and if a man is to be liked, he must really be inferior in point of intellect. ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER, 1788\u20131860","Often it is the quiet ones, those who give out less at first glance, who hide greater depths, and who secretly wield greater power.","You connect to the trends of the moment and to the current flow of life. But you derive even greater pleasure from reaching your long-term goals and overcoming adversity. This expanded relationship to time will have a definite effect on you. It will make you calmer, more realistic, more in tune with the things that matter. It will also make you a superior strategist in life, able to resist people\u2019s inevitable overreactions to what is happening in the present and to see further into the future, a potential power that we humans have only begun to tap into.","Men of this type often had strong mother figures in their childhood.

Men who engage in this kind of projection need to develop the less conventional sides of their character. They need to move outside their comfort zone and try new experiences on their own. They require more challenges, and even a bit of danger that will help loosen them up. Perhaps they need to take more risks at work. They also need to develop the more physical and sensual side of their character. Not having to get what they crave by looking for the Fallen Woman type, they can actually begin to satisfy their urges with any type of woman, not passively waiting for her to lead them astray but actively initiating the guilty pleasures.","There are no principles; there are only events. There is no good and bad, there are only","Quien pregunta a un adivino cu\xe1l ser\xe1 su futuro, sin querer ignora una intuici\xf3n interior de las cosas por venir, que es mil veces m\xe1s exacta que cualquier cosa que el adivino pueda decirle.

You are continually observing them and bringing your readings of them up to date.","When T. E. Lawrence was fighting the Turks in the deserts of the Middle East during World War I, he had an epiphany: It seemed to him that conventional warfare had lost its value. The old-fashioned soldier was lost in the enormous armies of the time, in which he was ordered about like a lifeless pawn. Lawrence wanted to turn this around.

That should be the supreme value that guides people\u2019s actions. But fools carry with them a different scale of values. They place more importance on short-term matters\u2014grabbing immediate money, getting attention from the public or media, and looking good. They are ruled by their ego and insecurities. They tend to enjoy drama and political intrigue for their own sake. When they criticize, they always emphasize matters that are irrelevant to the overall picture or argument. They are more interested in their career and position than in the truth. You can distinguish them by how little they get done, or by how hard they make it for others to get results. They lack a certain common sense, getting worked up about things that are not really important while ignoring problems that will spell doom in the long term.

Hence a prince who wants to keep his authority must learn how not to be good, and use that knowledge, or refrain from using it, as necessity requires.

Be intrepid in this process.","Con demasiada frecuencia creemos que el poder cambia a la gente, cuando en realidad la muestra tal como es.","Related to this is what is known as Othello\u2019s error. In the play Othello by Shakespeare, the main character, Othello, assumes that his wife, Desdemona, is guilty of adultery based on her nervous response when questioned about some evidence. In truth Desdemona is innocent, but the aggressive, paranoid nature of Othello and his intimidating questions make her nervous, which he interprets as a sign of guilt. What happens in such cases is that we pick up certain emotional cues from the other person\u2014nervousness, for instance\u2014and we assume they come from a certain source. We rush to the first explanation that fits what we want to see. But the nervousness could have several explanations, could be a temporary reaction to our questioning or the overall circumstances. The error is not in the observing but in the decoding.","false path in life is generally something we are attracted to for the wrong reasons\u2014money, fame, attention, and so on. If it is attention we need, we often experience a kind of emptiness inside that we are hoping to fill with the false love of public approval. Because the field we choose does not correspond with our deepest inclinations, we rarely find the fulfillment that we crave.","To be a brilliant exploiter of talent your position must be unshakable, or you will be accused of deception.","Do not underestimate the power of Tafari. He creeps like a mouse but he has jaws like a loin. - Balcha of Sidamo\'s last words before entering the monastery.","Judge people by their actions.","You cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across, but you must be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing to fear from outshining him. Do not be merciful--your master had no such scruples in his own cold-blodded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall: outdo, outcharm, outsmart him at key moments. If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course. Do not risk outshining a feeble superior--it might appear cruel or spiteful. But if your master is firm in his position, yet you know yourself to be the more capable, bide your time and be patient. IT is the natural course of things that power eventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall someday, and if you play it right, you will outlive and someday outshine him.","You often do not know your friends as well as you imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend each other. They laugh extra hard at each other\'s jokes. Since honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels. Friends will say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste of clothes-- maybe they mean it, often they do not.","Weakness is no sin, and can even become a strength if you learn how to play it right.","The following are six fundamental ideals you should aim for in transforming yourself into a strategic warrior in daily life.","Those who seek to achieve things should show no mercy. Kautilya, Indian philosopher third century B.C.","In the evolution of fear, a decisive moment occurred in the nineteenth century when people in advertising and journalism discovered that if they framed their stories and appeals with fear, they could capture our attention.","The trick is simple: You simply blend in with those around you.

They will inevitably have a track record of firing people for strange reasons. They will not seem particularly happy with that excellent report you turned in. Always play it safe by deferring to bosses, making them look better, and earning their trust. Couch your brilliant ideas as their ideas. Let them get all the credit for your hard work. Your time to shine will come,","After all, you might argue, we are now so sophisticated and technologically advanced, so progressive and enlightened; we have moved well beyond our primitive roots; we are in the process of rewriting our nature. But the truth is in fact the opposite\u2014we have never been more in the thrall of human nature and its destructive potential than now. And by ignoring this fact, we are playing with fire.","This process of hardwiring cannot occur if you are constantly distracted, moving from one task to another. In such a case, the neural pathways dedicated to this skill never get established; what you learn is too tenuous to remain rooted in the brain. It is better to dedicate two or three hours of intense focus to a skill than to spend eight hours of diffused concentration on it.

No moment is wasted if you pay attention and learn the lessons contained in every experience. By constantly applying yourself to the subject that suits your inclinations and attacking it from many different angles, you are simply enriching the ground for these seeds to take root.","It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors, to put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not despair at having to wear such a bland mask--it is often your unreadability that draws people to you and makes you appear a person of power.","Fear is not designed to make us feel that we are fragile creatures in an environment full of danger. Its function is to stimulate powerful physical responses, allowing an animal to retreat in time. After the event, it is supposed to go away.

NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, 1769-1821","Depend on your own arms.","From now on you need never await temporal attestation to your thought. You think the truth. You do not have the right to eliminate yourself. You do not belong to you. You belong to Universe. Your significance will remain forever obscure to you, but you may assume that you are fulfilling your role if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the highest advantage of others.","What is offered for free is dangerous--it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit.","What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after.","If people with natural gifts also possess a good work ethic and have some luck in life, envy will follow them wherever they go.","... patience ... the principal requirement in the art of timing.","Hace falta m\xe1s talento para amar que para mandar ej\xe9rcitos. NINON DE L\u2019ENCLOS","A veces puedes lograr m\xe1s no haciendo nada.","When you are faced with deficiencies instead of strengths and inclinations, this is the strategy you must assume: ignore your weaknesses and resist the temptation to be more like others. Instead, like Temple Grandin, direct yourself toward the small things you are good at.","Both deliberately and unconsciously, we often develop, a social exterior designed specifically to disguise our weaknesses and lacks. For instance, you may think you are dealing with someone who is tough and cynical, without realizing that deep inside they have a soft sentimental core.","Familiarity in this existence makes all things tame, for what may seem Terrible or bizarre, when once our eyes have had time to acclimatize,","Keep in mind that there are generally more extroverts than introverts in the world.","When you show yourself in the world and display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment, envy, and other manifestations of insecurity.","Our personalities are often molded by how we are treated: if a parent or spouse is defensive or argumentative in dealing with us, we tend to respond the same way. Never mistake people\u2019s exterior characteristics for reality, for the character they show on the surface may be merely a reflection of the people with whom they have been most in contact, or a front disguising its own opposite. A gruff exterior may hide a person dying for warmth; a repressed, sober-looking type may actually be struggling to conceal uncontrollable emotions. That is the key to charm\u2014feeding what has been repressed or denied.","Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote, \u201cWe do claim that direct annihilation of the enemy\u2019s forces must always be the dominant consideration.... Once a major victory is achieved there must be no talk of rest, of breathing space... but only of the pursuit, going for the enemy again, seizing his capital, attacking his reserves and anything else that might give his country aid and comfort.","it is hard to be angry or defensive with someone who seems to agree with your opinions and tastes. Charmers may appear to be weaker than their targets but in the end they are the more powerful side because they have stolen the ability to resist.","Never try to seduce someone who is of your own type. You will be like two puzzles missing the same parts.","Powerful people judge everything by what it costs, not just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind.","Only the weak rest on their laurels and dote on past triumphs; in the game of power there is never time to rest.","Absence diminishes minor passions and inflames great ones, as the wind douses a candle and fans a fire. La Rochefoucauld, 1613-1680","Monopolies often turn inward and destroy themselves from the internal pressure.","Desire often creates paradoxical effects. The more you want something, the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The more interest you show, the more you repel the object of your desire. This is because your interest is too strong \u2014 it makes people awkward, even fearful. Uncontrollable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic.","Power depends on the ability to fill a void ...","El problema es que, por lo general, estamos demasiado absortos en nosotros mismos: pensamos m\xe1s en lo que queremos de otras personas que en lo que ellas podr\xedan querer de nosotros.","Everything in nature has a structure, a way that the parts relate to one another, which is generally fluid and not so easy to conceptualize.","We are all in search of feeling more connected to reality\u2026We indulge in drugs or alcohol, or engage in dangerous sports or risky behavior, just to wake ourselves up from the sleep of our daily existence and feel a heightened sense of connection to reality. In the end, however, the most satisfying and powerful way to feel this connection is through creative activity. Engaged in the creative process we feel more alive than ever, because we are making something and not merely consuming, masters of the small reality we create.","Un verso [de un poema] quiz\xe1 pueda llevarnos horas; pero si no parece una inspiraci\xf3n del momento, todo el trabajo habr\xe1 sido en vano. LA MALDICI\xd3N DE AD\xc1N, WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS, 1865-1939","One master said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just look for the best move. He looks for the move that will disturb the man he is playing.","Elevate yourself above the battlefield.","... circumstances never repeat themselves exactly.","The essence of deception is distraction.","ignore your weaknesses and resist the temptation to be more like others.","If you see yourself as an object, then others will too. An ethereal, dreamlike air will heighten the effect.","In fact, whenever you must learn a new skill or alter your career path later in life, you reconnect with that youthful, adventurous part of yourself.","You are a blank screen. Float through life noncommittally and people will want to seize you and consume you. Of all the parts of your body that draw this fetishistic attention, the strongest is the face; so learn to tune your face like an instrument, making it radiate a fascinating vagueness for effect.","Mao\'s father had valued manual work over intellect; Mao had scoffed at this as a young man, but as he grew older he unconsciously returned to his father\'s views and echoed such outdated ideas by forcing a whole generation of Chinese intellectuals into manual labor, a nightmarish mistake that cost his regime dearly. Remember: You are your own father. Do not let yourself spend years creating yourself only to let your guard down and allow the ghost of the past \u2014 father, habit, history \u2014 to sneak back in.","In other words, concentrated practice over time cannot fail but produce results.","The Great German general Erwin Rommel once made a distinction between a gamble and a risk. Both cases involve an action with only a chance of success, a chance that is heightened by acting with boldness. The difference is that with a risk, if you lose, you can recover: your reputation will suffer no long-term damage, your resources will not be depleted, and you can return to your original position with acceptable losses. With a gamble, on the other hand, defeat can lead to a slew of problems that are likely to spiral out of control. With a gamble there tend to be too many variables to complicate the picture down the road if things go on. The problem goes further: if you encounter difficulties in a gamble, it becomes harder to pull out\u2014you realize that the stakes are too high; you cannot afford to lose. So you try harder to rescue the situation, often making it worse and sinking deeper in to the hole that you cannot get out of. People are drawn into gambles by their emotions: they see only glittering prospects if they win and ignore the ominous consequences if the lose. Taking risks is essential; gambling is foolhardy. It can be years before you recover from a gamble, if you recover at all.","Yet another way of avoiding the game would be perfect honesty and straightforwardness, since one of the main techniques of those who seek power is deceit and secrecy. But being perfectly honest will inevitably hurt and insult a great many people, some of whom will choose to injure you in return. No one will see your honest statement as completely objective and free of some personal motivation. And they will be right: In truth, the use of honesty is indeed a power strategy, intended to convince people of one\u2019s noble, good-hearted, selfless character. It is a form of persuasion, even a subtle form of coercion.","Spiritualize your warfare.","Remember, your own image and presence are materials you can control.","It is a deadly but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting your gifts and talents, you are winning the master\u2019s affection.","What withdraws, what becomes scarce, suddenly seems to deserve our respect and honor.","Hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself, and over time.","REVERSAL There can never be any value in fighting uneconomically, but it is always a wise course to make your opponent waste as much of his resources as possible. This can be done through hit-and-run tactics, forcing him to expend energy chasing after you. Lure him into thinking that one big offensive will ruin you; then bog that offensive down in a protracted war in which he loses valuable time and resources. A frustrated opponent exhausting energy on punches he cannot land will soon make mistakes and open himself up to a vicious counterattack.","Remember, your own image and presence are materials you can control. The sense that you are engaged in this kind of play will make people see you as superior and worthy of imitation.","(The origin of the word \u201cseduction is the Latin for \u201cto lead astray.\u201d)\u201d","Antes que nada, quisiera dar las gracias a Anna Biller por sus incontables contribuciones a este libro:","At a certain point, you can almost become a stranger to yourself.","The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.","So I went down to their office and I said, \u201cWell, I\'ll write a column for you. So the first year I didn\'t get paid anything, but I wrote a little column every month\u201d","Test for Envy","The past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that would be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself.... Making a display of doing things differently from your predecessor can make you seem childish and in fact out of control, unless your actions have a logic of their own.","En todas las esferas de la vida, nunca des la impresi\xf3n de que buscas algo; esto producir\xe1 una resistencia que nunca someter\xe1s.","The root of the Latin word for envy, invidia, means \u201cto look through, to probe with the eyes like a dagger.","Por esto, cuando he conseguido una victoria, no vuelvo a emplear la misma t\xe1ctica otra vez, sino que, respondiendo a las circunstancias, var\xedo mis m\xe9todos hasta el infinito. \u2014Sun-tzu (siglo IV a.C.).","People rarely believe that their problems arise from their own misdeeds and stupidity. Someone or something out there is to blame-the other, the world, the gods- and so salvation comes from the outside as well.","The hyperfeminine woman will often be concealing a great deal of repressed anger and resentment at the role she has been forced to play. Her seductive, girlish behavior with men is actually a ploy for power, to tease, entrap, and hurt the target. Her masculine side will leak out in passive-aggressive behavior, attempts to dominate people in relationships in underhanded ways. Underneath the sweet, deferential fa\xe7ade, she can be quite willful and highly judgmental of others. Her willfulness, always under the surface, will come out in rather irrational stubbornness in petty matters.","The eyes are indeed a telling indicator, but the envious microexpression affects the entire face.","Mack hab\xeda sido capturado una vez y forzado a pasar tres a\xf1os en Francia, donde hab\xeda estudiado el estilo b\xe9lico de Napole\xf3n.","Un paso cr\xedtico en la creaci\xf3n de una eficiente cadena de mando es reunir un equipo calificado que comparta tus metas y valores. Este equipo te dar\xe1 muchas ventajas: personas entusiastas y motivadas que pueden pensar por s\xed mismas; una imagen como delegador@, como l\xedder just@ y democr\xe1tic@, y un ahorro de tu valiosa energ\xeda, que puedes reorientar hacia el panorama general.","The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer devised a quick way to test for envy. Tell suspected enviers some good news about yourself\u2014a promotion, a new and exciting love interest, a book contract. You will notice a very quick expression of disappointment","These types, for example, will often display their weakness and lack of power as a kind of moral virtue. But true powerlessness, without any motive of self-interest, would not publicize its weakness to gain sympathy or respect. Making a show of one\u2019s weakness is actually a very effective strategy, subtle and deceptive, in the game of power","People who are envious cannot help feeling some glee when they hear of the bad luck of those they envy.","The reason is simple\u2014humans are extremely susceptible to the moods, emotions, and even the ways of thinking of those with whom they spend their time.","These steps are: Deep Observation (The Passive Mode), Skills Acquisition (The Practice Mode), and Experimentation (The Active Mode).","But if, to avoid the taint of power, you attempt to treat everyone equally and fairly, you will confront the problem that some people do certain things better than others. Treating everyone equally means ignoring their differences, elevating the less skillful and suppressing those who excel. Again, many of those who behave this way are actually deploying another power strategy, redistributing people\u2019s rewards in a way that they determine.","Daily Law: If you see such looks in the first few encounters with someone, and they happen more than once, be on the lookout for a dangerous envier entering your life.","There are many paths to mastery, and if you are persistent you will certainly find one that suits you. But a key component in the process is determining your mental and psychological strengths and working with them.","The world is full of self-absorbed people. In their presence, we know that everything in our relationship with them is directed toward themselves\u2014their insecurities, their neediness, their hunger for attention.","The Laws of Human Nature, 10: Beware the Fragile Ego\u2014The Law of Envy","The mind must not wander from goal to goal, or be distracted by success from its sense of purpose and proportion. What is concentrated, coherent, and connected to its past has power. What is dissipated, divided, and distended rots and falls to the ground. The bigger it bloats, the harder it falls.","What money should buy is not lifeless objects but power over people.","The great danger is that we give in to feelings of boredom, impatience, fear, and confusion. We stop observing and learning. The process comes to a halt.","No pienses en por qu\xe9 preguntas, simplemente no dejes de preguntar. No te preocupes por lo que no puedes responder, y no intentes explicar lo que no sabes. La curiosidad es su propia raz\xf3n. \xbfAcaso no te sobrecoge contemplar los misterios de la eternidad, de la vida, de la maravillosa estructura detr\xe1s de la realidad? Y \xe9ste es el milagro de la mente humana: usar sus construcciones, conceptos y f\xf3rmulas como instrumentos para explicar lo que el hombre ve, siente y toca. Intenta comprender un poco m\xe1s cada d\xeda. Ten una curiosidad sagrada. \u2013ALBERT EINSTEIN Mientras","Alexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his tutor and mentor, and throughout his short life he remained devoted to philosophy and his master\u2019s teachings. He once complained to Aristotle that during his long campaigns he had no one with whom he could discuss philosophical matters. Aristotle responded by suggesting that he take Callisthenes, a former pupil of Aristotle\u2019s and a promising philosopher in his own right, along on the next campaign. Aristotle had schooled Callisthenes in the skills of being a courtier, but the young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure philosophy, in unadorned words, in speaking the naked truth. If Alexander loved learning so much, Callisthenes thought, he could not object to one who spoke his mind. During one of Alexander\u2019s major campaigns, Callisthenes spoke his mind one too many times and Alexander had him put to death.","For each weakness there is a corresponding strength.","Your enemies, those you stand sharply against, will help you to forge a support base that will not desert you. Do not crowd into the center, where everyone else is; there is no room to fight in a crowd. Polarize people, drive some of them away, and create a space for battle.","It seems abusive or damaging to people\u2019s self-esteem to offer them stern, realistic criticism, to set them tasks that will make them aware of how far they have to go. In fact, this indulgence and fear of hurting people\u2019s feelings is far more abusive in the long run. It makes it hard for people to gauge where they are or to develop self-discipline. It makes them unsuited for the rigors of the journey to mastery. It weakens people\u2019s will.","inducted into the International Boxing Hall of","For Chinese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor advice was an important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had died trying to warn or counsel their master. To be made safely, their criticisms had to be indirect\u2014yet if they were too indirect they would not be heeded. The chronicles were their solution: Identify no one person as the source of criticism, make the advice as impersonal as possible, but let the emperor know the gravity of the situation.","DINERO Yusuf Ibn Jafar el-Amudi sol\xeda tomar sumas de dinero, a veces muy grandes, de quienes iban a estudiar con \xe9l.

If you absent yourself too early, you may be forgotten. But once your lover\u2019s emotions are engaged, and the feeling of love has crystallized, absence inflames and excites. Giving no reason for your absence excites even more: The other person assumes he or she is at fault.
