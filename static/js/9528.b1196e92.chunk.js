They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways.","In the small matters trust the mind, in the large ones the heart.","One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.","We choose not randomly each other. We meet only those who already exists in our subconscious.","Human beings are funny. They long to be with the person they love but refuse to admit openly. Some are afraid to show even the slightest sign of affection because of fear. Fear that their feelings may not be recognized, or even worst, returned. But one thing about human beings puzzles me the most is their conscious effort to be connected with the object of their affection even if it kills them slowly within.","Most people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves responsibility, and most people are frightened of responsibility.","Out of your vulnerabilities will come your strength.","We are what we are because we have been what we have been.","All family life is organized around the most damaged person in it.","The great question that has never been answered, and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is \'What does a woman want?\'","Love is a state of temporary psychosis.","Words have a magical power. They can bring either the greatest happiness or deepest despair; they can transfer knowledge from teacher to student; words enable the orator to sway his audience and dictate its decisions. Words are capable of arousing the strongest emotions and prompting all men\'s actions.","I have found little \'good\' about human beings. In my experience, most of them are trash.","The aim of psychoanalysis is to relieve people of their neurotic unhappiness so that they can be normally unhappy.","History is just new people making old mistakes.","The only shame in masturbation is the shame of not doing it well.","The only person with whom you have to compare ourselves, is that you in the past. And the only per-son better you should be, this is who you are now.","That which we can\'t remember, we will repeat.","Two hallmarks of a healthy life are the abilities to love and to work. Each requires imagination.","The mind is like an iceberg, it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water.","I prefer the company of animals more than the company of humans. Certainly, a wild animal is cruel. But to be merciless is the privilege of civilized humans.","Dreams are the royal road to the unconscious.","Time spent with cats is never wasted.","I became aware of my destiny: to belong to the critical minority as opposed to the unquestioning majority.","Without love we fall ill.","Not to know the past is to be in bondage to it, while to remember, to know, is to be set free.","Knowledge is the intellectual manipulation of carefully verified observations.","When inspiration does not come to me, I go halfway to meet it.","From error to error one discovers the entire truth.","Neurosis is the inability to tolerate ambiguity.","Maturity is the ability to postpone gratification.","If you want your wife to listen to you, then talk to another woman; she will be all ears.","To be completely honest with oneself is the very best effort a human being can make.","Look into the depths of your own soul and learn first to know yourself, then you will understand why this illness was bound to come upon you and perhaps you will thenceforth avoid falling ill.","Where does a thought go when it\'s forgotten?","Crystals reveal their hidden structures only when broken.","Life, as we find it, is too hard for us; it brings us too many pains, disappointments and impossible tasks. In order to bear it we cannot dispense with palliative measures... There are perhaps three such measures: powerful deflections, which cause us to make light of our misery; substitutive satisfactions, which diminish it; and intoxicating substances, which make us insensible to it.","There is little that gives children greater pleasure than when a grown-up lets himself down to their level, renounces his oppressive superiority and plays with them as an equal.","The unconscious of one human being can react upon that of another without passing through the conscious.","The only unnatural sexual behavior is none at all.","America is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen, but, I am afraid, it is not going to be a success.","Psychiatry is the art of teaching people how to stand on their own feet while reclining on couches.","When one does not have what one wants, one must want what one has.","Religion is a system of wishful illusions together with a disavowal of reality, such as we find nowhere else but in a state of blissful hallucinatory confusion. Religion\'s eleventh commandment is \\"Thou shalt not question.\\"","Where they love they do not desire and where they desire they do not love.","Poets are masters of us ordinary men, in knowledge of the mind, because they drink at streams which we have not yet made accessible to science.","When a man is freed of religion, he has a better chance to live a normal and wholesome life.","Were we fully to understand the reasons for other people\'s behavior, it would all make sense.","A man who has been the indisputable favorite of his mother keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror.","A woman should soften but not weaken a man.","It is not attention that the child is seeking, but love.","Words have a magical power. They can either bring the greatest happiness or the deepest despair.","Civilization began the first time an angry person cast a word instead of a rock.","If it\'s not one thing, it\'s your mother.","The paranoid is never entirely mistaken.","The Irish are the one race for which psychoanalysis is of no use whatsoever... because they already live in a dream world.","How bold one gets when one is sure of being loved.","Whoever loves becomes humble. Those who love have, so to speak, pawned a part of their narcissism.","One must learn to give up momentary, uncertain and destructive pleasure for delayed, restrained, but dependable pleasure.","It is impossible to escape the impression that people commonly use false standards of measurement -- that they seek power, success and wealth for themselves and admire them in others, and that they underestimate what is of true value in life.","Dogs love their friends and bite their enemies, quite unlike people, who are incapable of pure love and always have to mix love and hate.","When someone abuses me I can defend myself, but against praise I am defenceless.","Our possibilities of happiness are already restricted by our constitution. Unhappiness is much less difficult to experience. We are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our own body, which is doomed to decay and dissolution and which cannot even do without pain and anxiety as warning signals; from the external world, which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless forces of destruction; and finally from our relations to other men. The suffering which comes from this last source is perhaps more painful to us than any other.","Conservatism, however, is too often a welcome excuse for lazy minds, loath to adapt themselves to fast changing conditions.","Intolerance of groups is often, strangely enough, exhibited more strongly against small differences than against fundamental ones.","Being entirely honest with oneself is a good exercise.","Humanity is in the highest degree irrational, so that there is no prospect of influencing it by reasonable arguments.  Against prejudice one can do nothing.","The news that reaches your consciousness is incomplete and often not to be relied on.... Turn your eyes inward, look into your own depths, learn first to know yourself!","If you can\'t do it, give up!","All giving is asking, and all asking is an asking for love.","Religious ideas have sprung from the same need as all the other achievements of culture: from the necessity for defending itself against the crushing supremacy of nature.","Flowers are restful to look at. They have neither emotions nor conflicts.","None believes in his own death. In the unconscious everyone is convinced of his own immortality.","A strong egoism is a protection.","In the depths of my heart I can\u2019t help being convinced that my dear fellow-men, with a few exceptions, are worthless.","The moment a man questions the meaning and value of life, he is sick, since objectively neither has any existence; by asking this question one is merely admitting to a store of unsatisfied libido to which something else must have happened, a kind of fermentation leading to sadness and depression.","Perception is less of a recording system and more of a protection system against external stimuli.","Psychoanalysis is in essence a cure through love.","America is a mistake, a giant mistake.","My boy! Smoking is one of the greatest and cheapest enjoyments in life, and if you decide in advance not to smoke, i can only feel sorry for you.","The ego represents what we call reason and sanity, in contrast to the id which contains the passions.","Love and work, work and love...that\'s all there is.","I\'ve been a fortunate man in life, nothing has come easily.","The goal of all life is death","I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father\'s protection.","In the theory of psycho-analysis we have no hesitation in assuming that the course taken by mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle. We believe, that is to say, that the course of those events is invariably set in motion by an unpleasurable tension, and that it takes a direction such that its final outcome coincides with a lowering of that tension that is, with an avoidance of unpleasure or a production of pleasure.","When a love-relationship is at its height there is no room left for any interest in the environment; a pair of lovers are sufficient to themselves","The madman is a dreamer awake","Men are more moral than they think and far more immoral than they can imagine.","Children are completely egoistic; they feel their needs intensely and strive ruthlessly to satisfy them.","Perhaps the gods are kind to us, by making life more disagreeable as we grow older.  In the end death seems less intolerable than the manifold burdens we carry","Dreams are often most profound when they seem the most crazy.","The sexual life of adult women is a \\"dark continent\\" for psychology.","We are never so defensless against suffering as when we love.","Dreams are constructed from the residue of yesterday.","I had the greatest respect for the authorities of my day--until I studied things for myself, and came to my own conclusions.","Love in the form of longing and deprivation lowers the self regard.","A father\'s death is the most important event, the more heartbreaking and poignant loss in a man\'s life.","Words and magic were in the beginning one and the same thing, and even today words retain much of their magical power.","The intention that man should be happy is not in the plan of Creation.","Indeed, the great Leonardo (da Vinci) remained like a child for the whole of his life in more than one way. It is said that all great men are bound to retain some infantile part. Even as an adult he continued to play, and this was another reason why he often appeared uncanny and incomprehensible to his contemporaries.","Men are not gentle, friendly creatures wishing for love, who simply defend themselves if they are attacked, but ... a powerful measure of desire for aggression had to be reckoned as part of their instinctual endowment.","My love is something valuable to me which I ought not to throw away without reflection.","Men are strong so long as they represent a strong idea they become powerless when they oppose it.","The creative writer does the same as the child at play; he creates a world of fantasy which he takes very seriously.","Illusions commend themselves to us because they save us pain and allow us to enjoy pleasure instead.","We are never so defenseless against suffering as when we love, never so forlornly unhappy as when we have lost our love object or its love.","Anxiety in children is originally nothing other than an expression of the fact they are feeling the loss of the person they love.","The behavior of a human being in sexual matters is often a prototype for the whole of his other modes of reaction in life.","When making a decision of minor importance, I have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life, we should be governed, I think, by the deep inner needs of our nature.","Beauty has no obvious use; nor is there any clear cultural necessity for it. Yet civilization could not do without it.","The psychoanalysis of individual human beings, however, teaches us with quite special insistence that the god of each of them is formed in the likeness of his father, that his personal relation to God depends on his relation to his father in the flesh and oscillates and changes along with that relation, and that at bottom God is nothing other than an exalted father.","If there are quarrels between the parents or if their marriage is unhappy, the ground will be prepared in their children for the severest predisposition to a disturbance of sexual development or to neurotic illness.","There is a psychological technique which makes it possible to interpret dreams, and ... if that procedure is employed, every dream reveals itself as a psychical structure which has a meaning and which can be inserted at an assignable point in the mental activities of waking life.","Demons do not exist any more than gods do, being only the products of the psychic activity of man.","A layman will no doubt find it hard to understand how pathological disorders of the body and mind can be eliminated by \'mere\' words. He will feel that he is being asked to believe in magic. And he will not be so very wrong, for the words which we use in our everyday speech are nothing other than watered-down magic. But we shall have to follow a roundabout path in order to explain how science sets about restoring to words a part at least of their former magical power.","The ego refuses to be distressed by the provocations of reality, to let itself be compelled to suffer. It insists that it cannot be affected by the traumas of the external world; it shows, in fact, that such traumas are no more than occasions for it to gain pleasure.","Religion belonged to the infancy of humanity. Now that humanity had come of age, it should be left behind.","We find a place for what we lose. Although we know that after such a loss the acute stage of mourning will subside, we also know that we shall remain inconsolable and will never find a substitute. No matter what may fill the gap, even if it be filled completely, it nevertheless remains something else.","If you want to endure life, prepare yourself for death.","The meager satisfaction that man can extract from reality leaves him starving.","So in every individual the two trends, one towards personal happiness and the other unity with the rest of humanity, must contend with each other.","A civilization which leaves so large a number of its participants unsatisfied and drives them into revolt neither has nor deserves the prospect of a lasting existence.","A poor girl may have an illusion that a prince will come and fetch her home. It is possible, some such cases have occurred. That the Messiah will come and found a golden age is much less probable.","Toward the person who has died we adopt a special attitude: something like admiration for someone who has accomplished a very difficult task.","I no longer count as one of my merits that I always tell the truth as much as possible; it has become my metier.","Humor is a means of obtaining pleasure in spite of the distressing effects that interface with it.","Every normal person, in fact, is only normal on the average. His ego approximates to that of the psychotic in some part or other and to a greater or lesser extent.","There is no likelihood of our being able to suppress humanity\'s aggressive tendencies...  Complete suppression of man\'s aggressive tendencies is not an issue; what we may try is to direct it into a channel other than that of warfare.","Instinct of love toward an object demands a mastery to obtain it, and if a person feels they can\'t control the object or feel threatened by it, they act negatively toward it.","A man\'s heterosexuality will not put up with any homosexuality, and vice versa.","Cruelty and intolerance to those who do not belong to it are natural to every religion.","Religion restricts the play of choice and adaptation, since it imposes equally on everyone its own path to the acquisition of happiness and protection from suffering. Its technique consists in depressing the value of life and distorting the picture of the real world in a delusional manner - which presupposes an intimidation of the intelligence. At this price, by forcibly fixing them in a state of psychical infantilism and by drawing them into a mass-delusion, religion succeeds in sparing many people an individual neurosis. But hardly anything more.","The world is no nursery.","What good to us is a long life if it is difficult and barren of joys, and if it is so full of misery that we can only welcome death as a deliverer?","Where id was, there ego shall be.","The first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization.","Everywhere I go I find that a poet has been there before me.","You wanted to kill your father in order to be your father yourself. Now you are your father, but a dead father.","Not all men are worthy of love.","There is a powerful force within us, an un-illuminated part of the mind - separate from the conscious mind that is constantly at work molding our thought, feelings, and actions.","We must love or we grow ill.","I cannot face with comfort the idea of life without work; work and the free play of the imagination are for me the same thing, I take no pleasure in anything else.","One is very crazy when in love.","If youth knew; if age could.","I am actually not at all a man of science, not an observer, not an experimenter, not a thinker. I am by temperament nothing but a conquistador","Immorality, no less than morality, has at all times found support in religion.","Cigars served me for precisely fifty years as protection and a weapon in the combat of life... I owe to the cigar a great intensification of my capacity to work and a facilitation of my self-control.","Religion originates in the child\'s and young mankind\'s fears and need for help. It cannot be otherwise.","The ego is not master in its own house.","Talk therapy turns hysterical misery to mundane unhappiness.","In human beings pure masculinity or femininity is not to be found either in a psychological or biological sense.","Might we not say that every child at play behaves like a creative writer, in that he creates a world of his own, or, rather, rearranges the things of his world in a new way which pleases him?","Properly speaking, the unconscious is the real psychic; its inner nature is just as unknown to us as the reality of the external world, and it is just as imperfectly reported to us through the data of consciousness as is the external world through the indications of our sensory organs.","In mourning it is the world which has become poor and empty; in melancholia it is the ego itself.","The doctor should be opaque to his patients and, like a mirror, should show them nothing but what is shown to him.","What we call happiness in the strictest sense comes from the (preferably sudden) satisfaction of needs which have been dammed up to a high degree.","What a distressing contrast there is between the radiant intelligence of the child and the feeble mentality of the average adult.","We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by the feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the two sexes as completely equal in position and worth.","A man should not strive to eliminate his complexes but to get into accord with them: they are legitimately what directs his conduct in the world.","The poets and philosophers before me discovered the unconscious; what I discovered was the scientific method by which the unconscious can be studied.","The true believer is in a high degree protected against the danger of certain neurotic afflictions; by accepting the universal neurosis he is spared the task of forming a personal neurosis.","Sexuality is the key to the problem of the psychoneuroses and of the neuroses in general. No one who disdains the key will ever be able to unlock the door.","It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built upon a renunciation of instinct.","Against the suffering which may come upon one from human relationships the readiest safeguard is voluntary isolation, keeping oneself aloof from other people. The happiness which can be achieved along this path is, as we see, the happiness of quietness. Against the dreaded external world one can only defend oneself by some kind of turning away from it, if one intends to solve the task by oneself.","We are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast.","The whole thing [religion] is so patently infantile, so foreign to reality, that to anyone with a friendly attitude to humanity it is painful to think that the great majority of mortals will never be able to rise above this view of life.","In the long run, nothing can withstand reason and experience, and the contradiction religion offers to both is palpable.","No neurotic harbors thoughts of suicide which are not murderous impulses against others redirected upon himself.","The very emphasis of the commandment: Thou shalt not kill, makes it certain that we are descended from an endlessly long chain of generations of murderers, whose love of murder was in their blood as it is perhaps also in ours.","The impression forces itself upon one that men measure by false standards, that everyone seeks power, success, riches for himself, and admires others who attain them, while undervaluing the truly precious thing in life.","Whatever fosters the growth of civilization works at the same time against war.","Once again, only religion can answer the question of the purpose of life. One can hardly be wrong in concluding that the idea of life having a purpose stands and falls with the religious system.","The time comes when each of us has to give up as illusions the expectations which, in his youth, he pinned upon his fellow-men, and when he may learn how much difficulty and pain has been added to his life by their ill-will.","The price of civilization is instinctual renunciation.","Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.","Just as a cautious businessman avoids investing all his capital in one concern, so wisdom would probably admonish us also not to anticipate all our happiness from one quarter alone.","If a man has been his mother\'s undisputed darling he retains throughout life the triumphant feeling, the confidence in success, which not seldom brings actual success along with it.","You can always make a lot of people love one another so long as there are a smaller number outside the group for them to kick.","Creativity is an attempt to resolve a conflict generated by unexpressed biological impulses, such that unfulfilled desires are the driving force of the imagination, and they fuel our dreams and daydreams.","Philosophers stretch the meaning of words until they retain scarcely anything of their original sense. They give the name of \\"God\\" to some vague abstraction which they have created for themselves; having done so they can pose before all the world as deists, as believers of God, and they can even boast that they have recognized a higher, purer concept of God, notwithstanding that their God is not nothing more than an insubstantial shadow and no longer the mighty personality of religious doctrines.","The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.","A man like me cannot live without a hobby-horse, a consuming passion - in Schiller\'s words a tyrant. I have found my tyrant, and in his service I know no limits. My tyrant is psychology. It has always been my distant, beckoning goal and now since I have hit upon the neuroses, it has come so much the nearer.","In matters of sexuality we are at present, every one of us, ill or well, nothing but hypocrites.","The primitive stages can always be re-established; the primitive mind is, in the fullest meaning of the word, imperishable.","Just as no one can be forced into belief, so no one can be forced into unbelief.","The voice of the intellect is soft one, but it does not rest until it has gained a hearing. Ultimately, after endless rebuffs, it succeeds. This is one of the few points in which one may be optimistic about the future of mankind.","The idea of life having a purpose stands and falls with the religious system.","Writing was in its origin, the voice of an absent person.","Where questions of religion are concerned, people are guilty of every possible sort of dishonesty and intellectual misdemeanor.","The adoption of the required attitude of mind towards ideas that seem to emerge \\"of their own free will\\" and the abandonment of the critical function that is normally in operation against them seem to be hard of achievement for some people. The \\"involuntary thoughts\\" are liable to release a most violent resistance, which seeks to prevent their emergence. If we may trust that great poet and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, however, poetic creation must demand an exactly similar attitude.","One thing only do I know for certain and that is that man\'s judgments of value follow directly his wishes for happiness-that, accordingly, they are an attempt to support his illusions with arguments. [p.111]","Conscience is the internal perception of the rejection of a particular wish operating within us.","As regards intellectual work it remains a fact, indeed, that great decisions in the realm of thought and momentous discoveries and solutions of problems are only possible to an individual, working in solitude.","Let us consider the polarity of love and hate.... Now, clinical observation shows not only that love is with unexpected regularityaccompanied by hate (ambivalence), and not only that in human relationships hate is frequently a forerunner of love, but also that in many circumstances hate changes into love and love into hate.","Our knowledge of the historical worth of certain religious doctrines increases our respect for them, but does not invalidate our proposal that they should cease to be put forward as the reasons for the precepts of civilization. On the contrary! Those historical residues have helped us to view religious teachings, as it were, as neurotic relics, and we may now argue that the time has probably come, as it does in an analytic treatment, for replacing the effects of repression by the results of the rational operation of the intellect.","The fateful question for the human species seems to me to be whether and to what extent their cultural development will succeed in mastering the disturbance of their communal life by the human instinct of aggression and self-destruction ... One thing only do I know for certain and that is that man\'s judgements of value follow directly from his wihes for happiness-that, accordingly, they are an attempt to support his illusions with arguments.","Mans most disagreeable habits and idiosyncrasies, his deceit, his cowardice, his lack of reverence, are engendered by his incomplete adjustment to a complicated civilisation. It is the result of the conflict between our instincts and our culture.","These [religious ideas] are given out as teachings, are not precipitates of experience or end-results of thinking: they are illusions, fullfilments of the oldest, strongest and most urgent wishes of mankind.","It must be pointed out, however, that strictly speaking it is incorrect to talk of the dominance of the pleasure principle over the course of mental processes. If such a dominance existed, the immense majority of our mental processes would have to be accompanied by pleasure or to lead to pleasure, whereas universal experience completely contradicts any such conclusion.","Religious illusion must bow to scientific truth. It is in total error about the nature of the true world. Only science is not an illusion.","I had thought about cocaine in a kind of day-dream.","This is one race of people for whom psychoanalysis is of no use whatsoever.","Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.","It is always possible to bind together a considerable number of people in love, so long as there are other people left over to receive the manifestations of their aggressiveness.","We know that the great majority of people have a strong need for authority which it can admire, to which it can submit, and which dominates and sometimes even ill-treats it.","The individual does actually carry on a double existence: one designed to serve his own purposes and another as a link in a chain, in which he serves against, or at any rate without, any volition of his own.","Thinking in pictures is, therefore, only a very incomplete form of becoming conscious. In some way, too, it stands nearer to unconscious processes than does thinking in words, and it is unquestionably older than the latter both ontogenetically and phylogenetically.","When making a decision of minor importance, I have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons.","Religion is an attempt to get control over the sensory world, in which we are placed, by means of the wish-world which we have developed inside us as a result of biological and psychological necessites.","Desire presses ever forward unsubdued.","Religion is the process of unconscious wish fulfillment, where, for certain people, if the process did not take place it would put them in self-danger of coming to mental harm, being unable to cope with the idea of a godless, purposeless life.","In the important decisions of personal life, we should be governed by the deep inner needs of our nature.","It is a mistake to believe that science consists in nothing but conclusively proved propositions, and it is unjust to demand that it should. It is a demand made by those who feel a craving for authority in some form to replace the religious catechism by something else, even a scientific one.","Civilization is a process in the service of Eros, whose purpose is to combine single human individuals, and after that families, then races, peoples and nations, into one great unity, the unity of mankind. Why this has to happen, we do not know; the work of Eros is precisely this.","It is a predisposition of human nature to consider an unpleasant idea untrue, and then it is easy to find arguments against it.","Experience teaches that for most people there is a limit beyond which their constitution cannot comply with the demands of civilization. All who wish to reach a higher standard than their constitution will allow, fall victims to neurosis. It would have been better for them if they could have remained less \\"perfect\\".","A religion, even if it calls itself a religion of love, must be hard and unloving to those who do not belong to it.","The voice of reason is small, but very persistent.","[The child receives impressions like] a photographic exposure that can be developed after any interval of time and transformed into a picture.","The price we pay for our advance in civilization is a loss of happiness through the heightening of the sense of guilt.","Illusions commend themselves to us because they save us pain and allow us to enjoy pleasure instead. We must therefore accept it without complaint when they sometimes collide with a bit of reality against which they are dashed to pieces.","Just as a satisfaction of instinct spells happiness for us, so severe suffering is caused us if the external world lets us starve, if it refuses to sate our needs. One may therefore hope to be freed from a part of one\'s sufferings by influencing the instinctual impulses.","When we share - that is poetry in the prose of life.","The psychical, whatever its nature may be, is itself unconscious.","The state in which the ideas existed before being made conscious is called by us repression, and we assert that the force which instituted the repression and maintains it is perceived as resistance during the work of analysis.","Religion (is) a universal obsessional neurosis.","The gods retain their threefold task: they must exorcize the terrors of nature, they must reconcile men to the cruelty of Fate, particularly as it is shown in death, and they must compensate them for the sufferings and privations which a civilized life in common has imposed on them.","The virtuous man contents himself with dreaming that which the wicked man does in actual life.","No other technique for the conduct of life attaches the individual so firmly to reality as laying emphasis on work; for his work at least gives him a secure place in a portion of reality, in the human community. The possibility it offers of displacing a large amount of libidinal components, whether narcissistic, aggressive or even erotic, on to professional work and on to the human relations connected with it lends it a value by no means second to what it enjoys as something indispensable to the preservation and justification of existence in society.","A strong egoism is a protection against disease, but in the last resort we must begin to love in order that we may not fall ill, and must fall ill if, in consequence of frustration, we cannot love.","It is not so much that man is a herd animal, but that he is a horde animal led by a chief.","Much of our highly valued cultural heritage has been acquired at the cost of sexuality.","I take up the standpoint that the tendency to aggression is an innate, independent, instinctual disposition in man, and I come back now to the statement that it constitutes the most powerful obstacle to culture.","A hero is a man who stands up manfully against his father and in the end victoriously overcomes him.","We may insist as often as we like that man\'s intellect is powerless in comparison to his instinctual life, and we may be right in this. Nevertheless, there is something peculiar about this weakness. The voice of the intellect is a soft one, but it will not rest until it has gained a hearing. Finally, after a countless succession of rebuffs, it succeeds.","The most complicated achievements of thought are possible without the assistance of consciousness.","The wish to be able to fly is to be understood as nothing else than a longing to be capable of sexual performance.","Life as we find it is too hard for us; it entails too much pain, too many disappointments, impossible tasks. We cannot do without palliative remedies.","What is characteristic of illusions is that they are derived from human wishes.","I have found little that is \'good\' about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all. That is something that you cannot say aloud, or perhaps even think.","The view is often defended that sciences should be built up on clear and sharply defined basal concepts. In actual fact no science, not even the most exact, begins with such definitions. The true beginning of scientific activity consists rather in describing phenomena and then in proceeding to group, classify and correlate them.","One must not be mean with the affections; what is spent of the fund is renewed in the spending itself.","A belligerent state permits itself every such misdeed, every such act of violence, as would disgrace the individual.","It might be said of psychoanalysis that if you give it your little finger it will soon have your whole hand.","Opposition is not necessarily enmity.","Civilized society is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primary hostility of men towards one another.","What decides the purpose of life is simply the programme of the pleasure principle. This principle dominates the operation of the mental apparatus from the start. There can be no doubt about its efficacy, and yet its programme is at loggerheads with the whole world, with the macrocosm as much as with the microcosm.","Dreams are the guardians of sleep and not its disturbers.","He that has eyes to see and ears to hear may convince himself that no mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.","The more the fruits of knowledge become accessible to men, the more widespread is the decline of religious belief.","Obviously one must hold oneself responsible for the evil impulses of one\'s dreams. In what other way can one deal with them? Unless the content of the dream rightly understood is inspired by alien spirits, it is part of my own being.","All that matters is love and work.","It would be one of the greatest triumphs of humanity, one of the most tangible liberations from the constraints of nature to which mankind is subject, if we could succeed in raising the responsible act of procreating children to the level of a deliberate and intentional activity and in freeing it from its entanglement with the necessary satisfaction of a natural need.","Incidentally, why was it that none of all the pious ever discovered psycho-analysis? Why did it have to wait for a completely godless Jew?","The inclination to aggression constitutes the greatest impediment to civilization.","When it happens that a person has to give up a sexual object, there quite often ensues an alteration of his ego which can only be described as a setting up of the object inside the ego, as it occurs in melancholia; the exact nature of this substitution is as yet unknown to us.","Woe to you, my Princess, when I come. I will kiss you quite red and feed you till you are plump. And if you are froward, you shall see who is the stronger, a gentle little girl who doesn\'t eat enough, or a big wild man who has cocaine in his body. -- A love letter from Freud to his fianc\xe9e.","The psychoanalysis of neurotics has taught us to recognize the intimate connection between wetting the bed and the character trait of ambition.","But the less a man knows about the past and the present the more insecure must prove to be his judgment of the future.","It is no wonder if, under the pressure of these possibilities of suffering, men are accustomed to moderate their claims to happiness - just as the pleasure principle itself, indeed, under the influence of the external world, changed into the more modest reality principle -, if a man thinks himself happy merely to have escaped unhappiness or to have survived his suffering, and if in general the task of avoiding suffering pushes that of obtaining pleasure into the background.","When we attempt to imagine death, we perceive ourselves as spectators.","The essence of analysis is surprise. When people are themselves surprised by what they say, that\'s when they are really making some progress.","Civilized people have exchanged some part of their chances of happiness for a measure of security.","Concerning the factors of silence, solitude and darkness, we can only say that they are actually elements in the production of the infantile anxiety from which the majority of human beings have never become quite free.","Human life in common is only made possible when a majority comes together which is stronger than any separate individual and which remains united against all separate individuals. The power of this community is then set up as right in opposition to the power of the individual, which is condemned as brute force.","Religion is comparable to a childhood neurosis.","Smoking is indispensable if one has nothing to kiss.","Pathology has made us acquainted with a great number of states in which the boundary lines between the ego and the external world become uncertain or in which they are actually drawn incorrectly. There are cases in which parts of a person\'s own body, even portions of his own mental life - his perceptions, thoughts and feelings -, appear alien to him and as not belonging to his ego; there are other cases in which he ascribes to the external world things that clearly originate in his own ego and that ought to be acknowledged by it.","In some place in my soul, in a very hidden corner, I am a fanatical Jew. I am very much astonished to discover myself as such in spite of all efforts to be unprejudiced and impartial. What can I do against it at my age?","He does not believe that does not live according to his belief.","If the truth of religious doctrines is dependent on an inner experience that bears witness to the truth, what is one to make of the many people who do not have that experience?","The pleasure of satisfying a savage instinct, undomesticated by the ego, is uncomparably much more intense than the one of satisfying a tamed instinct. The reason is becoming the enemy that prevents us from a lot of possibilities of pleasure.","Thus we arrive at the singular conclusion that of all the information passed by our cultural assets it is precisely the elements which might be of the greatest importance to us and which have the task of solving the riddles of the universe and of reconciling us to the sufferings of life -- it is precisely those elements that are the least well authenticated of any.","A piece of creative writing, like a day-dream, is a continuation of, and a substitute for, what was once the play of childhood.","We have long observed that every neurosis has the result, and therefore probably the purpose, of forcing the patient out of real life, of alienating him from actuality.","America is a mistake, admittedly a gigantic mistake, but a mistake nevertheless.","Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness.","No matter how much restriction civilization imposes on the individual, he nevertheless finds some way to circumvent it. Wit is the best safety valve modern man has evolved; the more civilization, the more repression, the more need there is for wit.\\".","Like the physical, the psychical is not necessarily in reality what it appears to us to be.","One... gets an impression that civilization is something which was imposed on a resisting majority by a minority which understood how to obtain possession of the means to power and coercion. It is, of course, natural to assume that these difficulties are not inherent in the nature of civilization itself but are determined by the imperfections of the cultural forms which have so far been developed.","Sadism is all right in its place, but it should be directed to proper ends.","No one who, like me, conjures up the most evil of those half-tamed demons that inhabit the human breast, and seeks to wrestle with them, can expect to come through the struggle unscathed.","No, our science is no illusion. But an illusion it would be to suppose that what science cannot give us we can get elsewhere.","But the repressed merges into the id as well, and is merely a part of it. The repressed is only cut off sharply from the ego by the resistances of repression; it can communicate with the ego through the id.","I consider it a good rule for letter-writing to leave unmentioned what the recipient already knows, and instead tell him something new.","\\"He sido un hombre afortunado en la vida, nada me ha sido facil.\\"    \\"I\'ve been a fortunate man in life, nothing has come easy\\"","No one who has seen a baby sinking back satiated from the breast and falling asleep with flushed cheeks and a blissful smile can escape the reflection that this picture persists as a prototype of the expression of sexual satisfaction in later life.","The dream unites the grossest contradictions, permits impossibilities, sets aside the knowledge that influences us by day, and exposes us as ethically and morally obtuse.","Men have gained control over the forces of nature to such an extent that with their help they would have no difficulty exterminating one another to the last man. They know this, and hence comes a large part of their current unrest, their unhappiness and their mood of anxiety.","In general people experience their present naively, as it were, without being able to form an estimate of its contents; they have first to put themselves at a distance from it - the present, that is to say, must have become the past - before it can yield points of vantage from which to judge the future.","The pleasure principle long persists, however, as the method of working employed by the sexual instincts, which are so hard to \'educate\', and, starting from those instincts, or in the ego itself, it often succeeds in overcoming the reality principle, to the detriment of the organism as a whole.","By abolishing private property one deprives the human love of aggression.","At bottom God is nothing more than an exalted father.","There are no mistakes.","The conscious mind may be compared to a fountain playing in the sun and falling back into the great subterranean pool of subconscious from which it rises.","Only the real, rare, true scientific minds can endure doubt, which is attached to all our knowledge.","Neurosis is the result of a conflict between the ego and its id, whereas psychosis is the analogous outcome of a similar disturbance in the relation between the ego and the external world.","A love that does not discriminate seems to me to forfeit a part of its own value, by doing an injustice to its object; and secondly, not all men are worthy of love.","At first the analysing physician could do no more than discover the unconscious material that was concealed from the patient, put it together, and, at the right moment, communicate it to him. Psychoanalysis was then first and foremost an art of interpreting. Since this did not solve the therapeutic problem, a further aim quickly came in view: to oblige the patient to confirm the analyst\'s construction from his own memory.","I was making frequent use of cocaine at that time ... I had been the first to recommend the use of cocaine, in 1885, and this recommendation had brought serious reproaches down on me.","I cannot face the idea of life without work. What would one do when ideas failed or words refused to come? It is impossible not to shudder at the thought.","In the development of mankind as a whole, just as in individuals, love alone acts as the civilizing factor in the sense that it brings a change from egoism to altruism.","Tobacco is the only excuse for Columbus\'s misadventure in discovering America.","The unconscious - that is to say, the \'repressed\' - offers no resistance whatever to the efforts of the treatment. Indeed, it itself has no other endeavour than to break through the pressure weighing down on it and force its way either to consciousness or to a discharge through some real action.","A certain degree of neurosis is of inestimable value as a drive, especially to a psychologist.","Our unconscious, then, does not believe in its own death; it behaves as if it were immortal. It knows nothing that is negative; in it contradictories coincide. This may be the secret of heroism.","Only a good-for-nothing is not interested in his past.","Now it is nothing but torture.","public self is a conditioned construct of the inner psychological self.","The poor ego has a still harder time of it; it has to serve three harsh masters, and it has to do its best to reconcile the claims and demands of all three...The three tyrants are the external world, the superego, and the id.","Where such men love they have no desire and where they desire they cannot love","In the last analysis the entire field of psychology may reduce to biological electrochemistry.","Yes, America is gigantic, but a gigantic mistake.","It is easy to see that the ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world.","There is no doubt that the resistance of the conscious and unconscious ego operates under the sway of the pleasure principle: it seeks to avoid the unpleasure which would be produced by the liberation of the repressed.","The facts which have caused us to believe in the dominance of the pleasure principle in mental life also find expression in the hypothesis that the mental apparatus endeavours to keep the quantity of excitation present in it as low as possible or at least to keep it constant.","The motive forces of phantasies are unsatisfied wishes, and every single phantasy is the fulfillment of a wish, a correction of unsatisfying reality.","The effect of the consolations of religion may be compared to that of a narcotic.","Free sexual intercourse between young males and respectable girls\\" was urgently necessary or society was \\"doomed to fall a victim to incurable neuroses which reduce the enjoyment of life to a minimum, destroy the marriage relation and bring hereditary ruin on the whole coming generation.","These patients have turned away from outer reality; it is for this reason that they are more aware than we of inner reality and can reveal to us things which without them would remain impenetrable.","It would be very nice if there were a God who created the world and was a benevolent providence, and if there were a moral order in the universe and an after-life; but it is a very striking fact that all this is exactly as we are bound to wish it to be.","The first requisite of civilization, therefore, is that of justice \u2014 that is, the assurance that a law once made will not be broken in favour of an individual. This implies nothing as to the ethical value of such a law.","I do not doubt that it would be easier for fate to take away your suffering than it would for me. But you will see for yourself that much has been gained if we succeed in turning your hysterical misery into common unhappiness.","No other technique for the conduct of life attaches the individual so firmly to reality as laying emphasis on work; for his work at least gives him a secure place in a portion of reality, in the human community.","Intelligence will be used in the service of the neurosis.","There is an intellectual function in us which demands unity, connection and intelligibility from any material, whether of perception or thought, that comes within its grasp; and if, as a result of special circumstances, it is unable to establish a true connection, it does not hesitate to fabricate a false one.","One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be \'happy\' is not included in the plan of Creation.\' . . . We are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from a state of things.","The game replaces sexual enjoyment by pleasure in movement.","I am not aware, however, that patients suffering from traumatic neurosis are much occupied in their waking lives with memories of their accident. Perhaps they are more concerned with not thinking of it.","The different religions have never overlooked the part played by the sense of guilt in civilization. What is more, they come forward with a claim...to save mankind from this sense of guilt, which they call sin.","The voice of the intellect is a soft one, but it does not rest until it has gained a hearing.","In almost every place where we find totems we also find a law against persons of the same totem having sexual relations with one another and consequently against their marrying. This, then, is \'exogamy\', an institution related to totemism.","I have no concern with any economic criticisms of the communist system; I cannot inquire into whether the abolition of private property is expedient or advantageous. But I am able to recognize that the psychological premisses on which the system is based are an untenable illusion. In abolishing private property we deprive the human love of aggression of one of its instruments... but we have in no way altered the differences in power and influence which are misused by aggressiveness.","The dream acts as a safety-valve for the over-burdened brain.","A string of reproaches against other people leads one to suspect the existence of a string of self-reproaches with the same content.","There is to my mind no doubt that the concept of beautiful had its roots in sexual excitation and that its original meaning was sexually stimulating.","What is common in all these dreams is obvious. They completely satisfy wishes excited during the day which remain unrealized. They are simply and undisguisedly realizations of wishes.","Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God. When he puts on all his auxiliary organs, he is truly magnificent; but those organs have not grown on him and they still give him much trouble at times.","The goal towards which the pleasure principle impels us - of becoming happy - is not attainable: yet we may not - nay, cannot - give up the efforts to come nearer to realization of it by some means or other.","The study of dreams may be considered the most trustworthy method of investigating deep mental processes. Now dreams occurring in traumatic neuroses have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident, a situation from which he wakes up in another fright.","Every man has a right over his own life and war destroys lives that were full of promise; it forces the individual into situations that shame his manhood, obliging him to murder fellow men, against his will.","As everyone knows, the ancients before Aristotle did not consider the dream a product of the dreaming mind, but a divine inspiration, and in ancient times the two antagonistic streams, which one finds throughout in the estimates of dream life, were already noticeable. They distinguished between true and valuable dreams, sent to the dreamer to warn him or to foretell the future, and vain, fraudulent, and empty dreams, the object of which was to misguide or lead him to destruction.","Loneliness and darkness have just robbed me of my valuables.","After all, we did not invent symbolism; it is a universal age-old activity of the human imagination.","Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires.","Civilization has little to fear from educated people and brain-workers. In them the replacement of religious motives for civilized behaviors by other, secular motives, would proceed unobtrusively. . . .","dream is the dreamer\'s own psychical act.","A state of consciousness is characteristically very transitory; an idea that is conscious now is no longer so a moment later, although it can become so again under certain conditions that are easily brought about.","The psychic development of the individual is a short repetition of the course of development of the race.","Opposition is not necessarily enmity; it is merely misused and made an occasion for enmity.","A strong experience in the present awakens in the creative writer a memory of an earlier experience (usually belonging to his childhood) from which there now proceeds a wish which finds its fulfilment in the creative work.","All elongated objects, such as sticks, tree-trunks and umbrellas(the opening of these last being comparable to an erection) may stand for the male organ...Boxes, cases, chests, cupboards, and ovens represent the uterus...Rooms in dreams are usually women...Many landscapes in dreams, especially any containing breidges or wooded hills, may clearly be recognized as descriptions of the genitals.","An overwhelming majority of symbols in dreams are sexual symbols.","Christmas is the alcoholidays","The rest of our enquiry is made easy because this God-Creator is openly called Father. Psycho-analysis concludes that he really is the father, clothed in the grandeur in which he once appeared to the small child.","Long ago man formed an ideal conception of omnipotence and omniscience which he embodied in his gods. Whatever seemed unattainable to his desires - or forbidden to him - he attributed to these gods... Now he has himself approached very near to realizing this ideal, he has nearly become a god himself.","But one thing about human beings puzzles me the most is their conscious effort to be connected with the object of their affection even if it kills them slowly within.","The religions of mankind must be classed among the mass-delusions of this kind. No one, needless to say, who shares a delusion ever recognizes it as such.","Even if all parts of a problem seem to fit together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, one has to remember that the probable need not necessarily be the truth and the truth not always probable.","What is a totem? It is as a rule an animal (whether edible and harmless or dangerous and feared) and more rarely a plant or a natural phenomenon (such as rain or water), which stands in a peculiar relation to the whole clan. In the first place, the totem is the common ancestor of the clan; at the same time it is their guardian spirit and helper, which sends them oracles and, if dangerous to others, recognizes and spares its own children.","In so doing, the idea forces itself upon him that religion is comparable to a childhood neurosis, and he is optimistic enough to suppose that mankind will surmount this neurotic phase, just as so many children grow out of their similar neurosis.","An intimate friend and a hated enemy have always been indispensable requirements for my emotional life; I have always been able to create them anew, and not infrequently my childish ideal has been so closely approached that friend and enemy coincided in the same person.","I have often felt as though I had inherited all the defiance and all the passions with which our ancestors defended their Temple and could gladly sacrifice my life for one great moment in history. And at the same time I always felt so helpless and incapable of expressing these ardent passions even by a word or a poem.","The liberty of the individual is no gift of civilization. It was greatest before there was any civilization, though then, it is true, it had for the most part no value, since the individual was scarcely in a position to defend it. The development of civilization imposes restrictions on it, and justice demands that no one shall escape those restrictions.","Nature delights in making use of the same forms in the most various biological connections: as it does, for instance, in the appearance of branch-like structures both in coral and in plants, and indeed in some forms of crystal and in certain chemical precipitates.","Towards the outside, at any rate, the ego seems to maintain clear and sharp lines of demarcation. There is only one state -- admittedly an unusual state, but not one that can be stigmatized as pathological -- in which it does not do this. At the height of being in love the boundary between ego and object threatens to melt away. Against all the evidence of his senses, a man who is in love declares that \\"I\\" and \\"you\\" are one, and is prepared to behave as if it were a fact.","We believe that civilization has been created under the pressure of the exigencies of life at the cost of satisfaction of the instincts.","It often seems that the poet\'s derisive comment is not unjustified when he says of the philosopher: \u201cWith his nightcaps and the tatters of his dressing-gown he patches the gaps in the structure of the universe.","The functional importance of the ego is manifested in the fact that normally control over the approaches to motility devolves upon it. Thus in its relation to the id it is like a man on horse back, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with his own strength while the ego uses borrowed forces.","Religion [is] the universal obsessional neurosis of humanity","The most ancient and important taboo prohibitions are the two basic laws of totemism: not to kill the totem animal and to avoid sexual intercourse with members of the totem clan of the opposite sex.","We know less about the sexual life of little girls than of boys. But we need not feel ashamed of this distinction; after all, the sexual life of adult women is a \'dark continent\' for psychology.","Sexual morality - as society in its extreme form, the American, defines it - is contemptible. I advocate an incomparably freer sexual life.","Taboo restrictions are distinct from religious or moral prohibitions. They are not based upon any divine ordinance, but may be said to impose themselves on their own account. They differ from moral prohibitions in that they fall into no system that declares quite generally that certain abstinences must be observed and gives reasons for that necessity.","The division of the psychical into what is conscious and what is unconscious is the fundamental premise of psycho-analysis; and it alone makes it possible for psycho-analysis to understand the pathological processes in mental life, which are as common as they are important, and to find a place for them in the framework of science.","The analytic psychotherapist thus has a threefold battle to wage -- in his own mind against the forces which seek to drag him down from the analytic level; outside the analysis, against opponents who dispute the importance he attaches to the sexual instinctual forces and hinder him from making use of them in his scientific technique; and inside the analysis, against his patients, who at first behave like opponents but later on reveal the overvaluation of sexual life which dominates them, and who try to make him captive to their socially untamed passion.","In this way the ego detaches itself from the external world. It is more correct to say: Originally the ego includes everything, later it detaches from itself the external world. The ego-feeling we are aware of now is thus only a shrunken vestige of a far more extensive feeling - a feeling which embraced the universe and expressed an inseparable connection of the ego with the external world.","I have an infamously low capacity for visualizing relationships, which made the study of geometry and all subjects derived from it impossible for me.","The whole life of instinct serves the one end of bringing about death.","The Mosaic religion had been a Father religion; Christianity became a Son religion. The old God, the Father, took second place; Christ, the Son, stood in His stead, just as in those dark times every son had longed to do.","The dream is the liberation of the spirit from the pressure of external nature, a detachment of the soul from the fetters of matter.","To endure life remains, when all is said, the first duty of all living being Illusion can have no value if it makes this more difficult for us.","Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc.). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime--and a cruelty, too. If you do not believe me, read the books of Havelock Ellis.","It is unavoidable that if we learn more about a great man\'s life, we shall also hear of occasions on which he has done no better than we, and has in fact come nearer to us as a human being.","My psychoanalysis has equipped you with the equivalent of a train ticket to recovery. It is now your decision whether or not you choose to make full use of it.","In every age immorality has found no less support in religion than morality has. If the achievements of religion in respect to man\'s happiness, susceptibility to culture and moral control are no better than this, the question cannot but arise whether we are not overrating its necessity for mankind, and whether we do wisely in basing our cultural demands upon it.","A transference neurosis corresponds to a conflict between ego and id, a narcissistic neurosis corresponds to that between between ego and super-ego, and a psychosis to that between ego and outer world.","It could be ventured to understand obsessive compulsive neurosis as the pathological counterpart of religious development, to define neurosis as an individual religiosity; to define religion as a universal obsessive compulsive neurosis.","The liberty of the individual is no gift of civilization. It was greatest before there was any civilization.","Neurotics complain of their illness, but they make the most of it, and when it comes to taking it away from them they will defend it like a lioness her young.","[The child] takes his play very seriously and he expends large amounts of emotion on it. The opposite of play is not what is serious but what is real.","The expectation that every neurotic phenomenon can be cured may, I suspect, be derived from the layman\'s belief that the neuroses are something quite unnecessary which have no right whatever to exist. Whereas in fact they are severe, constitutionally fixed illnesses, which rarely restrict themselves to only a few attacks but persist as a rule over long periods throughout life.","When a man has once brought himself to accept uncritically all the absurdities that religious doctrines put before him and even to overlook the contradictions between them, we need not be greatly suprised at the weakness of his intellect.","The ego is first and foremost a bodily ego; it is not merely a surface entity, but is itself the projection of a surface. If we wish to find an anatomical analogy for it we can best identify it with the \'cortical homunculus\' of the anatomists, which stands on its head in the cortex, sticks up its heels, faces","A lady once expressed herself in society - the very words show that they were uttered with fervour and under the pressure of a great many secret emotions: \\"Yes, a woman must be pretty if she is to please the men. A man is much better off. As long as he has five straight limbs, he needs no more!\\"","The genitals themselves have not undergone the development of the rest of the human form in the direction of beauty.","The communal life of human beings had . . . a two-fold foundation: the compulsion to work, which was created by external necessity, and the power of love.","It almost looks like analysis were the third of those \'impossible\' professions in which one can be quite sure of unsatisfying results. The other two, much older-established, are the bringing up of children and the government of nations.","The Devil would be the best way out as an excuse for God; in that way he would be playing the same part as an agent of economic discharge as the Jew does in the world of the Aryan ideal. But even so, one can hold God responsible for the existence of the Devil just as well as for the existence of the wickedness which the Devil embodies.","I regard myself as one of the most dangerous enemies of religion","Thinking is an experimental dealing with small quantities of energy, just as a general moves miniature figures over a map before setting his troops in action.","What progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Now they are content with burning my books.","I think that in general it is a good plan occasionally to bear in mind the fact that people were in the habit of dreaming before there was such a thing as psychoanalysis.","We are so constituted that we can gain intense pleasure only from the contrast, and only very little from the condition itself.","A collection to which nothing can be added and from which nothing can be removed is, in fact, dead!","Love can not be much younger than the lust for murder.","Lead us, Heavenly Father, lead us O\'er the world\'s tempestuous sea; Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us, For we have no help but Thee.","Hatred of Judaism is at bottom hatred of Christianity.","If children could, if adults knew.","I should like to raise the question whether the inevitable stunting of the sense of smell as a result of man\'s turning away from the earth, and the organic repression of the smell-pleasure produced by it, does not largely share in his predisposition to nervous diseases.","Civilization runs a greater risk if we maintain our present attitude to religion than if we give it up.","We should picture the instrument that carries our mental functioning as resembling a compound microscope or photographic apparatus.","The act of birth is the first experience of anxiety, and thus the source and prototype of the affect of anxiety.","Writers write for fame, wealth, power and the love of women.","We have become convinced that it is better to avoid such symbolic disguisings of the truth in what we tell children and not to withhold from them a knowledge of the true state of affairs commensurate with their intellectual level.","It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime, and cruelty too","We may say that hysteria is a caricature of an artistic creation, a compulsion neurosis a caricature of a religion, and a paranoiac delusion a caricature of a philosophic system.","Innately, children seem to have little true realistic anxiety. They will run along the brink of water, climb on the window sill, play with sharp objects and with fire, in short, do everything that is bound to damage them and to worry those in charge of them, that is wholly the result of education; for they cannot be allowed to make the instructive experiences themselves.","There is scarcely room for doubt that something in the psychological relation of a mother-in-law to a son-in-law breeds hostility between them and makes it hard for them to live together. But the fact that in civilized societies mothers-in-law are such a favourite subject for jokes seems to me to suggest that the emotional relation involved includes sharply contrasted components. I believe, that is, that this relation is in fact an \'ambivalent\' one, composed of conflicting affectionate and hostile impulses.","I do not think our successes can compete with those of Lourdes. There are so many more people who believe in the miracles of the Blessed Virgin than in the existence of the unconscious.","The three major mother gods of the Eastern populations seemed to be generating and destroying entities at the same time; both goddesses of life and fertility as well as goddesses of death.","One must not be mean with affections; what is spent of the funds is renewed in the spending itself. Left untouched for too long, they diminish imperceptibly or the lock gets rusty; they are there all right but one cannot make use of them.","One might compare the relation of the ego to the id with that between a rider and his horse. The horse provides the locomotor energy, and the rider has the prerogative of determining the goal and of guiding the movements of his powerful mount towards it. But all too often in the relations between the ego and the id we find a picture of the less ideal situation in which the rider is obliged to guide his horse in the direction in which it itself wants to go.","The defense against childish helplessness is what lends its characteristic features to the adult\'s reaction to the helplessness which he has to acknowledge - a reaction which is precisely the formation of religion.","Neither in my private life nor in my writings, have I ever made a secret of being an out-and-out unbeliever.","It sounds not only disagreeable but also paradoxical, yet it must nevertheless be said that anyone who is to be really free and happy in love must have surmounted his respect for women and have come to terms with the idea of incest with his mother or sister.","The idea of men\'s receiving an intimation of their connection with the world around them through an immediate feeling which is from the outset directed to that purpose sounds so strange and fits in so badly with the fabric of our psychology that one is justified in attempting to discover a psycho-analytic - that is, a genetic - explanation of such a feeling.","It is unreasonable to expect science to produce a system of ethics-ethics are a kind of highway code for traffic among mankind-and the fact that in physics atoms which were yesterday assumed to be square are now assumed to be round is exploited with unjustified tendentiousness by all who are hungry for faith; so long as physics extends our dominion over nature, these changes ought to be a matter of complete indifference to you.","This transmissibility of taboo is a reflection of the tendency, on which we have already remarked, for the unconscious instinct in the neurosis to shift constantly along associative paths on to new objects.","all the categories which we employ to describe conscious mental acts, such as ideas, purposes, resolutions, and so on, can be applied tothese latent states.","Analogies, it is true, decide nothing, but they can make one feel more at home.","The assumption that everything past is preserved holds good even in mental life only on condition that the organ of the mind has remained intact and that its tissues have not been damaged by trauma or inflammation. But destructive influences which can be compared to causes of illness like these are never lacking in the history of a city, even if it has had a less chequered past than Rome, and even if, like London, it has hardly ever suffered from the visitations of an enemy.","The transformation of object-libido into narcissistic libido which thus takes place obviously implies an abandonment of sexual aims, a desexualization - a kind of sublimation, therefore.","I do not in the least underestimate bisexuality... I expect it to provide all further enlightenment.","My way of working was different years ago. I used to wait until an idea came to me. Now I go half-way to meet it, though I don\'t know whether I find it any the quicker.","The reproaches against science for not having yet solved the problems of the universe are exaggerated in an unjust and malicious manner; it has truly not had time enough yet for these great achievements. Science is very young--a human activity which developed late.","I like to avoid concessions to faint-heartedness. One can never tell where that road may lead one; one gives way first in words, and then little by little in substance too.","When the wayfarer whistles in the dark, he may be disavowing his timidity, but he does not see any the more clearly for doing so.","Only a rebuke that \'has something in it\' will sting, will have the power to stir our feelings, not the other sort, as we know.","Adolescent stage in the development of the human race from which humanity should free itself.","The sexual wishes in regard to the mother become more intense and the father is perceived as an obstacle to the; this gives rise to the Oedipus complex.","Analysis does not set out to make pathological reactions impossible, but to give the patient\'s ego freedom to decide one way or another.","Religion is an attempt to get control over the sensory world, in which we are placed, by means of the wish-world, which we have developed inside us as a result of biological and psychological necessities... If one attempts to assign to religion its place in man\'s evolution, it seems not so much to be a lasting acquisition, as a parallel to the neurosis which the civilized individual must pass through on his way from childhood to maturity.","Psycho-analysis has taught us that a boy\'s earliest choice of objects for his love is incestuous and that those objects are forbidden ones - his mother and his sister. We have learnt, too, the manner in which, as he grows up, he liberates himself from this incestuous attraction. A neurotic, on the other hand, invariably exhibits some degree of psychical infantilism. He has either failed to get free from the psychosexual conditions that prevailed in his childhood or he has returned to them - two possibilities which may be summed up as developmental inhibition and regression.","If one wishes to form a true estimate of the full grandeur of religion, one must keep in mind what it undertakes to do for men. It gives them information about the source and origin of the universe, it assures them of protection and final happiness, and it guides - by - precepts - backed by the full force of its authority.","An unrestricted satisfaction of every need presents itself as the most enticing method of conducting one\'s life, but it means putting enjoyment before caution, and soon brings its own punishment.","...perhaps the hopes I have confessed to are of an illusory nature, too. But I hold fast to one distinction. Apart from the fact that no penalty is imposed for not sharing them, my illusions are not, like religious ones, incapable of correction.","Religion: Something comparable to childhood neurosis","One becomes gradually accustomed to a new realization of the nature of \'happiness\': one has to assume happiness when Fate does not carry out all its threats simultaneously.","To be sure, the ancient belief that the dream reveals the future is not entirely devoid of truth. By representing to us a wish as fulfilled the dream certainly leads us into the future; but this future, taken by the dreamer as present, has been formed into the likeness of that past by the indestructible wish.","What psycho-analysis reveals in the transference phenomena of neurotics can also be observed in the lives of some normal people. The impression they give is of being pursued by a malignant fate or possessed by some \'daemonic\' power; but psycho-analysis has always taken the view that their fate is for the most part arranged by themselves and determined by early infantile influences.","If all the evidence put forward for the authenticity of religious teachings originates in the past, it is natural to look round and see whether the present, about which it is easier to form judgements, may not also be able to furnish evidence of the sort. If by this means we could succeed in clearing even a single portion of the religious system from doubt, the whole of it would gain enormously in credibility.","Another technique for fending off suffering is the employment of the displacements of libido which our mental apparatus permits of and through which its function gains so much in flexibility. The task here is that of shifting the instinctual aims in such a way that they cannot come up against frustration from the external world.","Obsessional prohibitions are extremely liable to displacement. They extend from one object to another along whatever paths the context may provide, and this new object then becomes, to use the apt expression of one of my women patients, \'impossible\' - till at last the whole world lies under an embargo of \'impossibility\'.","A child in its greed for love does not enjoy having to share the affection of its parents with its brothers and sisters; and it notices that the whole of their affection is lavished upon it once more whenever it arouses their anxiety by falling ill. It has now discovered a means of enticing out its parents\' love and will make use of that means as soon as it has the necessary psychical material at its disposal for producing an illness.","Plaque was placed on 6 May 1977 at Bellevue (a house on the slopes of the Wienerwald) where the Freud family spent their summers.","I no longer believe that William Shakespeare the actor from Stratford was the author of the works that have been ascribed to him.","Religious doctrines \u2026 are all illusions, they do not admit of proof, and no one can be compelled to consider them as true or to believe in them.","Do you not know how uncontrolled and unreliable the average human being is in all that concerns sexual life?","I have never doubted that religious phenomena are only to be understood on the pattern of the individual neurotic symptoms familiar to us.","Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God.","Our fascination with gold is related to the fantasies of early childhood.","We must reckon with the possibility that something in the nature of the sexual instinct itself is unfavorable to the realization of complete satisfaction.","We are never so defenseless against suffering as when we love.","Religion is an attempt to get control over the sensory world, in which we are placed, by means of the wish-world, which we have developed inside us as a result of biological and psychological necessities. But it cannot achieve its end. Its doctrines carry with them the stamp of the times in which they originated, the ignorant childhood days of the human race. Its consolations deserve no trust. Experience teaches us that the world is not a nursery. The ethical commands, to which religion seeks to lend its weight, require some other foundations instead, for human society cannot do without them, and it is dangerous to link up obedience to them with religious belief. If one attempts to assign to religion its place in man\u2019s evolution, it seems not so much to be a lasting acquisition, as a parallel to the neurosis which the civilized individual must pass through on his way from childhood to maturity.","It is impossible to escape the impression that people commonly use false standards of measurement \u2014 that they seek power, success and wealth for themselves and admire them in others, and that they underestimate what is of true value in life.","Everywhere I go I find a poet has been there before me.","Whoever loves becomes humble. Those who love have , so to speak , pawned a part of their narcissism.","It sounds like a fairy-tale, but not only that; this story of what man by his science and practical inventions has achieved on this earth, where he first appeared as a weakly member of the animal kingdom, and on which each individual of his species must ever again appear as a helpless infant... is a direct fulfilment of all, or of most, of the dearest wishes in his fairy-tales. All these possessions he has acquired through culture. Long ago he formed an ideal conception of omnipotence and omniscience which he embodied in his gods. Whatever seemed unattainable to his desires - or forbidden to him - he attributed to these gods. One may say, therefore, that these gods were the ideals of his culture. Now he has himself approached very near to realizing this ideal, he has nearly become a god himself. But only, it is true, in the way that ideals are usually realized in the general experience of humanity. Not completely; in some respects not at all, in others only by halves. Man has become a god by means of artificial limbs, so to speak, quite magnificent when equipped with all his accessory organs; but they do not grow on him and they still give him trouble at times... Future ages will produce further great advances in this realm of culture, probably inconceivable now, and will increase man\'s likeness to a god still more.","Religion is a system of wishful illusions together with a disavowal of reality, such as we find nowhere else but in a state of blissful hallucinatory confusion. Religion\'s eleventh commandment is \\"Thou shalt not question.","It is that we are never so defenseless against suffering as when we love, never so helplessly unhappy as when we have lost our loved object or its love.","Where the questions of religion are concerned people are guilty of every possible kind of insincerity and intellectual misdemeanor.","Where id is, there shall ego be","The interpretation of Dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind","Poets are masters of us ordinary men, in knowledge of the mind,because they drink at streams which we have not yet made accessible to science.","we are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our body, which is doomed to decay..., from the external world which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless force of destruction, and finally from our relations with other men... This last source is perhaps more painful to use than any other. (p77)","Neurosis is the inability to tolerate ambiguity","Men are strong so long as they represent a strong idea,they become powerless when they oppose it.","How bold one gets when one is sure of being loved","Thus I must contradict you when you go on to argue that men are completely unable to do without the consolation of the religious illusion, that without it they could not bear the troubles of life and the cruelties of reality. That is true, certainly, of the men into whom you have instilled the sweet -- or bitter-sweet -- poison from childhood onwards. But what of the other men, who have been sensibly brought up? Perhaps those who do not suffer from the neurosis will need no intoxicant to deaden it. They will, it is true, find themselves in a difficult situation. They will have to admit to themselves the full extent of their helplessness and their insignificance in the machinery of the universe; they can no longer be the centre of creation, no longer the object of tender care on the part of a beneficent Providence. They will be in the same position as a child who has left the parental house where he was so warm and comfortable. But surely infantilism is destined to be surmounted. Men cannot remain children for ever; they must in the end go out into \'hostile life\'. We may call this \'education to reality. Need I confess to you that the whole purpose of my book is to point out the necessity for this forward step?","There are no mistakes","It goes without saying that a civilization which leaves so large a number of its participants unsatisfied and drives them into revolt neither has nor deserves the prospect of a lasting existence.","Humanity has in the course of time had to endure from the hands of science two great outrages upon its naive self-love. The first was when it realized that our earth was not the center of the universe, but only a tiny speck in a world-system of a magnitude hardly conceivable; this is associated in our minds with the name of Copernicus, although Alexandrian doctrines taught something very similar. The second was when biological research robbed man of his peculiar privilege of having been specially created, and relegated him to a descent from the animal world, implying an ineradicable animal nature in him: this transvaluation has been accomplished in our own time upon the instigation of Charles Darwin, Wallace, and their predecessors, and not without the most violent opposition from their contemporaries. But man\'s craving for grandiosity is now suffering the third and most bitter blow from present-day psychological research which is endeavoring to prove to the ego of each one of us that he is not even master in his own house, but that he must remain content with the veriest scraps of information about what is going on unconsciously in his own mind. We psycho-analysts were neither the first nor the only ones to propose to mankind that they should look inward; but it appears to be our lot to advocate it most insistently and to support it by empirical evidence which touches every man closely.","The more perfect a person is on the outside, the more demons they have on the inside.","The commandment, \'Love thy neighbour as thyself\', is the strongest defence against human aggressiveness and an excellent example of the unpsychological [expectations] of the cultural super-ego. The commandment is impossible to fulfil; such an enormous inflation of love can only lower its value, not get rid of the difficulty. Civilization pays no attention to all this; it merely admonishes us that the harder it is to obey the precept the more meritorious it is to do so. But anyone who follows such a precept in present-day civilization only puts himself at a disadvantage  vis-a-vis  the person who disregards it. What a potent obstacle to civilization aggressiveness must be, if the defence against it can cause as much unhappiness as aggressiveness itself! \'Natural\' ethics, as it is called, has nothing to offer here except the narcissistic satisfaction of being able to think oneself better than others. At this point the ethics based on religion introduces its promises of a better after-life. But so long as virtue is not rewarded here on earth, ethics will, I fancy, preach in vain. I too think it quite certain that a real change in the relations of human beings to possessions would be of more help in this direction than any ethical commands; but the recognition of this fact among socialists has been obscured and made useless for practical purposes by a fresh idealistic misconception of human nature.","Smoking is indispensable if one has nothing to kiss","Woe to you, my Princess, when I come. I will kiss you quite red and feed you till you are plump. And if you are forward, you shall see who is the stronger, a gentle little girl who doesn\'t eat enough, or a big wild man who has cocaine in his body. -- A love letter from Freud to his fianc\xe9e.","We are what we are because we have been what we have been, and what is needed for solving the problems of human life and motives is not moral estimates but more knowledge.","Anatomy is destiny.","He who knows how to wait need make no concessions.","I never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me as a member","Our memory has no guarantees at all, and yet we bow more often than is objectively justified to the compulsion to believe what it says.","And it is only after seeing man as his unconscious, revealed by his dreams, presents him to us that we shall understand him fully. For as Freud said to Putnam: \\"We are what we are because we have been what we have been.","It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built up upon a renunciation of instinct....","Neurosis is the result of a conflict between the ego and its id, whereas psychosis is the analogous outcome of a similar disturbance in the relation between the ego and its environment (outer world).","Everyone owes nature a death.","Words were originally magic, and the word retains much of its old magical power even to-day. With words one man can make another blessed, or drive him to despair; by words the teacher transfers his knowledge to the pupil; by words the speaker sweeps his audience with him and determines its judgments and decisions. Words call forth effects and are the universal means of influencing human beings.","Nothing that is mentally our own can ever be lost.","The patient cannot remember the whole of what is repressed in him, and what he cannot remember may be precisely the essential part of it.. He is obliged to repeat the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of remembering it as something in the past.","I can imagine that the oceanic feeling could become connected with religion later on. That feeling of oneness with the universe which is its ideational content sounds very like a first attempt at the consolations of religion, like another way taken by the ego of denying the dangers it sees threatening it in the external world.","We have learned, for example, that the more virtuous a man is the more severe is his super-ego, and that he blames himself for misfortunes for which he is clearly not responsible.","No other technique for the conduct of life attaches the individual so firmly to reality as laying emphasis on work; for his work at least gives him a secure place in a portion of reality, in the human community. The possibility it offers of displacing a large amount of libidinal components, whether narcissistic, aggressive or even erotic, on to professional work and on to the human relations connected with it lends it a value by no means second to what it enjoys as something indispensible to the preservation and justification of existence in society. Professional activity is a source of special satisfaction if it is a freely chosen one \u2014 if, that is to say, by means of sublimation, it makes possible the use of existing inclinations, of persisting or constitutionally reinforced instinctual impulses. And yet, as a path to happiness, work is not highly prized by men. They do not strive after it as they do after other possibilities of satisfaction. The great majority of people only work under the stress of necessity, and this natural human aversion to work raises most difficult social problems.","No one who, like me, conjures up the most evil of those half-tamed demons that inhabit the human breast, and seeks to wrestle with them, can expect to come through the struggle unscathed","In many criminals, especially youthful ones, it is possible to detect a very powerful sense of guilt which existed before the crime, and is therefore not its result but its motive. It is as if it was a relief to be able to fasten this unconscious sense of guilt on to something real and immediate.","We need not deplore the renunciation of historical truth when we put forward rational grounds for the precepts of civilization. The truths contained in religious doctrines are after all so distorted and systematically disguised that the mass of humanity cannot recognize them as truth. The case is similar to what happens when we tell a child that new-born babies are brought by the stork. Here, too, we are telling the truth in symbolic clothing, for we  know what the large bird signifies . But the child does not know it. He hears only the distorted part of what we say, and feels that he has been deceived; and we know how often his distrust of the grown-ups and his refractoriness actually take their start from this impression. We have become convinced that it is better to avoid such symbolic disguisings of the truth in what we tell children and not to withhold from them a knowledge of the true state of affairs commensurate with their intellectual level.","Life is impoverished, it loses in interest, when the highest stake in the game of living, life itself, may not be risked. It becomes as shallow and empty as, let us say, an American flirtation.","Neurosis is no excuse for bad manners.","The weakness of my position does not imply a strengthening of yours.","The freeing of an individual, as he grows up, from the authority of his parents is one of the most necessary though one of the most painful results brought about by the course of his development. It is quite essential that that liberation should occur and it may be presumed that it has been to some extent achieved by everyone who has reached a normal state. Indeed, the whole progress of society rests upon the opposition between successive generations. On the other hand, there is a class of neurotics whose condition is recognizably determined by their having failed in this task.","If we turn to those restrictions that only apply to certain classes of society, we encounter a state of things which is glaringly obvious and has always been recognized. It is to be expected that the neglected classes will grudge the favoured ones their privileges and that they will do everything in their to power to rid themselves of their own surplus of privation. Where this is not possible a lasting measure of discontent will obtain within this culture, and this may lead to dangerous outbreaks. But if a culture has not got beyond the stage in which the satisfaction of one group of its members necessarily involves the suppression of another, perhaps the majority---and this is the case in all modern cultures,---it is intelligible that these suppressed classes should develop an intense hostility to the culture; a culture, whose existence they make possible by their labour, but in whose resources they have too small a share. In such conditions one must not expect to find an internalization of the cultural prohibitions among the suppressed classes; indeed they are not even prepared to acknowledge these prohibitions, intent, as they are, on the destruction of the culture itself and perhaps even of the assumptions on which it rests. These classes are so manifestly hostile to culture that on that account the more latent hostility of the better provided social strata has been overlooked. It need not be said that a culture which leaves unsatisfied and drives to rebelliousness so large a number of its members neither has a prospect of continued existence, nor deserves it.","Places are often treated like persons.","I do not in the least underestimate bisexuality. . . I expect it to provide all further enlightenment.","All neurotics, and many others besides, take exception to the fact that \'inter urinas et faeces nascimur.","Homo homini lupus [man is wolf to man]. Who in the face of all his experience of life and of history, will have the courage to dispute this assertion?","I may now add that civilization is a process in the service of Eros, whose purpose is to combine single human individuals, and after that families, then races, peoples and nations, into one great unity, the unity of mankind.","Men are not gentle creatures who want to be loved, and who at the most can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary, creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressiveness. As a result, their neighbor is for them not only a potential helper or sexual object, but also someone who tempts them to satisfy their aggressiveness on him, to exploit his capacity for work without compensation, to use him sexually without his consent, to seize his possessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain, to torture and to kill him. Homo homini lupus [man is wolf to man]. Who, in the face of all his experience of life and of history, will have the courage to dispute this assertion?","The element of truth behind all this, which people are so ready to disavow, is that men are not gentle creatures who want to be loved, and who at the most can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary, creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressiveness.","The woman who refuses to see her sexual organs as mere wood chips, designed to make the man\'s life more comfortable, is in danger of becoming a lesbian--an active, phallic woman, an intellectual virago with a fire of her own .... The lesbian body is a particularly pernicious and depraved version of the female body in general; it is susceptible to auto-eroticism, clitoral pleasure and self-actualization.","Dream\'s evanescence, the way in which, on awakening, our thoughts thrust it aside as something bizarre, and our reminiscences mutilating or rejecting it\u2014all these and many other problems have for many hundred years demanded answers which up till now could never have been satisfactory.","Dreams are never concerned with trivia.","The distortion of a text resembles a murder: the difficulty is not in perpetrating the deed, but in getting rid of its traces.","We believe that it is possible for scientific work to gain some knowledge about the reality of the world, by means of which we can increase out power and in accordance with which we can arrange our life. If this belief is an illusion, then we are in the same position as you. But science has given us evidence by its numerous and important successes that it is no illusion.","Perhaps the hopes I have confessed to are of an illusory nature, too. But I hold fast to one distinction. Apart from the fact that no penalty is imposed for not sharing them, my illusions are not, like religious ones, incapable of correction.","For there is a way back from imagination to reality and that is\u2014art.","Suffering comes from three quarters: from our own body, which is destined to decay and dissolution, and cannot even dispense with anxiety and pain as danger-signals; from the outer world, which can rage against us with the most powerful and pitiless forces of destruction; and finally from our relations with other men.","The dream has a very striking way of dealing with the category of opposites and contradictions. This is simply disregarded. To the dream \'No\' does not seem to exist. In particular, it prefers to draw opposites together into a unity or to represent them as one. Indeed, it also takes the liberty of representing some random element by its wished-for opposite, so that at first one cannot tell which of the possible poles is meant positively or negatively in the dream-thoughts.","And, finally, groups have never thirsted aftertruth. They demand illusions, and cannot do without them. They constantly give what is unreal precedenceover what is real; they are almost as strongly influencedby what is untrue as by what is true. Theyhave an evident tendency not to distinguish betweenthe two.","Theoretical considerations require that what is to-day the object of a phobia must at one time in the past have been the source of a high degree of pleasure.","Whoever possesses something that is at once valuable and fragile is afraid of other people\'s envy, in so far as he projects on to them the envy he would have felt in their place.","It is that we are never so defenceless against suffering as when we love, never so helplessly unhappy as when we have lost our loved object or its love.","The sheer size too, the excessive abundance, scale, and exaggeration of dreams could be an infantile characteristic. The most ardent wish of children is to grow up and get as big a share of everything as the grown-ups; they are hard to satisfy; do not know the meaning of \u2018enough.","This is one race of people for whom psychoanalysis is of no use whatsoever. [speaking about the Irish]","Human life should not be considered as the proper material for wild experiments.","When a man has once brought himself to accept uncritically all the absurdities that religious doctrines put before him and even to overlook the contradictions between them, we need not be greatly surprised at the weakness of his intellect.","Here is yet another important consideration forhelping us to understand the individual in a group:Moreover, by the mere fact that he forms part ofan organised group, a man descends several rungsin the ladder of civilization. Isolated, he may be acultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian\u2014that is, a creature acting by instinct.

As a substitute for a longing for the father, it contains the germ from which all religions have evolved.","If you want to expel religion from our European civilization, you can only do it by means of another system of doctrines; and such a system would from the outset take over all the psychological characteristics of religion\u2014the same sanctity, rigidity and intolerance, the same prohibition of thought\u2014for its own defence. You have to have something of the kind in order to meet the requirements of education. And you cannot do without education.","\u2026much will be gained if we succeed in transforming your hysterical misery into common unhappiness.

Words call forth effects and are the universal means of influencing human beings.","One thus gets an impression that civilization is something which was imposed on a resisting majority by a minority which understood how to obtain possession of the means to power and coercion. It is, of course, natural to assume that these difficulties are not inherent in the nature or civilization itself but are determined by the imperfections of the cultural forms which have so far been developed. And in fact it is not difficult to indicate those defects. While mankind has made continual advances in its control over nature and may expect to make still greater ones, it is not possible to establish with certainty that a similar advance has been made in the management of human affairs; and probably at all periods, just as now once again, many people have asked themselves whether what little civilization has thus acquired is indeed worth defending at all. One would think that a re-ordering of human relations should be possible, which would remove the sources of dissatisfaction with civilization by renouncing coercion and the suppression of the instincts, so that, undisturbed by internal discord, men might devote themselves to the acquisition of wealth and its enjoyment. That would be a golden age, but it is questionable if such a state of affairs can be realized. It seems rather that every civilization must be built upon coercion and renunciation of instinct; it does not even seem certain that if coercion were to cease the majority of human beings would be prepared to undertake to perform the work necessary for acquiring new wealth. One has, I think, to reckon with the fact that there are present in all men destructive, and therefore anti-social and anti-cultural, trends and that in a great number of people these are strong enough to determine their behavior in human society.","We tell ourselves how lovely it would be, would it not, if there were a God who created the universe and benign Providence, a moral world order, and life beyond the grave, yet it is very evident, is it not, that all of this is the way we should inevitably wish it to be. And it would be even more remarkable if our poor, ignorant bondsman ancestors had managed to solve all these difficult cosmic questions.","Every man has a right over his own life and war destroys lives that were full of promise; it forces the individual into situations that shame his manhood, obliging him to murder fellow men, against his will.Sigmund Freud wrote to Albert Einstein\u201d","\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0646\u0638\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u063a\u0632\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0644\u0645 , \u0644\u0627\u0628\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0630\u0643\u0631\u0649 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0629 !","Many of us will also find it hard to abandon our belief that in man himself there dwells an impulse towards perfection, which has brought him to his present heights of intellectual prowess and ethical sublimation, and from which it might be expected that his development into superman will be ensured. But I do not believe in the existence of such an inner impulse, and I see no way of preserving this pleasing illusion. The development of man up to now does not seem to me to need any explanation differing from that of animal development, and the restless striving towards further perfection which may be observed in a minority of human beings is easily explicable as the result of that repression of instinct upon which what is most valuable in human culture is built.","According to the prevailing view human sexual life consists essentially in an endeavor to bring one\'s own genitals into contact with those of someone of the opposite sex.","Actually, the substitution of the reality-principle for the pleasure-principle denotes no dethronement of the pleasure-principle, but only a safeguarding of it. A momentary pleasure, uncertain in its results, is given up, but only in order to gain in the new way an assured pleasure coming later. But the end psychic impression made by this substitution has been so powerful that it is mirrored in a special religious myth. The doctrine of reward in a future life for the\u2014voluntary or enforced\u2014renunciation of earthly lusts is nothing but a mythical projection of this revolution in the mind. In logical pursuit of this prototype, religions have been able to effect the absolute renunciation of pleasure in this life by means of the promise of compensation in a future life; they have not, however, achieved a conquest of the pleasure-principle this way. It is science which comes nearest to succeeding in this conquest; science, however, also offers intellectual pleasure during its work and promises practical gain at the end.","The child is brought up to know its social duties by means of a system of love-rewards and punishments, and in this way it is taught that its security in life depends on its parents (and, subsequently, other people) loving it and being able to believe in its love for them.","That which he projects ahead of him as his ideal, is merely his substitute for the lost narcissism of his childhood - the time when he was his own ideal.","The scope of one\u2019s personality is defined by the magnitude of that problem which is capable of driving a person out of his wits.","Observe the difference between your attitude to illusions and mine. You have to defend the religious illusion with all your might. If it becomes discredited - and indeed the threat to it is great enough - then your world collapses. There is nothing left for you but to despair of everything, of civilization and the future of mankind. From that bondage I am, we are, free. Since we are prepared to renounce a good part of our infantile wishes, we can bear it if a few of our expectations turn out to be illusions.","dreams with a painful content are to be analyzed as the fulfillments of wishes. Nor will it seem a matter of chance that in the course of interpretation one always happens upon subjects of which one does not like to speak or think. The disagreeable sensation which such dreams arouse is simply identical with the antipathy which endeavors\u2014usually with success\u2014to restrain us from the treatment or discussion of such subjects, and which must be overcome by all of us, if, in spite of its unpleasantness, we find it necessary to take the matter in hand. But this disagreeable sensation, which occurs also in dreams, does not preclude the existence of a wish; every one has wishes which he would not like to tell to others, which he does not want to admit even to himself.","Freud said to Putnam: \\"We are what we are because we have been what we have been.","A man like me cannot live without a hobby-horse, a consuming passion \u2014 in Schiller\'s words a tyrant. I have found my tyrant, and in his service I know no limits. My tyrant is psychology. it has always been my distant, beckoning goal and now since I have hit upon the neuroses, it has come so much the nearer.","It only too often yields to the temptation to become sycophantic, opportunist and lying, like a politician who sees the truth but wants to keep his place in popular favour.","A large number of observers acknowledge that dream life is capable of extraordinary achievements\u2014at any rate, in certain fields (\\"Memory\\").","If we throw a crystal to the floor, it breaks; but not into hap-hazard pieces. It comes apart along its lines of cleavage into fragments whose boundaries, thought they were invisible, were predetermined by the crystal\'s structure.

Unheimlich is customarily used, we are told, as the contrary only of the first signification of heimlich, and not of the second. [...] On the other hand, we notice that Schelling says something which throws quite a new light on the concept of the Unheimlich, for which we were certainly not prepared. According to him, everything is unheimlich that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light.","The dream shows how recollections of one\u2019s everyday life can be worked into a structure where one person can be substituted for another, where unacknowledged feelings like envy and guilt can find expression, where ideas can be linked by verbal similarities, and where the laws of logic can be suspended.","Woman ... what does she want?","Trying to be completely sincere with yourself is a good exercise.","An inability to meet the real demands of love is one of the essential characteristics of neurosis; the patients are dominated by the opposition of reality and fantasy. They will flee from what they long for most intensely in their fantasies if they encounter it in real life, and they are most likely to abandon themselves to fantasies when they no longer need to fear their realization.","therapeutic","The element of truth behind all this, which people are so ready to disavow, is that [humans] are not gentle creatures who want to be loved, and who at the most can defend themselves if attacked; they are, on the contrary, creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressiveness. ... It is always possible to bind together a considerable number of people in love, so long as there are other people left over to receive the manifestations of their aggressiveness.","The words which we use in our everyday speech are nothing other than watered-down magic.","But since the downfall of the mythological hypothesis an interpretation of the dream has been wanting. The conditions of its origin; its relationship to our psychical life when we are awake; its independence of disturbances which, during the state of sleep, seem to compel notice; its many peculiarities repugnant to our waking thought; the incongruence between its images and the feelings they engender; then the dream\'s evanescence, the way in which, on awakening, our thoughts thrust it aside as something bizarre, and our reminiscences mutilating or rejecting it\u2014all these and many other problems have for many hundred years demanded answers which up till now could never have been satisfactory. Before all there is the question as to the meaning of the dream, a question which is in itself double-sided. There is, firstly, the psychical significance of the dream, its position with regard to the psychical processes, as to a possible biological function; secondly, has the dream a meaning\u2014can sense be made of each single dream as of other mental syntheses?","Every man must find out for himself in what particular fashion he can be saved.","I am going to the USA to catch sight of a wild porcupine and to give some lectures.","If one of us should die, then I shall move to Paris.","We can postulate that there must be diseases founded on a conflict between ego and super-ego. Analysis gives us the right to infer that melancholia is the model of this group, and then we should put in a claim for the name of \\"narcissistic psychoneuroses\\" for these disorders.","Quite often they are lines of thought starting out from more than one centre, but not without their points of contact; almost invariably one train of thought is accompanied by its contradictory opposite, associatively linked to it by contrast.","We are never so vulnerable as when we love, and never so hopelessly unhappy as when we lose the object of our love.","there is no such thing as an unconscious no.","There is only one state- admittedly an unusual state, but not one that can be stigmatized as pathological- in which it does not do this. At the height of being in love the boundary between ego and object threatens to melt away. Against all the evidence of his senses, a man who is in love declares that \'I\' and \'you\' are one, and is prepared to behave as if it were a fact.","La ciencia moderna a\xfan no ha producido un medicamento tranquilizador tan eficaz como lo son unas pocas palabras bondadosas.","Conscience is the internal perception of the rejection of a particular wish operating in us.","By exposing the hidden dream-thoughts, we have confirmed in general that the dream does continue the motivation and interests of waking life, for dream-thoughts are engaged only with what seems to be important and of great interest to us.","Where does a thought go when it\u2019s forgotten?","Religion has clearly performed great services for human civilization. It has contributed much towards the taming of the asocial instincts. But not enough. It has ruled human society for many thousands of years and has had time to show what it can achieve. If it had succeeded in making the majority of mankind happy, in comforting them, in reconciling them to life and in making them into vehicles of civilization, no one would dream of attempting to alter the existing conditions. But what do we see instead? We see that an appallingly large number of people are dissatisfied with civilization and unhappy in it, and feel it as a yoke which must be shaken off; and that these people either do everything in their power to change that civilization, or else go so far in their hostility to it that they will have nothing to do with civilization or with a restriction of instinct. At this point it will be objected against us that this state of affairs is due to the very fact that religion has lost a part of its influence over human masses precisely because of the deplorable effect of the advances of science. We will note this admission and the reason given for it, and we shall make use of it later for our own purposes; but the objection itself has no force.It is doubtful whether men were in general happier at a time when religious doctrines held unrestricted sway; more moral they certainly were not. They have always known how to externalize the precepts of religion and thus to nullify their intentions. The priests, whose duty it was to ensure obedience to religion, met them half-way in this. God\'s kindness must lay a restraining hand on His justice. One sinned, and then one made a sacrifice or did penance and then one was free to sin once more. Russian introspectiveness has reached the pitch of concluding that sin is indispensable for the enjoyment of all the blessings of divine grace, so that, at bottom, sin is pleasing to God. It is no secret that the priests could only keep the masses submissive to religion by making such large concessions as these to the instinctual nature of man. Thus it was agreed: God alone is strong and good, man is weak and sinful. In every age immorality has found no less support in religion than morality has. If the achievements of religion in respect to man\u2019s happiness, susceptibility to culture and moral control are no better than this, the question cannot but arise whether we are not overrating its necessity for mankind, and whether we do wisely in basing our cultural demands upon it.","Every man is a poet at heart.","It would be an undoubted advantage if we were to leave God out altogether and honestly admit the purely human origin of all the regulations and precepts of civilization. Along with their pretended sanctity, these commandments and laws would lose their rigidity and unchangeableness as well. People could understand that they are made, not so much to rule them as, on the contrary, to serve their interests; and they would adopt a more friendly attitude to them, and instead of aiming at their abolition, would aim only at their improvement.","Human\'s intrinsic nature manifest in it\'s misunderstandings","The ordinary man cannot imagine this Providence in any other form but that of a greatly exalted father, for only such a one could understand the needs of the sons of men, or be softened by their prayers and placated by the signs of their remorse. The whole thing is so patently infantile, so incongruous with reality, that to one whose attitude to humanity is friendly it is painful to think that the great majority of mortals will never be able to rise above this view of life. It is even more humiliating to discover what a large number of those alive today, who must see that this religion is not tenable, yet try to defend it inch by inch, as if with a series of pitiable rearguard actions.","The great question that has never been answered , and which I have not yet been able to answer , despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul , is What does a woman want?","Most of the \'pain\' we experience is of a perceptual order, perception either of the urge of unsatisfied instincts or of something in the external world which may be painful in itself or may arouse painful anticipations in the psychic apparatus and is recognised by it as \'danger.","we can never give up; we only exchange one thing for another","How far back into childhood do our memories reach?","Three tendencies can be observed in the estimation of dreams. Many philosophers have given currency to one of these tendencies, one which at the same time preserves something of the dream\'s former over-valuation. The foundation of dream life is for them a peculiar state of psychical activity, which they even celebrate as elevation to some higher state. Schubert, for instance, claims: \\"The dream is the liberation of the spirit from the pressure of external nature, a detachment of the soul from the fetters of matter.\\" Not all go so far as this, but many maintain that dreams have their origin in real spiritual excitations, and are the outward manifestations of spiritual powers whose free movements have been hampered during the day (\\"Dream Phantasies,\\" Scherner, Volkelt). A large number of observers acknowledge that dream life is capable of extraordinary achievements\u2014at any rate, in certain fields (\\"Memory\\").","Dreaming, in short, is one of the devices we employ to circumvent repression, one of the main methods of what may be called indirect representation in the mind.","\u064a\u0628\u062f\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0647\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u062d \u0644\u0643\u0644 \u0623\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0646\u0642\u062f\u0627 \u0639\u0646\u064a\u0641\u0627.\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0628\u064a \u062e\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u062b\u0627\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u062d\u0631 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u060c \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642 \u0644\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0639\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645 \u0641\u0631\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0643 \u0634\u064a\u0644\u0644\u0631\u060c \u0625\u0630 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u062d\u062f\u0649 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642 \u064a\u0634\u0643\u0648 \u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0636\u0628 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u062d\u062a\u0647 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0639: \\"\u0623\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0634\u0643\u0648\u0627\u0643 \u064a\u0631\u062c\u0639 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0628\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0639\u0642\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0643\u060c \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0644 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u063a\u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u0643\u062b\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0631\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0643\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0641 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0632\u0627\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u060c \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0643\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0646\u0641\u0639 \u0628\u0644 \u0644\u0639\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0642\u0644 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0639!

Who, in the face of all his experience of life and of history, will have the courage to dispute this assertion?","No one who shares a delusion ever recognizes it as such.","I am actually not at all a man of science, not an observer, not an experimenter, not a thinker.

We find with astonishment that progress has concluded an alliance with barbarism.","The dream has no way at all of expressing the alternative \u2018either \u2026 or\u2019. It usually takes up the two options into one context as if they had equal rights.","Dreams tell us many an unpleasant biological truth about ourselves and only very free minds can thrive on such a diet.

Since wishing it to be the case that two people have something in common is often the same as exchanging them, this relation too is expressed in the dream by identification. In the dream of Irma\'s injection, I wish to exchange this patient for another, that is, I wish that the other were my patient, as Irma is; the dream takes account of the wish in showing me a figure who is called Irma, but who is examined in a posture in which I have only had occasion to see the other.",".It is asking a great deal of a man, who has learnt to regulate his everyday affairs in accordance with the rules of experience and with due regard to reality, that he should entrust precisely what affects him most nearly to the care of an authority which claims as its prerogative freedom from all the rules of rational thought.","what we know to be useless, but expect civilization to value, is beauty;","The dream is the (disguised) fulfillment of a (suppressed, repressed) wish.","El primer humano que insult\xf3 a su enemigo en vez de tirarle una piedra fue el fundador de la civilizaci\xf3n","McDougall does not dispute the thesis as tothe collective inhibition of intelligence in groups(p. 41). He says that the minds of lower intelligencebring down those of a higher order to their ownlevel. The latter are obstructed in their activity,because in general an intensification of emotioncreates unfavourable conditions for sound intellectualwork, and further because the individuals are intimidatedby the group and their mental activity isnot free, and because there is a lowering in eachindividual of his sense of responsibility for his ownperformances.","The hypermnesia of dreams and their command of childhood material have become the two pillars on which our theory rests; our theory of dreams has ascribed to wishes deriving from childhood the part of indispensable moving-force in the formation of dreams.","All that is to live in endless song Must in life-time first be drown\'d.","Since McDougall contrasts the behaviour of ahighly organised group with what has just been described,we shall be particularly interested to learnin what this organisation consists, and by whatfactors it is produced. The author enumerates fiveprincipal conditions \'for raising collective mentallife to a higher level.The first and fundamental condition is that thereshould be some degree of continuity of existence inthe group. This may be either material or formal:the former, if the same individuals persist in thegroup for some time; and the latter, if there isdeveloped within the group a system of fixed positionswhich are occupied by a succession of individuals.The second condition is that in the individualmember of the group some definite idea should beformed of the nature, composition, functions andcapacities of the group, so that from this he maydevelop an emotional relation to the group as awhole.The third is that the group should be broughtinto interaction (perhaps in the form of rivalry) withother groups similar to it but differing from it inmany respects.The fourth is that the group should possesstraditions, customs and habits, and especially such asdetermine the relations of its members to oneanother.The fifth is that the group should have a definitestructure, expressed in the specialisation and differentiationof the functions of its constituents.According to McDougall, if these conditionsare fulfilled, the psychological disadvantages of thegroup formation are removed. The collective loweringof intellectual ability is avoided by withdrawingthe performance of intellectual tasks from the groupand reserving them for individual members of it.","In such a case a person would hear of something new which, on the ground of certain evidence, he is asked to accept as true; yet it contradicts many of his wishes and offends some of his highly treasured convictions. He will then hesitate, look for arguments to cast doubt on the new material, and so will struggle for a while until at last he admits it himself: \\" all this is true after all, although I find it hard to accept and it is painful to have to believe in it.\\" All we learn from this process is that it needs time for the intellectual work of the Ego to overcome objections that are invested by strong feelings.","The individual citizen can prove with dismay in this war what occasionally thrust itself upon him already in times of peace, namely, that the state forbids him to do wrong not because it wishes to do away with wrongdoing but because it wishes to monopolize it, like salt and tobacco.","The weakling and the neurotic attached to his neurosis are not anxious to turn such a powerful searchlight upon the dark corners of their psychology.","but the state of sleep, we found, is not characterized by the disintegration of psychical interconnections, but by the focus on the wish to sleep by the psychical system in control of the day.","Cilv\u0113ku lielais vairums str\u0101d\u0101 tikai nepiecie\u0161am\u012bbas spiesti, un no \u0161\u012b cilv\u0113ka dabisk\u0101 riebuma pret darbu izriet pa\u0161as smag\u0101k\u0101s soci\u0101l\u0101s probl\u0113mas.","We are alone in confronting a different state of affairs; as we see it, there is a new kind of psychical material intervening between the content of the dream and the results of our reflections: the latent dream-content reached by our procedure, or the dream-thoughts. It is from this latent content, not the manifest, that we worked out the solution to the dream.","This is why a new task faces us which did not exist before, the task of investigating the relationship of the manifest dream-content to the latent dream-thoughts, and of tracing the processes by which the latter turned into the former.","The dream-thoughts and the dream-content lie before us like two versions of the same content in two different languages, or rather, the dream-content looks to us like a translation of the dream-thoughts into another mode of expression, and we are supposed to get to know its signs and laws of grammatical construction by comparing the original and the translation.","\u0130fade edilmemi\u015f duygular asla \xf6lmez, sadece diri diri g\xf6m\xfcl\xfcr ve sonradan daha korkun\xe7 \u015fekillerde tezah\xfcr ederler.","Dream disfigurement, then, turns out in reality to be an act of the censor.","Individual liberty is not an asset of civilization. It was greatest before there was any civilization, though admittedly even then it was largely worthless, because the individual was hardly in a position to defend it. With the development of civilization it underwent restrictions, and justice requires that no one shall be spared these restrictions. Whatever makes itself felt in a human community as an urge for freedom may amount to a revolt against an existing injustice, thus favouring a further advance of civilization and remaining compatible with it. But it may spring from what remains of the original personality, still untamed by civilization, and so become a basis for hostility to civilization. The urge for freedom is thus directed against particular forms and claims of civilization, or against civilization as a whole. It does not seem as though any influence can induce human beings to change their nature and become like termites; they will probably always defend their claim to individual freedom against the will of the mass.","The same diversity in their ways of formation and the same rules for its solution hold good also for the innumerable medley of dream contents, examples of which I need scarcely adduce. Their strangeness quite disappears when we resolve not to place them on a level with the objects of perception as known to us when awake, but to remember that they represent the art of dream condensation by an exclusion of unnecessary detail.","The communal life of human beings had, therefore, a two-fold foundation: the compulsion to work, which was created by external necessity, and the power of love.","Everyone of us who can look back over a longer or shorter life experience will probably say that he might have spared himself many disappointments and painful surprises if he had found the courage and decision to interpret as omens the little mistakes which he made in his intercourse with people, and to consider them as indications of the intentions which were still being kept secret. As","I always find the same principles confirmed: the elements formed into the dream are drawn from the entire mass of the dream-thoughts, and in its relation to the dream-thoughts each one of the elements seems to be determined many times over.","Dream-displacement and dream-condensation are the two foremen in charge of the dream-work, and we may put the shaping of our dreams down mainly to their activity.","If man must himself die, after first losing his most beloved ones by death, he would prefer that his life be forfeit to an inexorable law of nature, the sublime \u2020\xc5\xac\xb3\xc7\xb7, than to a mere accident which perhaps could have been in some way avoided. But perhaps this belief in the incidence of death as the necessary consequence of an inner law of being is also only one of those illusions that we have fashioned for ourselves \'so as to endure the burden of existence\'. It is certainly not a primordial belief: the idea of a \'natural death\' is alien to primitive races; they ascribe every death occurring among themselves to the influence of an enemy or an evil spirit. So let","One must be humble, one must keep personal preferences and antipathies in the background, if one wishes to discover the realities of the world.","thanks to the discrepancies between people\u2019s thoughts and their actions, and to the diversity of their wishful impulses.","The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions.","The communists think they have found the way to redeem mankind from evil. Man is equivocally good and well disposed to his neighbour, but his nature has been corrupted by the institution of private property ... I can recognize the psychological presumption behind it as a baseless illusion.

Aggression was not created by property.","I was convinced, I added, that she would be better at once if her father said that he was sacrificing Frau K. to her health. I hoped that he would not be persuaded to do so, because then she would have seen what a strong weapon she had in her hands, and would certainly not shrink from exploiting all the possibilities of illness on every future occasion.

G. Jung. Aceste miscari pareau foarte periculoase si castigasera repede un mare numar de partizani. Ele nu trebuiau, totusi, prin forta lor, sa fie resimtite ca niste socuri furnizate psihanalizei, chiar daca nu se mai nega materialul faptic, ci permiteau, ceea ce era ademenitor, eliberarea de rezultate. Jung a incercat o transpunere a faptelor analitice intr-un mod abstract, impersonal, fara sa tina cont de istoria individului, modalitate prin care el spera sa indeparteze recunoasterea sexualitatii infantile si a complexului lui Oedip, ca si necesitatea de a analiza copilaria. Adler parea sa se indeparteze si mai mult de psihanaliza, respingand total importanta sexualitatii. Critica a fost ingaduitoare cu cele doua miscari (pentru cei doi \xaberetici\xbb), eu neputand sa obtin mai mult decat sa-i fac pe Adler si pe Jung sa renunte sa-si numeasca doctrinele \xabpsihanaliza\xbb. Se poate astazi constata, la capatul a zece ani, ca cele doua tentative au trecut pe langa psihanaliza fara sa o atinga.Este suficient sa spun ca in fata celor care m-au parasit ca Jung, Adler, Stekel sau alti cativa, se gaseste un mare numar de cercetatori ca Abraham, Eitingon, Ferenczi, Rank, Jones, Brill, Sachs, pastorul Pfister, van Emden, Reik, care de aproape 15 ani mi-au ramas fideli colaboratori, de majoritatea legandu-ma o prietenie pe care nimic n-a tulburat-o. N-am numit aici decat pe cei mai vechi dintre elevii mei, cei care si-au facut deja un nume in literatura psihanalitica; amintirea altor nume nu implica mai putin respect, si tocmai printre cei tineri si printre cei care au venit la mine mai tarziu se gasesc talente care ne dau mari sperante. Dar trebuie sa spun in avantajul meu ca un om dominat de intoleranta si de aroganta perfectiunii nu s-ar fi putut inconjura de o astfel de legiune de personalitati cu o inteligenta superioara, mai ales cand nu are sa le ofere atractii de ordin practic.","The substitute gratifications, such as art offers, are illusions in contrast to reality, but none the less satisfying to the mind on that account, thanks to the place which phantasy has reserved for herself in mental life.","...our philosophy has preserved essential traits of animistic modes of thought such as the over-estimation of the magic of words and the belief that real processes in the external world follow the lines laid down by our thoughts.","Expressando-o de modo sucinto, existem duas caracter\xedsticas humanas muito difundidas, respons\xe1veis pelo fato de os regulamentos da civiliza\xe7\xe3o s\xf3 poderem ser mantidos atrav\xe9s de certo grau de coer\xe7\xe3o, a saber, que os homens n\xe3o s\xe3o espontaneamente amantes do trabalho e que os argumentos n\xe3o t\xeam valia alguma contra suas paix\xf5es.","Another assumption is labelled \u2018regression\u2019, and here the reader encounters strange diagrams purporting to represent the direction of psychical energy within the mind.","Anyone who sets about hypnotizing half sceptically, who may perhaps seem comical to himself in this situation, and who reveals by his expression, his voice and his bearing that he expects nothing from the experiment, will have no reason to be surprised at his failures, and should rather leave this method of treatment to other physicians who are able to practise it without feeling damaged in their medical dignity, since they have convinced themselves, by experience and reading, of the reality and importance of hypnotic influence","The delusions of paranoiacs have an unpalatable external similarity and internal kinship to the systems of our philosophers.","Perci\xf2 la differenza tra me ed un uomo superstizioso consiste in questo: io non credo che un avvenimento verificatosi senza alcuna partecipazione della mia vita psichica possa rivelarmi cose arcane sul futuro; credo invece che un\'espressione non intenzionale della mia vita psichica possa rivelarmi qualcosa di ignoto che, in fondo, appartiene solo alla mia vita psichica; credo alla casualit\xe0 esterna (reale) ma non a quella interna (psichica). Insomma, il mio \xe8 l\'atteggiamento esattamente opposto a quello del superstizioso; egli, non sapendo nulla della motivazione degli atti casuali e degli atti mancati, crede nella casualit\xe0 psichica; \xe8 portato ad attribuire al caso esterno un\'importanza che si manifesta nella realt\xe0 futura, ed a vedere nel caso un mezzo d\'espressione di qualcosa che \xe8 nascosto nella realt\xe0. Ci sono dunque due differenze tra me e l\'uomo superstizioso: prima di tutto egli proietta all\'esterno una motivazione che io cerco all\'interno; in secondo luogo, egli interpreta il caso per mezzo di un avvenimento che io riconduco ad un\'idea. Ci\xf2 che per lui \xe8 occulto per me \xe8 inconscio; in noi c\'\xe8 la tendenza comune a non considerare il caso come tale, ma ad interpretarlo.Ora io sostengo che quest\'ignoranza cosciente e questa conoscenza inconscia della motivazione delle casualit\xe0 psichiche sono una delle radici della superstizione.

A prejudice is widespread among the public (actually supported by some eminent, but in this matter inexperienced, physicians) that hypnosis is a dangerous operation. If we sought to impose hypnosis on someone who believed this assertion, we should probably be interrupted, after no more than a few minutes, by disagreeable occurrences, which would arise from the patient\'s anxiety and his distressing feeling of garded as results of hypnosis.","When it comes to the small matters in life one should think long and hard, but when it comes to the big ones -whether or not to marry, whether to have children- one should just go ahead and do it","It is precisely the minor differences in people who are otherwise alike that form the basis of feelings of strangeness and hostility between them.","The waking life never repeats itself with its trials and joys, its pleasures and pains, but, on the contrary, the dream aims to relieve us of these. Even when our whole mind is filled with one subject, when profound sorrow has torn our hearts or when a task has claimed the whole power of our mentality, the dream either gives us something entirely strange, or it takes for its combinations only a few elements from reality, or it only enters into the strain of our mood and symbolises reality.","Cand se cerceteaza gandurile aflate prin analiza visului, se descopera unul care se detaseaza net de altele, inteligibile si bine cunoscute de cel care doarme. Aceste alte ganduri sunt ramasite ale vietii treze (ramasite diurne); in gandul izolat se recunoaste o dorinta adesea foarte socanta, straina starii de trezire a celui care viseaza, si pe care el o intampina, prin urmare, prin tagaduiri uimite su indignate. Aceasta dorinta este elementul propriu-zis care formeaza visul, furnizeaza energia necesara producerii visului si se serveste de ramasitele diurne ca de un simplu materia; visul, astfel constituit, reprezinta o situatie in care aceasta dorinta este satisfacuta; visul este realizarea acestei dorinte.","Visul este realizarea mascata a unei dorinte refulate. Este construit ca un simptom nevrotic, este o formatie de compromis intre necesitatea unei aspiratii instinctive refulate si rezistenta unei puteri cenzurate in eu. In virtutea unei origini asemanatoare el este la fel de incomprehensibil ca si simptomul si necesita, ca si acesta, o interpretare.","Of course it would not occur to us to doubt the importance, experimentally demonstrated, of external sensory stimuli during sleep, but we have given this material the same place relative to the dream-wish as we have the remnants of thought left over from the work of the day. We do not need to dispute that the dream interprets the objective sensory stimulus as if it were an illusion; but where the authorities left the motive for this interpretation uncertain, we have put it in.","This time once again it has been my chief aim to make no sacrifice to an appearance of being simple, complete or rounded off, not to disguise problems and not to deny the existence of gaps and uncertainties. In no other scientific field would it be necessary to boast of such modest intentions. They are universally regarded as self-evident; the public expects nothing else. No reader of an account of astronomy will feel disappointed and contemptuous of the science if he is shown the frontiers at which our knowledge of the universe melts into haziness. Only in psychology is it otherwise. There mankind\'s constitutional unfitness for scientific research comes fully into the open. What people seem to demand of psychology is not progress in knowledge, but satisfactions of some other sort; every unsolved problem, every admitted uncertainty is made into a reproach against it.Whoever cares for the science of mental life must accept these injustices along with it.","Ko postavlja pitanje o smislu zivota,s njegovim libidom nije nesto u redu.","Analytic experience has taught us that the better is always the enemy of the good and that in every phase of the patient\'s recovery we have to fight against his inertia, which is ready to be content with an incomplete solution.","The normal sequence is that energy is prompted at the perceptual system, passes into consciousness, and thence to the motor system, where it is discharged by action. (I feel an unpleasant sensation, realize that I have been bitten by a mosquito, raise my hand, and swat the insect.) But in dreaming energy flows the other way. Barred by the censor from consciousness, and hence from discharge through action, wishes flow back, collecting unconscious memories on their way, and present themselves once again, now transformed by the dream-work, to the sleeper\u2019s lowered consciousness.","[Reli\u0123ija]. \u0160o providenci vienk\u0101r\u0161ais cilv\u0113ks nevar iedom\u0101ties cit\u0101di k\u0101 vien \u0101rk\u0101rt\u012bgi k\u0101pin\u0101t\u0101 t\u0113va person\u0101.

In the individual only the aggression of the super-ego makes itself clearly heard, when tension arises, in the form of reproaches, while the demands themselves often remain unconscious in the background. When brought fully into consciousness, they are seen to coincide with the precepts of the current cultural super-ego. At this point there seems to be a regular cohesion, as it were, between the cultural development of the mass and the personal development of the individual. Some manifestations and properties of the super-ego can thus be recognized more easily by its behaviour in the cultural community than by its behaviour in the individual.","Positive transference is then further divisible into transference of friendly or affectionate feelings which are admissible to consciousness and transference of prolongation of those feelings into the consciousness and transference of prolongations of those feelings into the unconscious. As regards the latter, analysis shows that they invariably go back to erotic sources. And we are thus led to the discovery that all the emotional relations of sympathy, friendship, trust, and the like, which can be turned to good account in our lives, are genetically linked with sexuality and have developed from purely sexual desires through a softening of their sexual aim, however pure and unsensual they may appear to our conscious self-perception. Originally we knew only sexual objects; and psychoanalysis shows us that people who in our real life are merely admired or respected may still be sexual objects for our unconscious","We are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from a state of things.","Individual liberty is not an asset of civilization.","Words call forth effects and are the universal means of influencing human beings.","It haslong been our contention that \' dread of society [sozialeAngsty is the essence of what is called conscience.","It haslong been our contention that \' dread of society [sozialeAngst] is the essence of what is called conscience.","Historical writing, which had begun to keep a continuous record of the present, now also cast a glance back to the past, gathered traditions and legends, interpreted the traces of antiquity that survived in customs and usages, and in this way created a history of the past. It was inevitable that this early history should have been an expression of present beliefs and wishes rather than a true picture of the past; for many things had been dropped from the nation\'s memory, while others were distorted, and some remains of the past were given a wrong interpretation in order to fit in with contemporary ideas. Moreover people\'s motive for writing history was not objective curiosity but a desire to influence their contemporaries, to encourage and inspire them, or to hold a mirror up before them. A man\'s conscious memory of the events of his maturity is in every way comparable to the first kind of historical writing [which was a chronicle of current events]; while the memories that he has of his childhood correspond, as far as their origins and reliability are concerned, to the history of a nation\'s earliest days, which was compiled later and for tendentious reasons.","Various sources force us to assume that the so-called earliest childhood recollections are not true memory traces but later elaborations of the same, elaborations which might have been subjected to the influences of many later psychic forces.

We really ought to wonder why the memory of later years has, as a rule, retained so little of these psychic processes, especially as we have every reason for assuming that these same forgotten childhood activities have not glided off without leaving a trace in the development of the person, but that they have left a definite influence for all future time.","If we subject the content of the dream to analysis, we become aware that the dream fear is no more justified by the dream content than the fear in a phobia is justified by the idea upon which the phobia depends.","We are saying much the same thing when we derive the antithesis between civilization and sexuality from the circumstance that sexual love is a relationship between two individuals in which a third can only be superfluous or disturbing, whereas civilization depends on relationships between a considerable number of individuals.","The first thing the investigator comes to understand in comparing the dream-content with the dream-thoughts is that work of condensation has been carried out here on a grand scale.","In his description of the melancholic,\xa0Freud says that such patients are particularly perceptive with respect to their self-image:When in his heightened self-criticism he describes himself as petty,\xa0egoistic, dishonest, lacking in independence, one whose sole aim\xa0has been to hide the weaknesses of\xa0his own nature,\xa0it may be, so far as we know, that he has come pretty near to understanding himself: we only wonder why a man has to be ill before he can be accessible to a truth of this kind.","Couldn\'t I for once have you and the work at the same time?","The profound obscurity of the background of our ignorance is scarcely illuminated by a few glimmers of insight.","Parfois un cigar est seulement un cigar comme dit Freud, mais aussi Clinton !","But since Freud still conceives the mind as a closed system, desires are not expelled but only hidden away.","The question of the purpose of human life has been raised countless times; it has never yet received a satisfactory answer and perhaps does not admit of one. Some of those who have asked it have added that if it should turn out that life has no purpose, it would lose all value for them. But this threat alters nothing. It looks, on the contrary, as though one had a right to dismiss the question, for it seems to derive from the human presumptuousness, many other manifestations of which are already familiar to us. Nobody talks about the purpose of the life of animals, unless, perhaps, it may be supposed to lie in being of service to man. But this view is not tenable either, for there are many animals of which man can make nothing, except to describe, classify and study them; and innumerable species of animals have escaped even this use, since they existed and became extinct before man set eyes on them.","O homem n\xe3o tem nada melhor para fazer do que tentar estar em perfeito acordo consigo mesmo.","his understanding of transference in the therapeutic relationship and the presumed value of dreams as sources of insight into unconscious desires.

In antichitatea clasica, visurile erau considerate adesea previziuni ale viitorului; stiinta moderna nu voia sa auda de visuri, le lega de domeniul superstitiei, declarandu-le un simplu act \xabcorporal\xbb, un soi de tresarire a vietii psihice, de altfel adormite.

Dar din moment ce nu era luata in seama dispretuirea visului si era tratat ca un simptom nevrotic neinteles, ca o idee deliranta sau obsesiva care, indepartandu-se de continutul sau aparent, lua ca obiect al asocierii libere imaginile sale izolate, atunci se ajungea la un cu totul alt rezultat. Se ajungea prin urmatoarele asocieri ale celui care visa, la constientizarea unor ansambluri de ganduri care nu mai puteau fi numite absurde sau confuze, care corespuneau unui act psihic de mare valoare si ale carui vis manifest nu era decat o traducere deformata, trunchiata sau rau inteleasa, cel mai adesea o traducere in imagini vizuale. Aceste ganduri latente ale visului contineau sensul visului, continutul manifest al visului nefiind decat o iluzie, o fatada de unde putea pleca asocierea cu adevarul dar nu si interpretarea.","we shall not fall out of this world.

It is always possible to bind quite large numbers of people together in love, provided that others are left out as targets for aggression.","May we not be justified in reaching the diagnosis that, under the influence of cultural urges, some civilizations, or some epochs of civilization\u2014possibly the whole of mankind\u2014have become \'neurotic\'?","The voice of the intellect is a soft one, but it does not rest till it has gained a hearing. Finally, after a countless succession of rebuffs, it succeeds.","Human megalomania will have suffered its third and most wounding blow from the psychological research of the present time which seeks to prove to the ego that it is not even master in its own house, but must content itself with scanty information of what is going on unconsciously in its mind.","Religion ... imposes equally on everyone its own path to the acquisition of happiness and protection from suffering. Its technique consists in depressing the value of life and distorting the picture of the real world in a delusional manner \u2013 which presupposes an intimidation of the intelligence.

As honest smallholders on this earth they will know how to cultivate their plot in such a way that it supports them. By withdrawing their expectations from the other world and concentrating all their liberated energies into their life on earth, they will probably succeed in achieving a state of things in which life will become tolerable for everyone and civilization no longer oppressive to anyone.

When a wife loses her husband, or a daughter her mother, it not infrequently happens that the survivor is afflicted with tormenting scruples, called \u2018obsessive reproaches\u2019 which raises the question whether she herself has not been guilty through carelessness or neglect, of the death of the beloved person. No recalling of the care with which she nursed the invalid, or direct refutation of the asserted guilt can put an end to the torture, which is the pathological expression of mourning and which in time slowly subsides. Psychoanalytic investigation of such cases has made us acquainted with the secret mainsprings of this affliction. We have ascertained that these obsessive reproaches are in a certain sense justified and therefore are immune to refutation or objections. Not that the mourner has really been guilty of the death or that she has really been careless, as the obsessive reproach asserts; but still there was something in her, a wish of which she herself was unaware, which was not displeased with the fact that death came, and which would have brought it about sooner had it been strong enough. The reproach now reacts against this unconscious wish after the death of the beloved person. Such hostility, hidden in the unconscious behind tender love, exists in almost all cases of intensive emotional allegiance to a particular person, indeed it represents the classic case, the prototype of the ambivalence of human emotions. There is always more or less of this ambivalence in everybody\u2019s disposition; normally it is not strong enough to give rise to the obsessive reproaches we have described. But where there is abundant predisposition for it, it manifests itself in the relation to those we love most, precisely where you would least expect it. The disposition to compulsion neurosis which we have so often taken for comparison with taboo problems, is distinguished by a particularly high degree of this original ambivalence of emotions.","We know that the first step towards attaining intellectual mastery of our environment is to discover generalizations, rules and laws which bring order into chaos.

It is only in the highest and most sacred things that he allows himself to do so.","the process of dreaming transfers psychical intensity from what is important, but also objectionable, onto what is insignificant.","The normal sequence is that energy is prompted at the perceptual system, passes into consciousness, and thence to the motor system, where it is discharged by action. (I feel an unpleasant sensation, realize that I have been bitten by a mosquito, raise my hand, and swat the insect.)","character-traits of orderliness, parsimony and obstinacy, which are so often prominent in people who were formerlyanal erotics, are to be regarded as the first and most constant results ofthe sublimation of anal eroticism","...we cannot fail to recognise the influence which the progressive control over natural forces exerts on the social relationships between men, since men always place their newly won powers at the service of their aggressiveness, and use them against one another.","One can make a compound formation of events and of places in the same way as of people, provided always that the single events and localities have something in common which the latent dream emphasizes. It is a sort of new and fleeting concept of formation, with the common element as its kernel. This jumble of details that has been fused together regularly results in a vague indistinct picture, as though you had taken several pictures on the same film.","If we thus recognisethat the aim is to equip the group with theattributes of the individual, we shall be remindedof a valuable remark of Trotter\'s, to the effect thatthe tendency towards the formation of groups is biologicallya continuation of the multicellular characterof all the higher organisms.","We may say that the patient does not remember anything at all of what he has forgotten and repressed, but rather acts it out. He reproduces it not as a memory, but as an action; he repeats it, without of course being aware of the fact that he is repeating it.","It would be futile to delude ourselves that at present, readers find every pathography unsavory. This attitude is excused with the reproach that from a pathographic elaboration of a great man one never obtains an understanding of his importance and his attainments, that it is therefore useless mischief to study in him things which could just as well be found in the first comer. However, this criticism is so clearly unjust that it can only be grasped when viewed as a pretext and a disguise for something. As a matter of fact pathography does not aim at making comprehensible the attainments of the great man; no one should really be blamed for not doing something which one never promised. The real motives for the opposition are quite different. One finds them when one bears in mind that biographers are fixed on their heroes in quite a peculiar manner. Frequently they take the hero as the object of study because, for reasons of their personal emotional life, they bear him a special affection from the very outset. They then devote themselves to a work of idealization which strives to enroll the great men among their infantile models, and to revive through him, as it were, the infantile conception of the father. For the sake of this wish they wipe out the individual features in his physiognomy, they rub out the traces of his life\'s struggle with inner and outer resistances, and do not tolerate in him anything of human weakness or imperfection; they then give us a cold, strange, ideal form instead of the man to whom we could feel distantly related. It is to be regretted that they do this, for they thereby sacrifice the truth to an illusion, and for the sake of their infantile phantasies they let slip the opportunity to penetrate into the most attractive secrets of human nature.","The greater the resistance, the more thoroughly remembering will be replaced by acting out (repetition)....he repeats everything deriving from the repressed element within himself that has already established itself in his manifest personality.","Our first answer must be that the dream has no means at its disposal among the dream-thoughts of representing these logical relations. Mostly it disregards all these terms and takes over only the factual substance of the dream-thoughts to work upon. It is left to the interpretation of the dream to re-establish the connections which the dream-work has destroyed. This inability to express such relations must be due to the nature of the psychical material which goes to make the dream. After all, the fine arts, painting and sculpture, are subject to a similar limitation in comparison with literature, which can make use of speech. Here too the cause of the incapacity lies in the material which both arts use as their medium of expression.","Mathematics enjoys the greatest reputation as a diversion from sexuality. This had been the very advice to which Jean-Jacques Rousseau was obliged to listen from a lady who was dissatisfied with him: \'Lascia le donne e studia la matematica!\' So too our fugitive threw himself with special eagerness into the mathematics and geometry which he was taught at school, till suddenly one day his powers of comprehension were paralysed in the face of some apparently innocent problems. It was possible to establish two of these problems; \'Two bodies come together, one with a speed of ... etc\' and \'On a cylinder, the diameter of whose surface is m, describe a cone ... etc\' Other people would certainly not have regarded these as very striking allusions to sexual events; but he felt that he had been betrayed by mathematics as well, and took flight from it too.","Woe to you, my Princess, when I come... you shall see who is the stronger, a gentle girl who doesn\'t eat enough or a big wild man who has cocaine in his body.","no one who still shares a delusion will ever recognize it as such.","And I will go on kissing you till you are strong and gay and happy \u2014 and if they haven\'t died, they are still alive today.","In this scheme, the \u2018unconscious\u2019 and the \u2018preconscious\u2019 are agencies or authorities (Instanzen) which the wish has to satisfy; the unconscious is more tolerant, and helps the wish to smuggle itself past the censorship of the preconscious. As a result, psychical energy is discharged without disturbing sleep.","Eros and Ananke [Love and Necessity] have become the parents of human civilization.","The patients cannot themselves bring all their conflicts into the transference; nor is the analyst able to call out all their possible instinctual conflicts from the transference situation.","There are innumerable civilized people who would shrink from murder or incest, and who yet do not hesitate to gratify their avarice, their aggressiveness and their sexual lusts, and who have no compunction in hurting others by lying, fraud and calumny, so long as they remain unpunished for it; and no doubt this has been so for many cultural epochs. \xa0\xa0\xa0If","Primitive man was as incapable of imagining and realizing his own death as any one of us are today. But a case arose in which the two opposite attitudes towards death clashed and came into conflict with each other, with results that are both significant and far reaching. Such a case was given when primitive man saw one of his own relatives die, his wife, child, or friend, whom he certainly loved as we do ours; for love cannot be much younger than the lust for murder. In his pain he must have discovered that he, too, could die, an admission against which his whole being must have revolted, for everyone of these loved ones was a part of his own beloved self. On the other hand again, every such death was satisfactory to him, for there was also something foreign in each one of these persons. The law of emotional ambivalence, which today still governs our emotional relations to those whom we love, certainly obtained far more widely in primitive times. The beloved dead had nevertheless roused some hostile feelings in primitive man just because they had been both friends and enemies.","It was not the intellectual puzzle or any particular death which roused the spirit of inquiry in man, but the conflict of emotions at the death of beloved and withal foreign and hated persons.From this emotional conflict psychology arose. Man could no longer keep death away from him, for he had tasted of it in his grief for the deceased, but he did not want to acknowledge it, since he could not imagine himself dead. He therefore formed a compromise and concealed his own death but denied it the significance of destroying life, a distinction for which the death of his enemies had given him no motive. He invented spirits during his contemplation of the corpse of the person he loved, and his consciousness of guilt over the gratification which mingled with his grief brought it about that these first created spirits were transformed into evil demons who were to be feared. The changes wrought by death suggested to him to divide the individual into body and soul, at first several souls, and in this way his train of thought paralleled the disintegration process inaugurated by death. The continued remembrance of the dead became the basis of the assumption of other forms of existence and gave him the idea of a future life after apparent death.","Words were originally magic, and the word retains much of its old magical power even to-day. With words one man can make another blessed, or drive him to despair; by words the teacher transfers his knowledge to the pupil; by words the speaker sweeps his audience with him and determines its judgments and decisions. Words call forth effects and are the universal means of influencing human beings. Therefore let us not underestimate the use of words in psychotherapy, and let us be satisfied if we may be auditors of the words which are exchanged between the analyst and his patient.","To love one\u2019s neighbour as oneself \u2014 a commandment which is really justified by the fact that nothing else runs as strongly counter to the original nature of man.","It is asserted, however, that each one of us behaves in some one respect like a paranoic, corrects some aspect of the world which is unbearable to him by the construction of a wish and introduces this delusion into reality. A special importance attaches to the case in which this attempt to procure a certainty of happiness and a protection against suffering through a delusional remoulding of reality is made by a considerable number of people in common. The religions of mankind must be classed among p. 31 the mass-delusions of this kind.","Hence, it is quite conceivable that even the sense of guilt engendered by civilization is not recognized as such, but remains for the most part unconscious, or manifests itself as an unease, a discontent, for which other motivations are sought. The religions, at least, have never ignored the part that a sense of guilt plays in civilization. Moreover - a point I failed to appreciate earlier - they claim to redeem humanity from this sense of guilt, which they call sin. From the way in which this redemption is achieved in Christianity - through the sacrificial death of one man, who thereby takes upon himself the guilt shared by all - we drew an inference as to what may have been the original occasion for our acquiring this primordial guilt, which also marked the beginning of civilization.","It is impossible to escape the impression that people commonly use false standards of measurement - that they seek power, success and wealth for themselves and admire them in others, and that they underestimate what is of true value in life. And yet, in making any general judgement of this sort, we are in danger of forgetting how variegated the human world and its mental life are.","Nonostante tutte le approssimazioni e anticipazioni nel mondo circostante, fu nello spirito di un uomo ebreo, Saulo di Tarso, che per la prima volta si affacci\xf2 l\'idea: \xabSiamo cos\xec infelici perch\xe9 abbiamo ucciso Dio Padre\xbb.","Religion interferes with this play of selection and adaptation by forcing on everyone indiscriminately its own path to the attainment of happiness and protection from suffering. Its technique consists in reducing the value of life and distorting the picture of the real world by means of delusion; and this presupposes the intimidation of the intelligence.","Alongside of the physical symptoms of hysteria, a number of psychical disturbances are to be observed, in which at some future time the changes characteristic of hysteria will no doubt be found but the analysis of which has hitherto scarcely been begun. These are changes in the passage and in the association of ideas, inhibitions of the activity of the will, magnification and suppression of feelings, etc. -- which may be summarized as \\"changes in the normal distribution over the nervous system of the stable amounts of excitation\\".","The superego is, however, not simply a residue of the earliest object-choices of the id; it also represents an energetic reaction-formation against those choices.","We avoid the familiar reproach that we base our constructions of mental life on pathological findings; for dreams are regular events in the life of a normal person, however much their characteristics may differ from the productions of our waking life.","We shall tell ourselves that it would be very nice if there were a God who created the world and was a benevolent Providence, and if there were a moral order in the universe and an after-life; but it is a very striking fact that all this is exactly as we are bound to wish it to be.","Yet we see, on the contrary, that many acts are most successfully carried out when they are not the objects of particularly concentrated attention, and that the mistakes occur just at the point where one is most anxious to be accurate\u2014where a distraction of the necessary attention is therefore surely least permissible. One could then say that this is the effect of the \\"excitement,\\" but we do not understand why the excitement does not intensify the concentration of attention on the goal that is so much desired.","But the dream-work knows how to select a condition that will turn even this dreaded event into a wish-fulfilment: the dreamer sees himself in an ancient Etruscan grave, into which he has descended, happy in the satisfaction it has given to his archaeological interests. Similarly man makes the forces of nature not simply in the image of men with whom he can associate as his equals\u2014that would not do justice to the overpowering impression they make on him\u2014but he gives them the characteristics of the father, makes them into gods, thereby following not only an infantile, but also, as I have tried to show, a phylogenetic prototype. \xa0\xa0\xa0In","In tal modo era taciuta l\'uccisione di Dio, ma un crimine la cui espiazione richiedeva che una vittima fosse immolata non poteva esser stato che un omicidio.","We are naturally grieved over the fact that a just God and a kindly providence do not guard us better against such influences in our most defenseless age. We thereby gladly forget that as a matter of fact everything in our life is accident from our very origin through the meeting of spermatozoa and ovum, accident, which nevertheless participates in the lawfulness and fatalities of nature, and lacks only the connection to our wishes and illusions.","We all still show too little respect for nature, which in Leonardo\'s deep words recalling Hamlet\'s speech \\"is full of infinite reasons which never appeared in experience.\\" Every one of us human beings corresponds to one of the infinite experiments in which these \\"reasons of nature\\" force themselves into experience.","The reaction to these claims of impulse and these threats of danger, a reaction in which the real activity of the psychic apparatus is manifested, may be guided correctly by the pleasure-principle or by the reality-principle which modifies this.","a materialization of our conscience, of the severe super-ego within us, in which the punitive agency of our childhood finds residual expression.","Under the influence of the instinct of the ego for self-preservation it is replaced by the \'reality-principle \', which without giving up the intention of ultimately attaining pleasure yet demands and enforces the postponement of satisfaction, the renunciation of manifold possibilities of it, and the temporary endurance of \'pain\' on the long and circuitous road to pleasure. The pleasure-principle however remains for a long time the method of operation of the sex impulses, which are not so easily educable, and it happens over and over again that whether acting through these impulses or operating in the ego itself it prevails over the reality-principle to the detriment of the whole organism.","Everywhere I go deep, I find a poet there before me.","In this situation, what we call natural ethics has nothing to offer but the narcissistic satisfaction of being able to think one is better than others. This is where ethics based on religion enters the scene with its promises of a better life hereafter. I am inclined to think that, for as long as virtue goes unrewarded here below, ethics will preach in vain.","In the traumatic neuroses there are two outstanding features which might serve as clues for further reflection: first that the chief causal factor seemed to lie in the element of surprise, in the fright; and secondly that an injury or wound sustained at the same time generally tended to prevent the occurrence of the neurosis.","repression\u2014which\xa0we\xa0must carefully note is not a suspension. The excitations in question are produced as usual but are prevented from attaining their aim by psychic hindrances, and are driven off into many other paths until they express themselves in a symptom.","Not that I know so much, but there are so many equally valid possibilities. For the present I do not believe that anyone is justified in saying that sexuality is the mother of all feelings.","Quite unlike conscious memories from the time of maturity, they are not fixed at the moment of being experienced and afterwards repeated, but are only elicited at a later age when childhood is already past; in the process they are altered and falsified, and are put into the service of later trends, so that generally speaking they cannot be sharply distinguished from phantasies. Their nature is perhaps best illustrated by a comparison with the way in which the writing of history originated among the peoples of antiquity. As long as a nation was small and weak it gave no thought to the writing of its history. Men tilled the soil of their land, fought for their existence against their neighbours, and tried to gain territory from them and to acquire wealth. It was an age of heroes not of historians. Then came another age, an age of reflection: men felt themselves to be rich and powerful, and now felt a need to learn where they had come from and how they had developed.","The details of the process by which repression changes a possibility of pleasure into a source of \'pain\' are not yet fully understood, or are not yet capable of clear presentation, but it is certain that all neurotic \'pain\' is of this kind, is pleasure which cannot be experienced as such.","All who seek to be nobler than their constitution permits succumb to neurosis; they would have been better in health if they had found it possible to be morally worse.","Who lacks sex speaks about sex, hungry talks about food, a person who has no money - about money, and our oligarchs and bankers talk about morality","A normal dream stands, as it were, on two feet, one of which derives from the actual nature of the occasion for it, the other on a childhood event with serious consequences.","How we who have little belief envy those who are convinced of the existence of a Supreme Power, for whom the world holds no problems because He Himself has created all its institutions!","Men are strong so long as they represent a strong idea; they become powerless when they oppose it. Psycho-analysis will survive this loss and gain new adherents in place of these. In conclusion, I can only express a wish that fortune may grant an agreeable upward journey to all those who have found their stay in the underworld of psycho-analysis too uncomfortable for their taste. The rest of us, I hope, will be permitted without hindrance to carry through to their conclusion our labours in the depths.","I do not in general have the impression that sexual abstinence helps produce energetic, independent men of action or original thinkers, bold liberators and reformers. Far more often it produces well-behaved weaklings who later merge into the great mass of those who habitually, if reluctantly, follow the lead given by strong individuals.","Alg\u0131 , Ben i\xe7in, O\u2019da g\xfcd\xfclerin oynad\u0131\u011f\u0131 role kar\u015f\u0131l\u0131k gelir.

Society","A thing which has not been understood inevitably reappears; like an unlaid ghost, it cannot rest until the mystery has been resolved and the spell broken.","Cruelty is especially near the childish character, since the inhibition which restrains the impulse to mastery before it causes pain to others\u2014that is, the capacity for sympathy\u2014develops comparatively late. As we know, a thorough psychological analysis of this impulse has not as yet been successfully accomplished; we may assume that the cruel feelings emanate from the impulse to mastery and appear at a period in the sexual life before the genitals have taken on their later r\xf4le. It then dominates a phase of the sexual life, which we shall later describe as the pregenital organization. Children who are distinguished for evincing especial cruelty to animals and playmates may be justly suspected of intensive and premature sexual activity in the erogenous zones; and in a simultaneous prematurity of all sexual impulses, the erogenous sexual activity surely seems to be primary. The absence of the barrier of sympathy carries with it the danger that the connections between cruelty and the erogenous impulses formed in childhood cannot be broken in later life.","The act of eating is a destruction of the object with the final aim of incorporating it, and the sexual act is an act of aggression with the purpose of the most intimate union.","The threat to the conditions of his existence through the actual or expected arrival of a new child, the fear of the loss in care and love which is connected with this event, cause the child to become thoughtful and sagacious. Corresponding with the history of this awakening, the first problem with which it occupies itself is not the question as to the difference between the sexes, but the riddle: from where do children come?","the dream is a sort of substitution for those emotional and intellectual trains of thought","Pues all\xed donde el amor despierta, muere el yo, d\xe9spota, sombr\xedo.(Observaciones psicoanal\xedticas sobre un caso de paranoia (Caso \u201cSchreber)\u201d","WE think we have advanced too rapidly. Let us go back a little. Before our last attempt to overcome the difficulties of dream distortion through our technique, we had decided that it would be best to avoid them by limiting ourselves only to those dreams in which distortion is either entirely absent or of trifling importance, if there are such. But here again we digress from the history of the evolution of our knowledge, for as a matter of fact we become aware of dreams entirely free of distortion only after the consistent application of our method of interpretation and after complete analysis of the distorted dream.","Happiness is the belated fulfilment of a prehistoric wish. For this reason wealth brings so little happiness. Money was not a childhood wish.","Anyone thus forced to react continually to precepts that are not the expressions of his impulses lives, psychologically speaking, above his means, and may be objectively described as a hypocrite, whether he is clearly conscious of this difference or not. It is undeniable that our contemporary civilization favors this sort of hypocrisy to an extraordinary extent. One might even venture to assert that it is built upon such a hypocrisy and would have to undergo extensive changes if man were to undertake to live according to the psychological truth. There are therefore more civilized hypocrites than truly cultured persons","...El hecho de que uno entable correspondencia con el ausente, con quien no puede hablar, no es menos natural que el de tratar de hacerse entender por escrito cuando uno ha perdido la voz.","Constitution and Heredity.\u2014In the first place, we must mention here the congenital\xa0variation of the sexual constitution, upon which the greatest weight probably falls, but the existence of which, as may be easily understood, can be established only through its later manifestations and even then not always with great certainty. We understand by it a preponderance of one or another of the manifold sources of the sexual excitement, and we believe that such a difference of disposition must always come to expression in the final result, even if it should remain within normal limits.","The little child is above all shameless, and during its early years it evinces definite pleasure in displaying its body and especially its sexual organs. A counterpart to this desire which is to be considered as perverse, the curiosity to see other persons\' genitals, probably appears first in the later years of childhood when the hindrance of the feeling of shame has already reached a certain development.","en cuanto cierto n\xfamero de seres vivos se re\xfane, tr\xe1tese de un reba\xf1o o de una multitud humana, los elementos individuales se colocan instintivamente bajo la autoridad de un jefe.","La consciencia de la culpabilidad y el sentimiento del deber ser\xedan las dos propiedades caracter\xedsticas del animal gregario.","La multitud es un d\xf3cil reba\xf1o incapaz de vivir sin amo.","Psychoanalysis is right to be mistrustful. One of its rules runs: whatever disturbs the continuation of the work of analysis is a resistance.","We are astonished to hear declarations by married women and girls which bear witness to a quite particular attitude to the therapeutic problem: they had always known, they say, that they could only be cured by love.","At this point it may be objected: well, then, if even the crabbed sceptics admit that the statements of religion cannot be confuted by reason, why should not I believe in them, since they have so much on their side:\xad tradition, the concurrence of mankind, and all the consolation they yield? Yes, why not? Just as no one can be forced into belief, so no one can be forced into unbelief. But do not deceive yourself into thinking that with such arguments you are following the path of correct reasoning. If ever there was a case of facile argument, this is one. Ignorance is ignorance; no right to believe anything is derived from it.","The dreams of little children are often simple fulfilments of wishes, and for this reason are, as compared with the dreams of adults, by no means interesting. They present no problem to be solved, but they are invaluable as affording proof that the dream, in its inmost essence, is the fulfilment of a wish.","Students of human nature and philosophers have long ago taught us that we do wrong to value our intelligence as an independent force and to overlook its dependence upon our emotional life. According to their view our intellect can work reliably only when it is removed from the influence of powerful incitements; otherwise it acts simply as an instrument at the beck and call of our will and delivers the results which the will demands. Logical argumentation is therefore powerless against affective interests; that is why arguing with reasons which, according to Falstaff, are as common as blackberries, are so fruitless where our interests are concerned. Whenever possible psychoanalytic experience has driven home this assertion. It is in a position to prove every day that the cleverest people suddenly behave as unintelligently as defectives as soon as their understanding encounters emotional resistance, but that they regain their intelligence completely as soon as this resistance has been overcome.","At first this gives the impression that the psychical intensity7 of the particular ideas was not taken into consideration at all in their selection for the dream, but only the varying nature and degree of their determination.","\u2026what the behavior of men themselves reveals as the purpose and object of their lives, what they demand of life and wish to attain in it. The answer to this can hardly be in doubt: they seek happiness, they want to become happy and remain so.","This reliance on puns gives Freud an interpretative freedom which might often be considered licence.","The thought suggests itself that a psychical power is operative in the dream-work which on the one hand strips the psychically valuable elements of their intensity, and on the other creates new values by way of over-determination out of elements of low value; it is the new values that then reach the dream-content.","most people report dreaming principally in visual images. Freud, however, assumes that dreams start from a dream-thought that is best expressed in words and translate it into a picture-language which is intellectually inferior because it cannot convey logical connections; the analyst restores to the dream its verbal character.","The first is the Credo quia absurdum of the early Father. It would imply that religious doctrines are outside reason\u2019s jurisdiction; they stand above reason. Their truth must be inwardly felt: one does not need to comprehend them.","The injunction that before making a final decision in any matter one should sleep on it for a night is obviously fully justified.","Freud revelled in linguistic play, but, despite his appreciation of painting and especially sculpture, he did not know what to make of visual imagery in dreams.","N\xe3o existe uma regra de ouro que se aplique a todos: todo homem tem de descobrir por si mesmo de que modo espec\xedfico ele pode ser salvo","The great Leonardo remained like a child for the whole of his life\u2026Even as an adult he continued to play, and this is why he often appeared uncanny and incomprehensible to his contemporaries.","But hypnotism had been of immense help in the cathartic treatment, by widening the field of the patient\'s consciousness and putting within his reach knowledge which he did not possess in his waking life. It seemed no easy task to find a substitute for it. While I was in this perplexity there came to my help the recollection of an experiment which I had often witnessed while I was with Bernheim. When the subject awoke from the state of somnambulism, he seemed to have lost all memory of what had happened while he was in that state. But Bernheim maintained that the memory was present all the same; and if he insisted on the subject remembering, if he asseverated that the subject knew it all and had only to say it, and if at the same time he laid his hand on the subject\'s forehead, then the forgotten memories used in fact to return, hesitatingly at first, but eventually in a flood and with complete clarity. I determined that I would act the same way. My patients I reflected, must in fact \'know\' all the things which had hitherto only been made accessible to them in hypnosis; and assurances and encouragement on my part, assisted perhaps by the touch of my hand, would, I thought, have the power of forcing the forgotten facts and connections into consciousness. No doubt this seemed a more laborious process than putting the patients into hypnosis, but it might prove highly instructive. So I abandoned hypnotism, only retaining my practice of requiring the patient to lie upon a sofa while I sat behind him, seeing him, but not seen myself.","In so far as they have paid any attention to infantile sexuality the educators behave as if they shared our views concerning the formation of the moral forces of defence at the cost of sexuality, and as if they knew that sexual activity makes the child uneducable; for the educators consider all sexual manifestations of the child as an \\"evil\\" in the face of which little can be accomplished. We have, however, every reason for directing our attention to those phenomena so much feared by the educators, for we expect to find in them the solution of the primitive formation of the sexual impulse.","But it is a predisposition of human nature to consider an unpleasant idea untrue, and then it is easy to find arguments against it. Society thus brands what is unpleasant as untrue, denying the conclusions of psychoanalysis with logical and pertinent arguments. These arguments originate from affective sources, however, and society holds to these prejudices against all attempts at refutation.","I must confess that I am not at all partial to the fabrication of Weltanschauungen. Such activities may be left to philosophers, who avowedly find it impossible to make their journey through life without a Baedeker of that kind to give them information on every subject. Let us humbly accept the contempt with which they look down on us from the vatnage-ground of their superior needs. But since we cannot forgot our narcissistic pride either, we will draw comfort from the reflection that such \'Handbooks to Life\' soon grow out of date and that it is precisely our short-sighted, narrow, and finicky work which obliges them to appear in new editions, and that even the most up-to-date of them are nothing but attempts to find a substitute for the ancient, useful and all-sufficient Church Catechism. We know well enough how little light science has so far been able to throw on the problems that surround us. But however much ado the philosophers may make, they cannot alter the situation. Only patient, persevering research, in which everything is subordinated to the one requirement of certainty, can gradually bring about a change. The benighted traveller may sing aloud in the dark to deny his own fears; but, for all that, he will not see an inch further beyond his nose.","The story is told of a famous German chemist that his marriage did not take place, because he forgot the hour of his wedding and went to the laboratory instead of to the church.

It is remarkable that little as men are able to exist in isolation they should yet feel as a heavy burden the sacrifices that culture expects of them in order that a communal existence may be possible.

But if we proceed in the reverse way, if we start from the premises inferred from the analysis and try to follow these up to the final results, then we no longer get the impression of an inevitable sequence of events which could not have otherwise been determined.","[I]n scientific matters it is always experience, and never authority without experience, that gives the final verdict, whether in favour or against.","For those particular illusions there may well have been a past; it is problematic, however, if there is now much of a future.","The uneducated relatives of our patients\u2014persons who are impressed only by the visible and tangible, preferably by such procedure as one sees in the moving picture theatres\u2014never miss an opportunity of voicing their scepticism as to how one can \\"do anything for the malady through mere talk.\\" Such thinking, of course, is as shortsighted as it is inconsistent. For these are the very persons who know with such certainty that the patients \\"merely imagine\\" their symptoms.

Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual\'s dangerous desire for aggression by weakening and disarming it and by setting up an agency within him to watch over it, like a garrison in a conquered city.","Psychoanalytic investigation of the individual teaches with especial emphasis that god is in every case modelled after the father and that our personal relation to god is dependent upon our relation to our physical, fluctuating and changing with him, and that god at bottom is nothing but an exalted father.","It is therefore inevitable that we should seek compensation for the loss of life in the world of fiction, in literature, and in the theater. There we still find people who know how to die, who are even quite capable of killing others. There alone the condition for reconciling ourselves to death is fulfilled, namely, if beneath all the vicissitudes of life a permanent life still remains to us. It is really too sad that it may happen in life as in chess, where a false move can force us to lose the game, but with this difference, that we cannot begin a return match. In the realm of fiction we find the many lives in one for which we crave. We die in identification with a certain hero and yet we outlive him and, quite unharmed, are prepared to die again with the next hero.","Mientras que durante la vigilia piensa y representa el alma en im\xe1genes verbales y por medio del lenguaje, en el sue\xf1o piensa y representa en verdaderas im\xe1genes sensoriales (p\xe1g. 35).

According to them dreams are provoked and initiated exclusively by stimuli proceeding from the senses or the body, which either reach the sleeper from without or are accidental disturbances of his internal organs.","We possess no criterion which enables us to distinguish exactly between a psychical process and a physiological one, between an act occurring in the cerebral cortex and one occurring in the sub-cortical substance; for \'consciousness\', whatever that may be, is not attached to every activity of the cerebral cortex, nor is it always attached in an equal degree to any particular one of its activities; it is not a thing which is bound up with any locality in the nervous system.","The dream is to be regarded, says Binz, \\"as a physical process always useless, frequently morbid.","Alternatives are difficult to represent, and in some cases they are expressed by the division of the dream into two halves of equal length.","The ideas so far produced are insufficient for the interpretation of the dream.","O intalnire cu filozoful William James mi-a lasat o impresie de neuitat. Nu am putut sa nu tin minte aceasta scena: in cursul unei plimbari, el s-a oprit deodata, mi-a incredintat servieta si m-a rugat sa continui drumul, el avand sa ma urmeze de indata ce ii va fi trecut criza de anghina pectorala pe care o presimtea. A murit de inima un an mai tarziu; n-am incetat sa-mi doresc un asemenea curaj in fata sfarsitului apropiat.","It is the relation of similarity, congruence, or convergence, the just like, which dreams have the most various means of expressing better than anything else.","The day thought, which was no wish in itself but rather a worry, had in some way to find a connection with the infantile now unconscious and suppressed wish, which then allowed it, though already properly prepared, to \\"originate\\" for consciousness.","The mind is like an iceberg. It floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water.","Nevertheless several things might be said in criticism of his disappointment. Strictly speaking it is not justified, for it consists in the destruction of an illusion. Illusions commend themselves to us because they save us pain and allow us to enjoy pleasure instead. We must therefore accept it without complaint when they sometimes collide with a bit of reality against which they are dashed to pieces.","It is hard for the ego to direct its attention to perceptions and ideas which it has up till now made a rule of avoiding, or to acknowledge as belonging to itself impulses that are the complete opposite of those which it knows as its own.","The fact is that a survival of all the early stages alongside the final form is only possible in the mind, and that it is impossible for us to represent a phenomenon of this kind in visual terms.","Students of the theory of ethics call only those acts \\"good\\" which are the expression of good impulses and refuse to acknowledge others as such. But society is on the whole guided by practical aims and does not bother about this distinction; it is satisfied if a man adapts his conduct and his actions to the precepts of civilization and asks little about his motives.We have heard that the outer compulsion which education and environment exercise upon a man brings about a further transformation of his impulse life for the good, the change from egotism to altruism. But this is not the necessary or regular effect of the outer compulsion. Education and environment have not only love premiums to offer but work with profit premiums of another sort, namely rewards and punishments. They can therefore bring it about that a person subject to their influence decides in favor of good conduct in the civilized sense without any ennobling of impulse or change from egotistic into altruistic inclinations. On the whole the consequence remains the same; only special circumstances will reveal whether the one person is always good because his impulses compel him to be so while another person is good only in so far as this civilized behavior is of advantage to his selfish purposes. But our superficial knowledge of the individual gives us no means of distinguishing the two cases, and we shall certainly be misled by our optimism into greatly over-estimating the number of people who have been transformed by civilization.Civilized society, which demands good conduct and does not bother about the impulse on which it is based, has thus won over a great many people to civilized obedience who do not thereby follow their own natures. Encouraged by this success, society has permitted itself to be misled into putting the ethical demands as high as possible, thereby forcing its members to move still further from their emotional dispositions. A continual emotional suppression is imposed upon them, the strain of which is indicated by the appearance of the most remarkable reactions and compensations.In the field of sexuality, where such suppression is most difficult to carry out, it results in reactions known as neurotic ailments. In other fields the pressure of civilization shows no pathological results but manifests itself in distorted characters and in the constant readiness of the inhibited impulses to enforce their gratification at any fitting opportunity.","It is almost humiliating that, after working so long, we should still be having difficulty in understanding the most fundamental facts. But we have made up our minds to simplify nothing and to hide nothing. If we cannot see things clearly we will at least see clearly what the obscurities are.","The ego is an organization. It is based on the maintenance of free intercourse and of the possibility of reciprocal influence between all its parts. Its desexualized energy still shows traces of its origin in its impulsion to bind together and unify, and this necessity to synthesize grows stronger in proportion as the strength of the ego increases. It is therefore only natural that the ego should try to prevent symptoms from remaining isolated and alien by using every possible method to bind them to itself in one way or another, and to incorporate them into its organization by means of those bonds. As we know, a tendency of this kind is already operative in the very act of forming a symptom. A classical instance of this are those hysterical symptoms which have been shown to be a compromise between the need for satisfaction and the need for punishment.","We can also add that the generating of anxiety sets symptom-formation going and is, indeed, a necessary prerequisite of it. For if the ego did not arouse the pleasure-unpleasure agency by generating anxiety, it would not obtain the power to arrest the process which is preparing in the id and which threatens danger.","la sugesti\xf3n abre de golpe las puertas que para la autosugesti\xf3n se abrir\xedan lentamente por s\xed mismas.","\u0421\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0428\u043e\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0433\u0430\u0443\u044d\u0440\u0430 \u043e \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0437\u043d\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445, \u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430. \u041f\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443 \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u044c \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u043c\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0434\u044c\u043c\u0438, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u043e: \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430, \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c\u043c\u0438, \u2014 \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u0441\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043a \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u0434\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0432\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f.","The ego now proceeds to behave as though it recognized that the symptom had come to stay and that the only thing to do was to accept the situation in good part and draw as much advantage from it as possible. It makes an adaptation to the symptom\u2014to this piece of the internal world which is alien to it\u2014just as it normally does to the real external world. It can always find plenty of opportunities for doing so. The presence of a symptom may entail a certain impairment of capacity, and this can be exploited to appease some demand on the part of the super-ego or to refuse some claim from the external world. In this way the symptom gradually comes to be the representative of important interests; it is found to be useful in asserting the position of the self and becomes more and more closely merged with the ego and more and more indispensable to it.","We have all found by experience that it is especially difficult for an obsessional neurotic to carry out the fundamental rule of psycho-analysis. [...] While he is engaged in thinking, his ego has to keep off too much\u2014the intrusion of unconscious phantasies and the manifestation of ambivalent trends. It must not relax, but is constantly prepared for a struggle.","Anyone thus forced to react continually to precepts that are not the expressions of his impulses lives, psychologically speaking, above his means, and may be objectively described as a hypocrite, whether he is clearly conscious of this difference or not. It is undeniable that our contemporary civilization favors this sort of hypocrisy to an extraordinary extent. One might even venture to assert that it is built upon such a hypocrisy and would have to undergo extensive changes if man were to undertake to live according to the psychological truth. There are therefore more civilized hypocrites than truly cultured persons, and one can even discuss the question whether a certain amount of civilized hypocrisy is not indispensable to maintain civilization because the already organized cultural adaptability of the man of today would perhaps not suffice for the task of living according to the truth. On the other hand the maintenance of civilization even on such questionable grounds offers the prospect that with every new generation a more extensive transformation of impulses will pave the way for a better civilization.These discussions have already afforded us the consolation that our mortification and painful disappointment on account of the uncivilized behavior of our fellow world citizens in this war were not justified. They rested upon an illusion to which we had succumbed. In reality they have not sunk as deeply as we feared because they never really rose as high as we had believed.","In reality the ego is like the clown in the circus, who is always putting in his oar to make the audience think that whatever happens is his doing.","It is to be feared that our need to find a single, tangible \u2018ultimate cause\u2019 of neurotic illness will remain unsatisfied. The ideal solution, which medical men no doubt still yearn for, would be to discover some bacillus which could be isolated and bred in a pure culture and which, when injected into anyone, would invariably produce the same illness; or, to put it rather less extravagantly, to demonstrate the existence of certain chemical substances the administration of which would bring about or cure particular neuroses. But the probability of a solution of this kind seems slight.","Rank hoped that if this primal trauma were dealt with by a subsequent analysis the whole neurosis would be got rid of. [...] And a few months should be enough to accomplish this. It cannot be disputed that Rank\'s argument was bold and ingenious; but it did not stand the test of critical examination. Moreover, it was a child of its time, conceived under the stress of the contrast between the post-war misery of Europe and the \'prosperity\' of America, and designed to adapt the tempo of analytic therapy to the haste of American life.","Twice in the course of individual development certain instincts are considerably reinforced: at puberty, and, in women, at the menopause. We are not in the least surprised if a person who was not neurotic before becomes so at these times. When his instincts were not so strong, he succeeded in taming them; but when they are reinforced he can no longer do so. The repressions behave like dams against the pressure of water.","The earlier psychic state may not have manifested itself for years but nevertheless continues to exist to the extent that it may some day again become the form in which psychic forces express themselves, in fact the only form, as though all subsequent developments had been annulled and made regressive. This extraordinary plasticity of psychic development is not without limits as to its direction; one can describe it as a special capacity for retrograde action or regression, for it sometimes happens that a later and higher stage of development that has been abandoned cannot be attained again. But the primitive conditions can always be reconstructed; the primitive psyche is in the strictest sense indestructible.","Desde que superamos o erro de achar que nosso habitual esquecimento significa uma destrui\xe7\xe3o do tra\xe7o mnem\xf4nico, tendemos \xe0 suposi\xe7\xe3o contr\xe1ria de que na vida ps\xedquica nada que uma vez se formou pode acabar, de que tudo \xe9 preservado de alguma maneira e poder ser trazido novamente \xe0 luz em circunst\xe2ncias adequadas, mediante uma regress\xe3o de largo alcance, por exemplo.","Das \xdcber-Ich k\xfcmmert sich in der Strenge seiner Gebote und Verbote zu wenig um das Gl\xfcck des Ichs, indem es die Widerst\xe4nde gegen die Befolgung, die Triebst\xe4rke des Es und die Schwierigkeiten der realen Umwelt nicht gen\xfcgend in Rechnung bringt.

The ego is the source of three of these, each differing in its dynamic nature. The first of these three ego-resistances is the repression resistance, which we have already discussed above and about which there is least new to be added. Next there is the transference resistance, which is of the same nature but which has different and much clearer effects in analysis, since it succeeds in establishing a relation to the analytic situation or the analyst himself and thus re-animating a repression which should only have been recollected. The third resistance, though also an ego-resistance, is of quite a different nature. It proceeds from the gain from illness and is based upon an assimilation of the symptom into the ego. It represents an unwillingness to renounce any satisfaction or relief that has been obtained. The fourth variety, arising from the id, is the resistance which, as we have just seen, necessitates \u2018working-through\u2019. The fifth, coming from the super-ego and the last to be discovered, is also the most obscure though not always the least powerful one. It seems to originate from the sense of guilt or the need for punishment; and it opposes every move towards success, including, therefore, the patient\'s own recovery through analysis.","Eros desires contact because it strives to make the ego and the loved object one, to abolish all spatial barriers between them. But destructiveness, too, which (before the invention of long-range weapons) could only take effect at close quarters, must presuppose physical contact, a coming to grips.","Geometria este \u015ftiin\u0163a care trage concluzii corecte din figuri incorecte","We have formed the idea that in each individual there is a coherent organization of mental processes; and we call this his ego. It is to this ego that consciousness is attached; the ego controls the approaches to motility-that is, to the discharge of excitations into the external world; it is the mental agency which supervises all its own constituent processes, and which goes to sleep at night, though even then it exercises the censorship on dreams.","Unexpressed emotions will never dieThey are buried alive, and will come forth later, in uglier ways.-Sigmund Freud\' From: A Silent Patient","Nevertheless the ego, it appears, cannot be accused of inconsistency. Being of a peaceable disposition it would like to incorporate the symptom and make it part of itself. It is from the symptom itself that the trouble comes. For the symptom, being the true substitute for and derivative of the repressed impulse, carries on the role of the latter; it continually renews its demands for satisfaction and thus obliges the ego in its turn to give the signal of unpleasure and put itself in a posture of defence.","If we have thus come to a fresh understanding of our estranged fellow citizens we can more easily bear the disappointment which nations have caused us, for of them we must only make demands of a far more modest nature. They are perhaps repeating the development of the individual and at the present day still exhibit very primitive stages of development with a correspondingly slow progress towards the formation of higher unities. It is in keeping with this that the educational factor of an outer compulsion to morality, which we found so active in the individual, is barely perceptible in them. We had indeed hoped that the wonderful community of interests established by intercourse and the exchange of products would result in the beginning of such a compulsion, but it seems that nations obey their passions of the moment far more than their interests. At most they make use of their interests to justify the gratification of their passions.It is indeed a mystery why the individual members of nations should disdain, hate, and abhor each other at all, even in times of peace. I do not know why it is. It seems as if all the moral achievements of the individual were obliterated in the case of a large number of people, not to mention millions, until only the most primitive, oldest, and most brutal psychic inhibitions remained.Perhaps only later developments will succeed in changing these lamentable conditions. But a little more truthfulness and straightforward dealing on all sides, both in the relation of people towards each other and between themselves and those who govern them, might smooth the way for such a change.","We will turn, therefore, to the less ambitious problem: what the behaviour of men themselves reveals as the purpose and object of their lives, what they demand of life and wish to attain in it. The answer to this can hardly be in doubt: they seek happiness, they want to become happy and to remain so.","The communists believe that they have found the path to deliverance from our evils. According to them, man is wholly good and is well-disposed to his neighbour; but the institution of private property has corrupted his nature. The ownership of private wealth gives the individual power, and with it the temptation to ill-treat his neighbour; while the man who is excluded from possession is bound to rebel in hostility against his oppressor. If private property were abolished, all wealth held in common, and everyone allowed to share in the enjoyment of it, ill-will and hostility would disappear among men. Since everyone\u2019s needs would be satisfied, no one would have any reason to regard another as his enemy; all would willingly undertake the work that was necessary.I have no concern with any economic criticisms of the communist system; I cannot enquire into whether the abolition of private property is expedient or advantageous. But I am able to recognize that the psychological premisses on which the system is based are an untenable illusion. In abolishing private property we deprive the human love of aggression of one of its instruments, certainly a strong one, though certainly not the strongest; but we have in no way altered the differences in power and influence which are misused by aggressiveness, nor have we altered anything in its nature. Aggressiveness was not created by property. It reigned almost without limit in primitive times, when property was still very scanty, and it already shows itself in the nursery almost before property has given up its primal, anal form; it forms the basis of every relation of affection and love among people (with the single exception, perhaps, of the mother\u2019s relation to her male child). If we do away with personal rights over material wealth, there still remains prerogative in the field of sexual relationships, which is bound to become the source of the strongest dislike and the most violent hostility among men who in other respects are on an equal footing. If we were to remove this factor, too, by allowing complete freedom of sexual life and thus abolishing the family, the germ-cell of civilization, we cannot, it is true, easily foresee what new paths the development of civilization could take; but one thing we can expect, and that is that this indestructible feature of human nature, will follow it there.","I am finding it very difficult; it is almost beyond my powers of presentation; the paper will probably be intelligible to no one outside our immediate circle. How bungled our reproductions are, how wretchedly we dissect the great art works of psychic nature! Unfortunately this paper in turn is becoming too bulky. It just pours out of me, and even so it\'s inadequate, incomplete and therefore untrue. A wretched business.","Analysis, however, enables the ego, which has attained greater maturity and strength, to undertake a revision of these old repressions; a few are demolished, while others are recognized but constructed afresh out of more solid material. These new dams are of quite a different degree of firmness from the earlier ones; we may be confident that they will not give way so easily before a rising flood of instinctual strength. Thus the real achievement fo analytic therapy would be the subsequent correction of the original process of repression, a correction which puts an end to the dominance of the quantitative factor.","O sofrer nos amea\xe7a a partir de tr\xeas lados: do pr\xf3prio corpo, que fadado ao decl\xednio e \xe0 dissolu\xe7\xe3o, n\xe3o pode sequer dispensar a dor e o medo, como sinais de advert\xeancia; e, por fim, das rela\xe7\xf5es com os outros seres humanos.","Thus we may perhaps be forced to become reconciled to the idea that it is quite impossible to adjust the claims of the sexual instinct to the demands of civilization; that in consequence of its cultural development renunciation and suffering, as well as the danger of extinction in the remotest future, cannot be avoided by the human race.","\u10e0\u10d0\u10ea \u10e3\u10e4\u10e0\u10dd \u10d9\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8\u10da\u10e8\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10d0 \u10d0\u10d3\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8, \u10db\u10d8\u10d7 \u10db\u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d4\u10ed\u10d5\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8 \u10db\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 \u10e1\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10d3\u10d8\u10e1, \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10e1\u10d0\u10d1\u10dd\u10da\u10dd\u10dd \u10ef\u10d0\u10db\u10e8\u10d8, \u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10e1 \u10e3\u10d1\u10dd\u10e0\u10dd\u10e2\u10d4\u10e1 \u10ea\u10dd\u10d3\u10d5\u10d4\u10d1\u10e8\u10d8 \u10e1\u10ec\u10dd\u10e0\u10d4\u10d3 \u10d8\u10e1\u10d8\u10dc\u10d8 \u10d0\u10d3\u10d0\u10dc\u10d0\u10e8\u10d0\u10e3\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10dc, \u10d5\u10d8\u10dc\u10ea \u10e7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10d0\u10d6\u10d4 \u10e8\u10dd\u10e0\u10e1 \u10ec\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8\u10d3\u10d0 \u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0\u10dc\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1\u10d9\u10d4\u10dc \u10db\u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10d5\u10d0\u10da \u10d2\u10d6\u10d0\u10d6\u10d4.","Nietzsche had more penetrating knowledge of himself than any man who ever lived or was likely to live.","Nunca dominaremos completamente a natureza, e nosso organismo, ele mesmo parte dessa natureza, ser\xe1 sempre uma constru\xe7\xe3o transit\xf3ria, limitada em adequa\xe7\xe3o e desemprenho.","Originally the ego includes everything, later it detaches from itself the external world.","At one point in the course of this discussion, the idea took possession of us that culture was a peculiar process passing over human life and we are still under the influence of this idea.

To take this situation by itself for a moment, we can illustrate it by an example from another field. Let us imagine a country in which a certain small faction objects to a proposed measure the passage of which would have the support of the masses. This minority obtains command of the press and by its help manipulates the supreme arbiter, \u2018public opinion\u2019, and so succeeds in preventing the measure from being passed.","What happens is that the affect left out when the obsessional idea is perceived appears in a different place.

There are obsessional neuroses in which no sense of guilt whatever is present.

These symptoms, however, represent at the same time a satisfaction of masochistic impulses which, in their turn, have been reinforced by regression.","Eitington, whom I met in Florence, is now here and will probably visit me soon to give me detailed impressions of Amsterdam.

[...] We thus gave the biological aspect of the anxiety affect its due importance by recognizing anxiety as the general reaction to situations of danger; while we endorsed the part played by the ego as the seat of anxiety by allocating to it the function of producing the anxiety affect according to its needs.","It will be an undoubted advantage, I think, to revert to the old concept of \u2018defence\u2019, provided we employ it explicitly as a general designation for all the techniques which the ego makes use of in conflicts which may lead to a neurosis, while we retain the word \u2018repression\u2019 for the special method of defence which the line of approach taken by our investigations made us better acquainted with in the first instance.","Here we may be assisted by the idea that a defence against an unwelcome internal process will be modelled upon the defence adopted against an external stimulus, that the ego wards off internal and external dangers alike along identical lines.","Los neur\xf3ticos obsesivos graves acuden al tratamiento psicoanal\xedtico en n\xfamero mucho menor que los hist\xe9ricos.","religion succeeds in saving many people from individual neuroses.

What we hope is that this information and this warning will have the effect of activating in him one of the conflicts we have indicated, in a modest degree and yet sufficiently for treatment. [...] The expected result does not come about. The patient hears our message, but there is no response. He may think to himself: \'This is very interesting, but I feel no trace of it.\' We have increased his knowledge, but altered nothing else in him. The situation is much the same as when people read psycho-analytic writings. The reader is \'stimulated\' only by those passages which he feels apply to himself \u2014 that is, which concern conflicts that are active in him at the time. Everything else leaves him cold. We can have analogous experiences, I think, when we give children sexual enlightenment. I am far from maintaining that this is a harmful or unnecessary thing to do, but it is clear that the prophylactic effect of this liberal measure has been greatly over-estimated. After such enlightenment, children know something they did not know before, but they make no use of the new knowledge that has been presented to them.","La vida sexual actual de los neur\xf3ticos obsesivos puede parecer muchas veces, a un observador superficial, absolutamente normal, pues ofrece frecuentemente menos factores pat\xf3genos y menos anormalidades que la de nuestro paciente.","Life becomes impoverished and loses its interest when life itself, the highest stake in the game of living, must not be risked. It becomes as hollow and empty as an American flirtation in which it is understood from the beginning that nothing is to happen, in contrast to a continental love affair in which both partners must always bear in mind the serious consequences. Our emotional ties, the unbearable intensity of our grief, make us disinclined to court dangers for ourselves and those belonging to us. We do not dare to contemplate a number of undertakings that are dangerous but really indispensable, such as aeroplane flights, expeditions to distant countries, and experiments with explosive substances. We are paralyzed by the thought of who is to replace the son to his mother, the husband to his wife, or the father to his children, should an accident occur.","On d\xe9couvrit alors que l\'homme devient n\xe9vros\xe9 parce qu\'il ne peut supporter le degr\xe9 de renoncement exig\xe9 par la soci\xe9t\xe9 au nom de son id\xe9al culturel, et l\'on en conclut qu\'abolir ou diminuer notablement ces exigences signifierait un retour \xe0 des possibilit\xe9s de bonheur.\xa0\xa0 Il est encore une autre cause de d\xe9sillusion.","The ego is first and foremost a bodily ego; it is not merely a surface entity, but is itself the projection of a surface.","The final transformation which the fear of the super-ego undergoes is, it seems to me, the fear of death (or fear for life) which is a fear of the super-ego projected on to the powers of destiny.","But a normal ego of this sort is, like normality in general, an ideal fiction. The abnormal ego, which is unserviceable for our purposes, is unfortunately no fiction. Every normal person, in fact, is only normal on the average. His ego approximates to that of the psychotic in some part or other and to a greater or lesser extent; and the degree of its remoteness from one end of the series and of its proximity to the other will furnish us with a provisional measure of what we have so indefinitely termed an \'alteration of the ego\'.","If the ego succeeds in protecting itself from a dangerous instinctual impulse, through, for instance, the process of repression, it has certainly inhibited and damaged the particular part of the id concerned; but it has at the same time given it some independence and has renounced some of its own sovereignty. This is inevitable from the nature of repression, which is, fundamentally, an attempt at flight. The repressed is now, as it were, an outlaw; it is excluded from the great organization of the ego and is subject only to the laws which govern the realm of the unconscious. If, now, the danger-situation changes so that the ego has no reason for fending off a new instinctual impulse analogous to the repressed one, the consequence of the restriction of the ego which has taken place will become manifest. The new impulse will run its course under an automatic influence\u2014or, as I should prefer to say, under the influence of the compulsion to repeat. It will follow the same path as the earlier, repressed impulse, as though the danger-situation that had been overcome still existed. The fixating factor in repression, then, is the unconscious id\'s compulsion to repeat\u2014a compulsion which in normal circumstances is only done away with by the freely mobile function of the ego.","Derfor vil vi heller stille det mindre pretensi\xf8se sp\xf8rsm\xe5let om hva menneskene i sin atferd selv stiller opp som m\xe5l og hensikt med livet, hva de krever av det, og hva de vil oppn\xe5 med det. Svaret her er neppe til \xe5 ta feil av. De streber etter lykken, de vil v\xe6re og forbli lykkelige. Denne streben er tosidig med et positivt og et negativt m\xe5l; p\xe5 den ene siden viker vi unna for ulyst og smerte, p\xe5 den andre siden \xf8nsker vi \xe5 oppleve sterke lystf\xf8lelser. I overensstemmelse med denne spalting i m\xe5lsettingen streber menneskene i to retninger, alt etter som de s\xf8ker \xe5 virkeliggj\xf8re det ene eller det andre m\xe5let.

Hele altets innretninger motarbeider det, og man f\xf8ler seg fristet til \xe5 si: Den hensikt \xe5 gj\xf8re mennesket \xablykkelig\xbb, er ikke med i \xabskapelsesplanen\xbb. Hva man i engere forstand kaller lykke, skyldes den plutselige tilfredsstillelse av et lenge oppdemmet behov og er derfor i sin natur mulig kun rent episodisk. Enhver konstans, enhver vedvaren i en situasjon med utspring i lystprinsippet, gir bare et lunkent velv\xe6re. Vi er slik innrettet at vi bare kan nyte kontrasten intensivt, selve tilstanden blir svak i sammenligning. V\xe5re muligheter til \xe5 oppleve lykke reduseres p\xe5 den m\xe5ten ved v\xe5r konstitusjon. Ulykken lar seg nok langt lettere erfare.

In some cases one has the impression that the outcome is an enforced one: the regressive attraction exerted by the repressed impulse and the strength of the repression are so great that the new impulse has no choice but to obey the compulsion to repeat. In other cases we perceive a contribution from another play of forces: the attraction exerted by the repressed prototype is reinforced by a repulsion coming from the direction of difficulties in real life which stand in the way of any different course that might be taken by the new instinctual impulse.impression that the outcome is an enforced one: the regressive attraction exerted by the repressed impulse and the strength of the repression are so great that the new impulse has no choice but to obey the compulsion to repeat.

In obsessional neuroses the danger is much more internalized. That portion of anxiety in regard to the super-ego which constitutes social anxiety still represents an internal substitute for an external danger, while the other portion \u2014 moral anxiety \u2014 is already completely endo-psychic.","Among the factors that play a part in the causation of neuroses and that have created the conditions under which the forces of the mind are pitted against one another, three emerge into prominence: a biological, a phylogenetic and a purely psychological factor.","Los sue\xf1os quedan as\xed definidos como la actividad an\xedmica del durmiente durante el estado de reposo.","We have found that the sexual life of man, unlike that of most of the animals nearly related to him, does not make a steady advance from birth to maturity, but that, after an early efflorescence up till the fifth year, it undergoes a very decided interruption; and that it then starts on its course once more at puberty, taking up again the beginnings broken off in early childhood. This has led us to suppose that something momentous must have occurred in the vicissitudes of the human species which has left behind this interruption in the sexual development of the individual as a historical precipitate. This factor owes its pathogenic significance to the fact that the majority of the instinctual demands of this infantile sexuality are treated by the ego as dangers and fended off as such, so that the later sexual impulses of puberty, which in the natural course of things would be ego-syntonic, run the risk of succumbing to the attraction of their infantile prototypes and following them into repression.","Les mots provoquent des \xe9motions et constituent pour les hommes le moyen g\xe9n\xe9ral de s\'influencer r\xe9ciproquement.","In view of the dangers of [external] reality, the ego is obliged to guard against certain instinctual impulses in the id and to treat them as dangers. But it cannot protect itself from internal instinctual dangers as effectively as it can from some piece of reality that is not part of itself. Intimately bound up with the id as it is, it can only fend off an instinctual danger by restricting its own organization and by acquiescing in the formation of symptoms in exchange for having impaired the instinct. If the rejected instinct renews its attack, the ego is overtaken by all those difficulties which are known to us as neurotic ailments.","La soci\xe9t\xe9 transforme le d\xe9sagr\xe9able en injuste.","the psychologicalpremisses on which the system is based are an untenable illusion. In abolishingprivate property we deprive the human love of aggression of one of itsinstruments, certainly a strong one, though certainly not the strongest; but wehave in no way altered the differences in power and influence which are misusedby aggressiveness, nor have we altered anything in its nature. Aggressivenesswas not created by property. It reigned almost without limit in primitive times,when property was still very scanty, and it already shows itself in the nurseryalmost before property has given up its primal, anal form; it forms the basis ofevery relation of affection and love among people (with the single exception,perhaps, of the mother\u2019s relation to her male child). If we do away with personalrights over material wealth, there still remains prerogative in the field of sexualrelationships, which is bound to become the source of the strongest dislike andthe most violent hostility among men who in other respects are on an equalfooting. If we were to remove this factor, too, by allowing complete freedom ofsexual life and thus abolishing the family, the germ-cell of civilization, wecannot, it is true, easily foresee what new paths the development of civilizationcould take; but one thing we can expect, and that is that this indestructiblefeature of human nature, will follow it there.","Jeg tror at den hellighet vi tilkjennegir de ti bud, sl\xf8ver v\xe5r sans for erkjennelse av virkeligheten.","This study of the determinants of anxiety has, as it were, shown the defensive behaviour of the ego transfigured in a rational light. Each situation of danger corresponds to a particular period of life or a particular developmental phase of the mental apparatus and appears to be justifiable for it.","[T]he ego has to try from the very outset to fulfil its task of mediating between its id and the external world in the service of the pleasure principle, and to protect the id from the dangers of the external world. [...] Thereafter, under the influence of education, the ego grows accustomed to removing the scene of the fight from outside to within and to mastering the internal danger before it has become an external one; and probably it is most often right in doing so.","Such a powerful inhibition can only be directed against an equally strong impulse. What no human being desires to do does not have to be forbidden, it is self-exclusive. The very emphasis of the commandment: Thou shalt not kill, makes it certain that we are descended from an endlessly long chain of generations of murderers, whose love of murder was in their blood as it is perhaps also in ours. The ethical strivings of mankind, with the strength and significance of which we need not quarrel, are an acquisition of the history of man; they have since become, though unfortunately in very variable quantities, the hereditary possessions of people of today.","Philosophers stretch the meaning of words until they retain scarcely anything of their original sense. They give the name of \u2018God\u2019 to some vague abstraction which they have created for themselves; having done so they can pose before all the world as deists, as believers in God, and they can even boast that they have recognized a higher, purer concept of God, notwithstanding that their God is now nothing more than an insubstantial shadow and no longer the mighty personality of religious doctrines.","En efecto, es muy posible fundir en un solo concepto ambas condiciones etiol\xf3gicas; todo depende de la definici\xf3n que concedamos a lo traum\xe1tico. Si podemos aceptar que el car\xe1cter traum\xe1tico de una vivencia s\xf3lo reside en un factor cuantitativo; si, por consiguiente, el hecho de que una vivencia despierte reacciones ins\xf3litas, patol\xf3gicas, siempre obedece al exceso de demandas que plantee al psiquismo, entonces ser\xe1 f\xe1cil establecer el concepto de que frente a determinada constituci\xf3n puede actuar como trauma algo que frente a otra distinta no tendr\xeda semejante efecto.

Teniendo en cuenta estas consideraciones se puede desechar la diferenciaci\xf3n entre la etiolog\xeda traum\xe1tica y la no traum\xe1tica, por carecer de importancia para la analog\xeda que procuramos estatuir.","An important element in the theory of repression is the view that repression is not an event that occurs once but that it requires a permanent expenditure [of energy]. If this expenditure were to cease, the repressed impulse, which is being fed all the time from its sources, would on the next occasion flow along the channels from which it had been forced away, and the repression would either fail in its purpose or would have to be repeated an indefinite number of times.","This is perhaps the real secret of heroism. The rational basis of heroism is dependent upon the decision that one\'s own life cannot be worth as much as certain abstract common ideals. But I believe that instinctive or impulsive heroism is much more frequently independent of such motivation and simply defies danger on the assurance which animated Hans, the stone-cutter, a character in Anzengruber, who always said to himself: Nothing can happen to me.","Dans le travail scientifique, il est plus rationnel de s\'attaquer \xe0 ce qu\'on a devant soi, \xe0 des objets qui s\'offrent d\'eux-m\xeames \xe0 notre investigation.","[hypnosis] does not permit us. . .to recognize the resistance with which the patient clings to his disease and thus even fights against his own recovery; yet it is this phenomenon of resistance which alone makes it possible to comprehend his behavior in daily life.","A case arises for our consciousness, just as it did for primitive man, in which the two opposite attitudes towards death, one of which acknowledges it as the destroyer of life, while the other denies the reality of death, clash and come into conflict. The case is identical for both, it consists of the death of one of our loved ones, of a parent or a partner in wedlock, of a brother or a sister, of a child or a friend. These persons we love are on the one hand a part of our inner possessions and a constituent of our own selves, but on the other hand they are also in part strangers and even enemies. Except in a few instances, even the tenderest and closest love relations also contain a bit of hostility which can rouse an unconscious death wish. [...] The layman feels an extraordinary horror at the possibility of such an emotion and takes his aversion to it as a legitimate ground for disbelief in the assertions of psychoanalysis. I think he is wrong there. No debasing of our love life is intended and none such has resulted. It is indeed foreign to our comprehension as well as to our feelings to unite love and hate in this manner, but in so far as nature employs these contrasts she brings it about that love is always kept alive and fresh in order to safeguard it against the hate that is lurking behind it. It may be said that we owe the most beautiful unfolding of our love life to the reaction against this hostile impulse which we feel in our hearts.","In general, so far as we can tell from our observations of town children belonging to the white races and living according to fairly high cultural standards, the neuroses of childhood are in the nature of regular episodes in a child\'s development, although too little attention is still being paid to them.","[W]ar cannot be abolished; as long as the conditions of existence among races are so varied and the repulsions between them are so vehement, there will have to be wars. The question then arises whether we shall be the ones to yield and adapt ourselves to it. Shall we not admit that in our civilized attitude towards death we have again lived psychologically beyond our means? Shall we not turn around and avow the truth? Were it not better to give death the place to which it is entitled both in reality and in our thoughts and to reveal a little more of our unconscious attitude towards death which up to now we have so carefully suppressed? This may not appear a very high achievement and in some respects rather a step backwards, a kind of regression, but at least it has the advantage of taking the truth into account a little more and of making life more bearable again. To bear life remains, after all, the first duty of the living. The illusion becomes worthless if it disturbs us in this.We remember the old saying:Si vis pacem, para bellum.If you wish peace, prepare for war.The times call for a paraphrase:Si vis vitam, para mortem.If you wish life, prepare for death.","This struggle (...between the instinct of life and the instinct of destruction) is what all life essentially consists of, and the evolution of civilization may therefore be simply described as the struggle for life of the human species. And it is this battle that our nurse-maids try to appease with their lullaby about Heaven.","Les souvenirs p\xe9nibles s\u2019effacent difficilement, reviennent sans cesse, quoi qu\'on fasse pour les \xe9touffer, et vous torturent sans r\xe9pit.","La vie psychique est un champ de bataille et une ar\xe8ne o\xf9 luttent des tendances oppos\xe9es","Civilization is something which was imposed on a resisting majority by a minority which understood how to obtain possession of the means to power and coercion.","Words were originally magic, and the word retains much of its old magical power even to-day. With words one man can make another blessed, or drive him to despair; by words the teacher transfers his knowledge to the pupil; by words the speaker sweeps his audience with him and determines its judgments and decisions. Words call forth effects and are the universal means of influencing human beings. Therefore","no serious book can now be sure of surviving.","Nevertheless, repression is something quite peculiar and is more sharply differentiated from the other mechanisms than they are from one another. I should like to make this relation to the other mechanisms clear by an analogy [...] Let us imagine what might have happened to a book, at a time when books were not printed in editions but were written out individually. We will suppose that a book of this kind contained statements which in later times were regarded as undesirable [...] At the present day, the only defensive mechanism to which the official censorship could resort would be to confiscate and destroy every copy of the whole edition. At that time, however, various methods were used for making the book innocuous. One way would be for the offending passages to be thickly crossed through so that they were illegible. In that case they could not be transcribed, and the next copyist of the book would produce a text which was unexceptionable but which had gaps in certain passages, and so might be unintelligible in them. Another way, however, if the authorities were not satisfied with this, but wanted also to conceal any indication that the text had been mutilated, would be for them to proceed to distort the text. Single words would be left out or replaced by others, and new sentences interpolated. Best of all, the whole passage would be erased and a new one which said exactly the opposite put in its place. The next transcriber could then produce a text that aroused no suspicion but which was falsified.","An attempt may be made to raise the objection that the analogy goes wrong in an essential point, for the distortion of a text is the work of a tendentious censorship, no counterpart to which is to be found in the development of the ego. But this is not so; for a tendentious purpose of this kind is to a great extent represented by the compelling force of the pleasure principle. The psychical apparatus is intolerant of unpleasure; it has to fend it off at all costs, and if the perception of reality entails unpleasure, that perception \u2014 that is, the truth \u2014 must be sacrificed.","[O]ne cannot flee from oneself; flight is no help against internal dangers. And for that reason the defensive mechanisms of the ego are condemned to falsify one\'s internal perception and to give one only an imperfect and distorted picture of one\'s id. In its relations to the id, therefore, the ego is paralysed by its restrictions or blinded by its errors; and the result of this in the sphere of psychical events can only be compared to being out walking in a country one does not know and without having a good pair of legs.","No one individual, of course, makes use of all the possible mechanisms of defence. Each person uses no more than a selection of them. But these become fixated in his ego. They become regular modes of reaction of his character, which are repeated throughout his life whenever a situation occurs that is similar to the original one. This turns them into infantilisms, and they share the fate of so many institutions which attempt to keep themselves in existence after the time of their usefulness has passed. \'Vernunft wird Unsinn, Wohltat Plage\' as the poet complains.","No podemos sino atenernos a la conclusi\xf3n de que en la vida ps\xedquica la conservaci\xf3n de lo pret\xe9rito es la regla m\xe1s bien que una curiosa excepci\xf3n.","During the treatment our therapeutic work is constantly swinging backwards and forwards like a pendulum between a id-analysis and a piece of ego-analysis. In the one case we want to make something from the id conscious, in the other we want to correct something in the ego. The crux of the matter is that the defensive mechanisms directed against former danger recur in the treatment as resistances against recovery. It follows from this that the ego treats recovery itself as a new danger.","Das Ich sei zuallererst ein k\xf6rperliches und werde durchzogen von Triebkr\xe4ften, die entlang von k\xf6rperlichen Vorg\xe4ngen ihre Organisation erfahren.","Through what process does the individual reach a higher stage of morality? The first answer will probably be: He is really good and noble from birth, in the first place. It is hardly necessary to give this any further consideration. The second answer will follow the suggestion that a process of development is involved here and will probably assume that this development consists in eradicating the evil inclinations of man and substituting good inclinations under the influence of education and cultural environment. In that case we may indeed wonder that evil should appear again so actively in persons who have been educated in this way.But this answer also contains the theory which we wish to contradict. In reality there is no such thing as \\"eradicating\\" evil. Psychological, or strictly speaking, psychoanalytic investigation proves, on the contrary, that the deepest character of man consists of impulses of an elemental kind which are similar in all human beings, the aim of which is the gratification of certain primitive needs. These impulses are in themselves neither good or evil. We classify them and their manifestations according to their relation to the needs and demands of the human community. It is conceded that all the impulses which society rejects as evil, such as selfishness and cruelty, are of this primitive nature.","siento","In other words, we have once more come unawares upon the riddle which has so often confronted us: whence does neurosis come\u2014what is its ultimate, its own peculiar raison d\'\xeatre? After tens of years of psychoanalytic labours, we are as much in the dark about this problem as we were at the start.","Man seems not to have been endowed, or to have been endowed to only a very small degree, with an instinctive recognition of the dangers that threaten him from without.","During the work on the resistances the ego withdraws \u2014 with a greater or less degree of seriousness \u2014 from the agreement on which the analytic situation is founded. The ego ceases to support our efforts at uncovering the id; it opposes them, disobeys the fundamental rule of analysis, and allows no further derivatives of the repressed to emerge. [...] The patient now regards the analysts as no more than a stranger who is making disagreeable demands on him, and he behaves towards him exactly like a child who does not like the stranger and does not believe anything he says. If the analyst tries to explain to the patient one of the distortions made by him for the purposes of defence, and to correct it, he finds him uncomprehending and inaccessible to sound arguments.","As crian\xe7as s\xe3o completamente ego\xedstas; sentem suas necessidades intensamente e lutam impiedosamente para satisfaz\xea-las - especialmente contravos rivais, outras crian\xe7as, e primeiro e antes de tudo contra seus irm\xe3os e irm\xe3s.

Others, like the fear of small animals, thunderstorms, etc., might perhaps be accounted for as vestigial traces of the congenital preparedness to meet real dangers which is so strongly developed in other animals. In man, only that part of this archaic heritage is appropriate which has reference to the loss of the object. If childhood phobias become fixated and grow stronger and persist into later years, analysis shows that their content has become associated with instinctual demands and has come to stand for internal dangers as well.","Je vous montrerai que toute votre culture ant\xe9rieure et toutes les habitudes de votre pens\xe9e ont d\xfb faire de vous in\xe9vitablement des adversaires de la psychanalyse, et je vous dirai ce que vous devez vaincre en vous-m\xeame pour surmonter cette hostilit\xe9 instinctive.","Bolnavii de nevroz\u0103 obsesional\u0103 sunt preocupa\u0163i f\u0103r\u0103 \xeentrerupere de durata vie\u0163ii \u015fi de posibilitatea mor\u0163ii altor persoane.

But we do not have to break fresh ground in order to find a way out of the difficulty. The solution has been at hand for a long time and lies in the fact that what we are concerned with are scarcely ever pure instinctual impulses but mixtures in various proportions of the two groups of instincts. If this is so, there is no need to revise our view of the organizations of the libido. A sadistic cathexis of an object may also legitimately claim to be treated as a libidinal one; and an aggressive impulse against the father can just as well be subjected to repression as a tender impulse towards the mother.","Limitation in the possibility of an enjoyment raises the value of the enjoyment.","Therefore, let us not undervalue small signs; perhaps by means of them we will succeed in getting on the track of greater things.","Ben\u2019in i\u015flevsel \xf6nemi, devinim \xfczerindeki kontrol\xfcn normal olarak onun pay\u0131na d\xfc\u015fmesinde ifadesini bulur.

We have hitherto regarded it as an affective signal of danger; but now, since the danger is so often one of castration, it appears to us as a reaction to a loss, a separation.","No stronger impression arises from the resistances during the work of analysis than of there being a force which is defending itself by every possible means against recovery and which is absolutely resolved to hold on to illness and suffering.","D\xfc\u015fmanl\u0131\u011f\u0131n hi\xe7bir doyum ihtimali yoktur, bu y\xfczden \u2013 yani ekonomik nedenlerden \xf6t\xfcr\xfc \u2013 daha fazla doyum, yani bo\u015fal\u0131m olana\u011f\u0131 sunan sevgi yakla\u015f\u0131m\u0131yla yer de\u011fi\u015ftirir.Sigmund Freud, \u2018Ben ve O\u2019, sayfa 77\u201d","Normal, bilin\xe7li su\xe7luluk duygusunun (vicdan) yorumunda herhangi bir zorluk yoktur.

Numerous facts of normal mental life call for an explanation of this kind, and the sharper our eye grows, the more copiously they strike us.","[T]he theory of Empedocles which especially deserves our interest is one which approximates so closely to the psychoanalytic theory of the instincts that we should be tempted to maintain that the two are identical, if it were not for the difference that the Greek philosopher\'s theory is a cosmic phantasy while ours is content to claim biological validity.","...la civilizaci\xf3n todav\xeda no ha sido capaz de difundirse en las almas de la mayor\xeda de los hombres sin una acumulaci\xf3n explosiva de energ\xedas destructoras.","Eros und Ananke sind auch die Eltern der menschlichen Kultur geworden.","Sigmund Freud was an Austrian neurologist best known for developing the theories and techniques of psychoanalysis.","The fateful question for the human species seems to me to be whether and to what extent their cultural development will succeed in mastering the disturbance of their communal life by the human instinct of aggression and self-destruction.","filozoflar\u0131n tan\u0131d\u0131\u011f\u0131 ruhsal,psikanalizin tan\u0131d\u0131\u011f\u0131 ruhsaldan ayr\u0131 bir \u015feydi.filozoflar\u0131n b\xfcy\xfck \xe7o\u011funlu\u011fu salt bilin\xe7li olaylara ruhsal ad\u0131n\u0131 vermekteydi.bilin\xe7li d\xfcnyayla ruhsal\u0131n kapsam\u0131 birbiriyle \xe7ak\u0131\u015fmaktayd\u0131 filozoflara g\xf6re....filozoflara g\xf6re ruhun bilin\xe7li fenomenlerden ba\u015fka bir i\xe7eri\u011fi yoktu.","The impression forces itself upon one that men measure by false standards, that everyone seeks power, success, riches for himself and admires others who attain them, while undervaluing the truly precious things in life.","The chief task during the latency period seems to be the fending-off of the temptation to masturbate. This struggle produces a series of symptoms which appear in a typical fashion in the most different individuals and which in general have the character of a ceremonial. It is a great pity that no one has as yet collected them and systematically analysed them.","It is therefore reasonable to expect of an analyst, as a part of his qualifications, a considerable degree of mental normality and correctness. In addition, he must possess some kind of superiority, so that in certain analytic situations he can act as a model for his patient and in others as a teacher. And finally we must not forget that the analytic relationship is based on a love of truth \u2014 that is, on a recognition of reality \u2014 and that it precludes any kind of sham or deceit.","y si no estuviese habituado a designar a tales personas con el nombre de neur\xf3ticos obsesivos hallar\xeda muy adecuado el nombre de enfermedad del tab\xfa para caracterizar sus estados.","But besides having this special feature which is difficult to isolate, we notice that anxiety is accompanied by fairly definite physical sensations which can be referred to particular organs of the body. [...] The clearest and most frequent ones are those connected with the respiratory organs and with the heart. They provide evidence that motor innervations\u2014that is, processes of discharge\u2014play a part in the general phenomenon of anxiety.","1o La falta de motivaci\xf3n de las prescripciones; 2o Su imposici\xf3n por una necesidad interna; 3o Su facultad de desplazamiento y contagio, y 4o La causaci\xf3n de actos ceremoniales y de prescripciones, emanados de las prohibiciones mismas.","It almost looks as if analysis were the third of those \'impossible\' professions in which one can be sure beforehand of achieving unsatisfying results. The other two, which have been known much longer, are education and government.","bisogna svelarsi come il solo malvagio fra tutte le nobili persone con le quali si spartisce la vita","We assume, in other words, that an anxiety-state is the reproduction of some experience which contained the necessary conditions for such an increase of excitation and a discharge along particular paths, and that from this circumstance the unpleasure of anxiety receives its specific character. In man, birth provides a prototypic experience of this kind, and we are therefore inclined to regard anxiety-states as a reproduction of the trauma of birth.","Bar\xe1tom \xedgy sz\xf3lt hozz\xe1m akkor az Andr\xe1ssy-\xfaton: Semmi emberi nem idegen t\u0151lem, mire \xe9n - pszichoanalitikus tapasztalatokra c\xe9lozva - megjegyeztem: Messzebb is mehetn\xe9l enn\xe9l, \xe9s beismerhetn\xe9d, hogy semmi \xe1llati nem idegen t\u0151led.","We will therefore turn to the less ambitious question of what men themselves show by their behavior to be the purpose and intention of their lives. What do they demand of life and wish to achieve in it? The answer to this can hardly be in doubt. They strive for happiness; they want to become happy and to remain so. This endeavor has two sides, a positive and a negative aim. It aims, on the one hand, at an absence of pain and unpleasure, and, on the other, at the experiencing of strong feelings of pleasure. In its narrower sense the word \'happiness\' only relates to the last. In conformity with this dichotomy in his aims, man\'s activity develops in two directions, according as it seeks to realize \u2014 in the main, or even exclusively \u2014 the one or the other of these aims.","prohibici\xf3n, porque sin ella hubiera penetrado la","Just as the ego controls the path to action in regard to the external world, so it controls access to consciousness.","Our aim will not be to rub off every peculiarity of human character for the sake of a schematic \'normality\', nor yet to demand that the person who has been \'thoroughly analysed\' shall feel no passions and develop no internal conflicts. The business of the analysis is to secure the best possible psychological conditions for the functions of the ego; with that it has discharged its task","We have decided to consider pleasure and \'pain\' in relation to the quantity of excitation present in the psychic life\u2014and not confined in any way\u2014along such lines that \'pain\' corresponds with an increase and pleasure with a decrease in this quantity.","In my opinion the other affects are also reproductions of very early, perhaps even pre-individual, experiences of vital importance; and I should be inclined to regard them as universal, typical and innate hysterical attacks, as compared to the recently and individually acquired attacks which occur in hysterical neuroses and whose origin and significance as mnemic symbols have been revealed by analysis.","Implacable, though not always on that account successful, severity is shown in condemning the temptation to continue early infantile masturbation, which now attaches itself to regressive (sadistic-anal) ideas but which nevertheless represents the unsubjugated part of the phallic organization.","In order to understand a hysterical attack, all one has to do is to look for the situation in which the movements in question formed part of an appropriate and expedient action.","Many writers have laid much stress on the weakness of the ego in relation to the id and of our rational elements in the face of the daemonic forces within us; and they display a strong tendency to make what I have said into a corner-stone of a psycho-analytic Weltanschauung. Yet surely the psycho-analyst, with his knowledge of the way in which repression works, should, of all people, be restrained from adopting such an extreme and one-sided view.","pleasure or \\"pain\\" may be thought of in psycho-physical relationship to conditions of stability and instability,","I must confess that I am not at all partial to the fabrication of Weltanschauungen. Such activities may be left to philosophers, who avowedly find it impossible to make their journey through life without a Baedeker of that kind to give them information on every subject. Let us humbly accept the contempt with which they look down on us from the vantage-ground of their superior needs. But since we cannot forgo our narcissistic pride either, we will draw comfort from the reflection that such \u2018Handbooks to Life\u2019 soon grow out of date and that it is precisely our short-sighted, narrow and finicky work which obliges them to appear in new editions, and that even the most up-to-date of them are nothing but attempts to find a substitute for the ancient, useful and all-sufficient Church Catechism. We know well enough how little light science has so far been able to throw on the problems that surround us. But however much ado the philosophers may make, they cannot alter the situation. Only patient, persevering research, in which everything is subordinated to the one requirement of certainty, can gradually bring about a change. The benighted traveller may sing aloud in the dark to deny his own fears; but, for all that, he will not see an inch further beyond his nose.","\u038c\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5, \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1 \u03be\u03c5\u03c0\u03bd\u03ac \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b7 \u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bf\u03b9 \u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1. \u039f \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03cd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b5\u03be\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03bc\u03af\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd. \u038c\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03b8\u03c9\u03c3\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03c9\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03bf, \u03c4\u03b1 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c6\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd. \u039a\u03b9 \u03ad\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03af \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b7. \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae \u03b7 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03c3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03ad\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03c9\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\'\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03ba\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\' \u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b2\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af.","Die Strenge der ethischen Forderungen w\xfcrde nicht viel schaden, wenn die Erziehung sagte: So sollten die Menschen sein, um gl\xfccklich zu werden und andere gl\xfccklich zu machen; aber man mu\xdf damit rechnen, da\xdf sie nicht so sind.

Not only will the early aggressive impulses be re-awakened; but a greater or lesser proportion of the new libidinal impulses\u2014in bad cases the whole of them\u2014will have to follow the course prescribed for them by regression and will emerge as aggressive and destructive tendencies.

I think that if we adopt this view all the facts fall into place. The situation of non-satisfaction in which the amounts of stimulation rise to an unpleasurable height without its being possible for them to be mastered psychically or discharged must for the infant be analogous to the experience of being born\u2014must be a repetition of the situation of danger. What both situations have in common is the economic disturbance caused by an accumulation of amounts of stimulation which require to be disposed of. It is this factor, then, which is the real essence of the \u2018danger\u2019.","It shows that the idea of being devoured by the father gives expression, in a form that has undergone regressive degradation, to a passive, tender impulse to be loved by him in a genital-erotic sense.","Is it, moreover, a question merely of the replacement of the [psychical] representative by a regressive form of expression or is it a question of a genuine regressive degradation of the genitally-directed impulse in the id?

If it succeeds in making an instinct regress, it will actually have done it more injury than it could have by repressing it. Sometimes, indeed, after forcing an instinct to regress in this way, it goes on to repress it.","Schuldgef\xfchle, ... sind die fundamentalen Kr\xe4fte, die Gro\xdfz\xfcgigkeit und Altruismus zugrundeliegen.","The process of repression had attacked almost all the components of his Oedipus complex\u2014both his hostile and his tender impulses towards his father and his tender impulses towards his mother.","Cowabunga","But the affect of anxiety, which was the essence of the phobia, came, not from the process of repression, not from the libidinal cathexes of the repressed impulses, but from the repressing agency itself. The anxiety belonging to the animal phobias was an untransformed fear of castration.","Quando uma solteirona solit\xe1ria transfere sua afei\xe7\xe3o para animais, ou um solteir\xe3o se torna um entusi\xe1stico colecionador, quando um soldado defende um farrapo de pano colorido - uma bandeira - com o sangue de sua vida, quando a press\xe3o extra de um aperto de m\xe3o significa bem-aventuran\xe7a para aquele que ama, ou quando, em Otelo, um len\xe7o perdido precipita uma explos\xe3o de c\xf3lera - tudo isso constitui exemplos de deslocamentos ps\xedquicos, aos quais n\xe3o levantamos nenhuma obje\xe7\xe3o.

The formula, \u2018separation and expulsion from the horde\u2019, only applies to that later portion of the super-ego which has been formed on the basis of social prototypes, not to the nucleus of the super-ego, which corresponds to the introjected parental agency.","As far as can be seen at present, the majority of phobias go back to an anxiety of this kind felt by the ego in regard to the demands of the libido. It is always the ego\'s attitude of anxiety which is the primary thing and which sets repression going. Anxiety never arises from repressed libido.","Finalmente, h\xe1 outro fato que se deve ter em mente como capaz de levar os sonhos a serem esquecidos, a saber, que a maioria das pessoas t\xeam muito pouco interesse pelos seus sonhos.

The individual citizen can prove with dismay in this war what occasionally thrust itself upon him already in times of peace, namely, that the state forbids him to do wrong not because it wishes to do away with wrongdoing but because it wishes to monopolize it, like salt and tobacco. A state at war makes free use of every injustice, every act of violence, that would dishonor the individual. It employs not only permissible cunning but conscious lies and intentional deception against the enemy, and this to a degree which apparently outdoes what was customary in previous wars. The state demands the utmost obedience and sacrifice of its citizens, but at the same time it treats them as children through an excess of secrecy and a censorship of news and expression of opinion which render the minds of those who are thus intellectually repressed defenseless against every unfavorable situation and every wild rumor. It absolves itself from guarantees and treaties by which it was bound to other states, makes unabashed confession of its greed and aspiration to power, which the individual is then supposed to sanction out of patriotism.","At one time I attached some importance to the view that what was used as a discharge of anxiety was the cathexis which had been withdrawn in the process of repression. To-day this seems to me of scarcely any interest. The reason for this is that whereas I formerly believed that anxiety invariably arose automatically by an economic process, my present conception of anxiety as a signal given by the ego in order to affect the pleasure-unpleasure agency does away with the necessity of considering the economic factor.","Why do the animals, kin to ourselves, not manifest any such cultural struggle? Oh, we don\u2019t know. Very probably certain of them, bees, ants, termites, had to strive for thousands of centuries before they found the way to those state institutions, that division of functions, those restrictions upon individuals, which we admire them for today.","Lo mejor es siempre enemigo de lo bueno","The symptoms belonging to this neurosis fall, in general, into two groups, each having an opposite trend. They are either prohibitions, precautions and expiations\u2014that is, negative in character\u2014or they are, on the contrary, substitutive satisfactions which often appear in symbolic disguise. The negative, defensive group of symptoms is the older of the two; but as illness is prolonged, the satisfactions, which scoff at all defensive measures, gain the upper hand. The symptom-formation scores a triumph if it succeeds in combining the prohibition with satisfaction so that what was originally a defensive command or prohibition acquires the significance of a satisfaction as well; and in order to achieve this end it will often make use of the most ingenious associative paths.","Si colocamos en un orden arbitrario las palabras de un verso, nos ser\xe1 muy dif\xedcil retenerlo as\xed en nuestra memoria. \xabBien ordenadas y en sucesi\xf3n l\xf3gica, se ayudan unas palabras a otras, y la totalidad plena de sentido es f\xe1cilmente recordada durante largo tiempo.

[...] This looks as though the ego were attempting to save itself from anxiety, which it has learned to keep in suspension for a while, and to bind it by the formation of symptoms.","This action undertaken to protect repression is observable in analytic treatment as resistance. Resistance presupposes the existence of what I have called anticathexis.","Analysis shows that when activities like playing the piano, writing or even walking are subjected to neurotic inhibitions it is because the physical organs brought into play\u2014the fingers or the legs\u2014have become too strongly erotized. It has been discovered as a general fact that the ego-function of an organ is impaired if its erotogenicity \u2014 its sexual significance \u2014 is increased. It behaves, if I may be allowed a rather absurd analogy, like a maid-servant who refuses to go on cooking because her master has started a love-affair with her.","Kita tidak bisa menghindari kesan bahwa manusia umumnya menggunakan standar yang keliru. Mereka mencari kekuatan, sukses, dan kekayaan untuk diri mereka sendiri, memuji diri mereka sendiri di hadapan orang lain dan mereka memandang rendah pada apa yang sebenarnya berharga dalam hidup.","The first of our questions was: \'Is it possible by means of analytic therapy to dispose of a conflict between an instinct and the ego, or a pathogenic instinctual demand upon the ego, permanently and definitely?\' To avoid misunderstanding it is not unnecessary, perhaps, to explain more exactly what is meant by \'permanently disposing of an instinctual demand\'. [...] we mean something else, something which may be roughly described as a \'taming\' of the instinct. That is to say, the instinct is brought completely into the harmony of the ego, becomes accessible to all the influences of the other trends in the ego and no longer seeks to go its independent way to satisfaction. If we are asked by what methods and means this result is achieved, it is not easy to find an answer. We can only say: \'So muss den doch die Hexe dran!\' \u2014 the Witch Metapsychology.","In describing the evolution of the various danger-situations from their prototype, the act of birth, I have had no intention of asserting that every later determinant of anxiety completely invalidates the preceding one. It is true that, as the development of the ego goes on, the earlier danger-situations tend to lose their force and to be set aside, so that we might say that each period of the individual\'s life has its appropriate determinant of anxiety. Thus the danger of psychical helplessness is appropriate to the period of life when his ego is immature; the danger of loss of object, to early childhood when he is still dependent on others; the danger of castration, to the phallic phase; and the fear of his super-ego, to the latency period. Nevertheless, all these danger-situations and determinants of anxiety can persist side by side and cause the ego to react to them with anxiety at a period later than the appropriate one; or, again, several of them can come into operation at the same time. It is possible, moreover, that there is a fairly close relationship between the danger-situation that is operative and the form taken by the ensuing neurosis.","La totalidad de las fuentes on\xedricas puede dividirse en cuatro especies; divisi\xf3n que ha servido tambi\xe9n de base para clasificar los sue\xf1os: 1.

[...] it appears probable that, as a determinant of anxiety, loss of love plays much the same part in hysteria as the threat of castration does in phobias and fear of the super-ego in obsessional neurosis.","pues no soy ni esto ni lo otro, ni soy, en realidad, nada muy a fondo.","Con s\xf3lo temer a la mediocridad, ya se est\xe1 a salvo: he aqu\xed el consuelo que usted me ofrece.

And even he who was not tied down to the same spot by the exigencies of life could combine all the advantages and charms of civilized countries into a newer and greater fatherland which he could enjoy without hindrance or suspicion. He thus took delight in the blue and the grey ocean, the beauty of snow clad mountains and of the green lowlands, the magic of the north woods and the grandeur of southern vegetation, the atmosphere of landscapes upon which great historical memories rest, and the peace of untouched nature. The new fatherland was to him also a museum, filled with the treasure that all the artists of the world for many centuries had created and left behind. While he wandered from one hall to another in this museum he could give his impartial appreciation to the varied types of perfection that had been developed among his distant compatriots by the mixture of blood, by history, and by the peculiarities of physical environment. Here cool, inflexible energy was developed to the highest degree, there the graceful art of beautifying life, elsewhere the sense of law and order, or other qualities that have made man master of the earth.","Emo\xe7\xf5es n\xe3o expressadas jamais morrem.

A hysterical woman, for instance, may be specially affectionate with her own children whom at bottom she hates; but she will not on that account be more loving in general than other women or even more affectionate to other children. The reaction-formation of hysteria clings tenaciously to a particular object and never spreads over into a general disposition of the ego, whereas what is characteristic of obsessional neurosis is precisely a spreading-over of this kind\u2014a loosening of relations to the object and a facilitation of displacement in the choice of object.","H\u0131rsl\u0131 adam, d\xfc\u015flerinde, kazanm\u0131\u015f oldu\u011fu(ya da kazand\u0131\u011f\u0131n\u0131 hayal etti\u011fi) ya da kazanmak istedi\u011fi defne dal\u0131ndanta\xe7lan g\xf6r\xfcr; oysa \xe2\u015f\u0131k, d\xfc\u015flerinde, tatl\u0131 umutlann\u0131n nesnesiyleu\u011fra\u015fmaktad\u0131r...

It suggests that there is an intimate connection between repression and external anticathexis on the one hand and between regression and internal anticathexis (i.e. alteration of the ego through reaction-formation) on the other.","An analytic treatment demands from both doctor and patient the accomplishment of serious work, which is employed in lifting internal resistances. Through the overcoming of these resistances the patient\'s mental life is permanently changed, is raised to a higher level of development and remains protected against fresh possibilities of falling ill.","Nor is it to be wondered at that the loosening of moral ties between the large human units has had a pronounced effect upon the morality of the individual, for our conscience is not the inexorable judge that teachers of ethics say it is; it has its origin in nothing but \\"social fear.\\" Wherever the community suspends its reproach the suppression of evil desire also ceases, and men commit acts of cruelty, treachery, deception, and brutality, the very possibility of which would have been considered incompatible with their level of culture.","The ego is, indeed, the organized portion of the id.","The two techniques I refer to are undoing what has been done and isolating. The first of these has a wide range of application and goes back very far. It is, as it were, negative magic, and endeavours, by means of motor symbolism, to \u2018blow away\u2019 not merely the consequences of some event (or experience or impression) but the event itself. I choose the term \u2018blow away\u2019 advisedly, so as to remind the reader of the part played by this technique not only in neuroses but in magical acts, popular customs and religious ceremonies as well. [...] The same purpose may perhaps account for the obsession for repeating which is so frequently met with in this neurosis and the carrying out of which serves a number of contradictory intentions at once. When anything has not happened in the desired way it is undone by being repeated in a different way; and thereupon all the motives that exist for lingering over such repetitions come into play as well. [...] The second of these techniques which we are setting out to describe for the first time, that of isolation, is peculiar to obsessional neurosis. It, too, takes place in the motor sphere. When something unpleasant has happened to the subject or when he himself has done something which has a significance for his neurosis, he interpolates an interval during which nothing further must happen\u2014during which he must perceive nothing and do nothing.","First published in 1893 and written in collaboration with Josef Breuer (1842-1925),","We should be quite wrong if we pictured the ego and the id as two opposing camps and if we supposed that, when the ego tries to suppress a part of the id by means of repression, the remainder of the id comes to the rescue of the endangered part and measures its strength with the ego. This may often be what happens, but it is certainly not the initial situation in repression. As a rule the instinctual impulse which is to be repressed remains isolated.","As the neurosis proceeds, we often find that the endeavour to undo a traumatic experience is a motive of first-rate importance in the formation of symptoms.","The formation of reactions against certain impulses give the deceptive appearance of a change of content, as if egotism had become altruism and cruelty had changed into sympathy. The formation of these reactions is favored by the fact that many impulses appear almost from the beginning in contrasting pairs; this is a remarkable state of affairs called the ambivalence of feeling and is quite unknown to the layman. This feeling is best observed and grasped through the fact that intense love and intense hate occur so frequently in the same person. Psychoanalysis goes further and states that the two contrasting feelings not infrequently take the same person as their object.What we call the character of a person does not really emerge until the fate of all these impulses has been settled, and character, as we all know, is very inadequately defined in terms of either \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\".","\u039f \u03a3\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03c1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03be\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03c9\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ce\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c8\u03b1\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1.","\xcendr\u0103gostitul este foarte nebun.","Nevertheless it may be admitted that the therapeutic efforts of psycho-analysis have chosen a similar line of approach. Its intention is, indeed, to strengthen the ego, to make it more independent of the superego, to widen its field of perception and enlarge its organization, so that it can appropriate fresh portions of the id. Where id was, there ego shall be. [Wo es war, soll Ich werden.]","[T]he mental process which has been turned into a symptom owing to repression now maintains its existence outside the organization of the ego and independently of it. Indeed, it is not that process alone but all its derivatives which enjoy, as it were, this same privilege of extra-territoriality; and whenever they come into associative contact with a part of the ego-organization, it is not at all certain that they will not draw that part over to themselves and thus enlarge themselves at the expense of the ego. An analogy with which we have long been familiar compared a symptom to a foreign body which was keeping up a constant succession of stimuli and reactions in the tissue in which it was embedded.","La sugesti\xf3n, en efecto, no puede producir nada que no se halle ya entre los contenidos de la consciencia o que no haya sido introducido en ella.","A good deal of what has been said may be objected to on the ground that the unpleasant obsessive ideas are themselves quite conscious. But there is no doubt that before becoming conscious they have been through the process of repression. In most of them the actual wording of the aggressive instinctual impulse is altogether unknown to the ego, and it requires a good deal of analytic work to make it conscious. What does penetrate into consciousness is usually only a distorted substitute which is either of a vague, dream-like and indeterminate nature or so travestied as to be unrecognizable. Even where repression has not encroached upon the content of the aggressive impulse it has certainly got rid of its accompanying affective character. As a result, the aggressiveness appears to the ego not to be an impulsion but, as the patients themselves say, merely a \u2018thought\u2019 which awakens no feeling.","The transformation of \\"evil\\" impulses is the result of two factors operating in the same sense, one inwardly and the other outwardly. The inner factor consists in influencing the evil or selfish impulses through erotic elements, the love needs of man interpreted in the widest sense. The addition of erotic components transforms selfish impulses into social impulses. We learn to value being loved as an advantage for the sake of which we can renounce other advantages. The outer factor is the force of education which represents the demands of the civilized environment and which is then continued through the direct influence of the cultural milieu.[...] The influences of civilization work through the erotic components to bring about the transformation of more and more of the selfish tendencies into altruistic and social tendencies. We may indeed assume that the inner compulsion which makes itself felt in the development of man was originally, that is, in the history of mankind, a purely external compulsion. Today people bring along a certain tendency (disposition) to transform the egotistic into social impulses as a part of their hereditary organization, which then responds to further slight incentives to complete the transformation. A part of this transformation of impulse must also be made during life. In this way the individual man is not only under the influence of his own contemporary cultural milieu but is also subject to the influences of his ancestral civilization.","But even so, one can just as well hold God responsible for the existence of the devil as for the evil he personifies.","Die r\xfchrende, im Grunde so kindliche Elternliebe ist nichts anderes als der wiedergeborene Narzi\xdfmus der Eltern, der in seiner Umwandlung zur Objektliebe sein einstiges Wesen unverkennbar offenbart.","If we call a person\'s individual capacity for transforming his egotistical impulses under the influence of love his cultural adaptability, we can say that this consists of two parts, one congenital and the other acquired, and we may add that the relation of these two to each other and to the untransformed part of the emotional life is a very variable one.In general we are inclined to rate the congenital part too highly, and are also in danger of over-valuing the whole cultural adaptability in its relation to that part of the impulse life which has remained primitive, that is, we are misled into judging people to be \\"better\\" than they really are.","N\xe3o quebro muitas vezes a cabe\xe7a a prop\xf3sito da quest\xe3o do bem e do mal, mas, em m\xe9dia, descobri muito pouco \xabbem\xbb entre os homens.

The normal phenomenon of concentration provides a pretext for this kind of neurotic procedure: what seems to us important in the way of an impression or a piece of work must not be interfered with by the simultaneous claims of any other mental processes or activities. But even a normal person uses concentration to keep away not only what is irrelevant or unimportant, but, above all, what is unsuitable because it is contradictory. He is most disturbed by those elements which once belonged together but which have been torn apart in the course of his development\u2014as, for instance, by manifestations of the ambivalence of his father-complex in his relation to God, or by impulses attached to his excretory organs in his emotions of love. Thus, in the normal course of things, the ego has a great deal of isolating work to do in its function of directing the current of thought. And, as we know, we are obliged, in carrying out our analytic technique, to train it to relinquish that function for the time being, eminently justified as it usually is.","The aggressive impulse flows mainly from the destructive instinct; and we have always believed that in a neurosis it is against the demands of the libido and not against those of any other instinct that the ego is defending itself.","Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God.
