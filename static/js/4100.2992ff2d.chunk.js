Why should a government which is doing what it believes to be right allow itself to be criticized? It would not allow opposition by lethal weapons. Ideas are much more fatal things than guns. Why should any man be allowed to buy a printing press and disseminate pernicious opinions calculated to embarrass the government?","The goal of socialism is communism.","The press should be not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator, but also a collective organizer of the masses.","Truth is the most precious thing. That\'s why we should ration it.","People always have been and they always will be stupid victims of deceit and self-deception in politics.","Give me just one generation of youth, and I\'ll transform the whole world.","One man with a gun can control 100 without one.","Medicine is the keystone of the arch of socialism.","As an ultimate objective, \\"peace\\" simply means communist world control.","It is, of course, much easier to shout, abuse, and howl than to attempt to relate, to explain.","Atheism is a natural and inseparable part of Marxism, of the theory and practice of scientific socialism. Our program necessarily includes the propaganda of atheism.","The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.","One of the basic conditions for the victory of socialism is the arming of the workers Communist and the disarming of the bourgeoisie the middle class.","The establishment of a central bank is 90% of communizing a nation.","Germany will militarize herself out of existence, England will expand herself out of existence, and America will spend herself out of existence.","Give us the child for eight years and it will be a Bolshevik forever.","There are no morals in politics; there is only expedience. A scoundrel may be of use to us just because he is a scoundrel.","The best way to destroy the capitalist system is to debauch the currency.","We are not shooting enough professors.","There can be nothing more abominable than religion.","We want to achieve a new and better order of society: in this new and better society there must be neither rich nor poor; all will have to work. Not a handful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of their common labour. Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is called socialist society.","Dictatorship is rule based directly upon force and unrestricted by any laws. The revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat is rule won and maintained by the use of violence by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, rule that is unrestricted by any laws.","I don\'t care what becomes of Russia. To hell with it. All this is only the road to a World Revolution.","Democracy is indispensable to socialism.","It is necessary - secretly and urgently to prepare the terror.","You must act with all energy. Mass searches. Execution for concealing arms.","The oppressed are allowed once every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class are to represent and repress them in parliament.","Of all the arts, for us the cinema is the most important.","Pacifism, the preaching of peace in the abstract, is one of the means of duping the working class.","Only an armed people can be the real bulwark of popular liberty.","Free speech is a bourgeois prejudice.","You must have your heart on fire and your brain on ice.","There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.","The aim of socialism is not only to abolish the present division of mankind into smaller states and all-national isolation, not only to bring the nations closer to each other, but also to merge them.","Give me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted.","Trust is good, but control is better.","The art of any propagandist and agitator consists in his ability to find the best means of influencing any given audience, by presenting a definite truth, in such a way as to make it most convincing, most easy to digest, most graphic, and most strongly impressive.","It is true that liberty is precious; so precious that it must be carefully rationed.","When it comes to hang the capitalists they will compete with each other to sell us the rope at a lower price.","Three keys to success: read, read, read.","How can you make a revolution without executions?","Atheism is the natural and inseparable part of Communism.","America has become one of the foremost countries in regard to the depth of the abyss which lies between the handful of arrogant multimillionaires who wallow in filth and luxury, and the millions of working people who constantly live on the verge of pauperism.","No Marxist can deny that the interests of socialism are higher than the interests of the right of nations to self-determination.","One of the chief symptoms of every revolution is the sharp and sudden increase in the number of ordinary people who take an active, independent and forceful interest in politics.","The only one who doesn\'t make mistakes is the one who doesn\'t do anything.","We need the real, nation-wide terror which reinvigorates the country and through which the Great French Revolution achieved glory.","The soundest strategy in war is to postpone operations until the moral disintegration of the enemy renders the delivery of the mortal blow both possible and easy.","Comrades! The kulak uprising in your five districts must be crushed without pity. You must make example of these people. (1) Hang (I mean hang publicly, so that people see it) at least 100 kulaks, rich bastards, and known bloodsuckers. (2) Publish their names. (3) Seize all their grain. (4) Single out the hostages per my instructions in yesterday\'s telegram. Do all this so that for miles around people see it all, understand it, tremble, and tell themselves that we are killing the bloodthirsty kulaks and that we will continue to do so ...Find tougher people.","By destroying the peasant economy and driving the peasant from the country to the town, the famine creates a proletariat... Furthermore the famine can and should be a progressive factor not only economically. It will force the peasant to reflect on the bases of the capitalist system, demolish faith in the tsar and tsarism, and consequently in due course make the victory of the revolution easier... Psychologically all this talk about feeding the starving and so on essentially reflects the usual sugary sentimentality of our intelligentsia.","Give me a child for the first 5 years of his life and he will be mine forever.","He who does not work shall not eat","Fascism is capitalism in decay.","Only by abolishing private property in land and building cheap and hygienic dwellings can the housing problem be solved.","We must not depict socialism as if socialists will bring it to us on a plate all nicely dressed. That will never happen. Not a single problem of the class struggle has ever been solved in history except by violence. When violence is exercised by the working people, by the mass of exploited against the exploiters -- then we are for it!","We Social-Democrats always stand for democracy, not \\"in the name of capitalism,\\" but in the name of clearing the path for our movement, which clearing is impossible without the development of capitalism.","Whenever the cause of the people is entrusted to professors, it is lost.","No mercy for these enemies of the people, the enemies of socialism, the enemies of the working people! War to the death against the rich and their hangers-on, the bourgeois intellectuals; war on the rogues, the idlers and the rowdies!","Capitalists will sell us the rope we will hang them with.","Learning is never done without errors and defeat.","Honesty in politics is the result of strength; hypocrisy is the result of weakness.","Those who are opposed to armed uprising ... must be ruthlessly kicked out as enemies, traitors and cowards.","Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.","We must pursue the removal of church property by any means necessary in order to secure for ourselves a fund of several hundred million gold rubles.","But every little difference may become a big one if it is insisted on.","One must always try to be as radical as reality itself.","One fool can ask more questions in a minute than 12 wise men can answer in an hour.","We do not have time to play at \\"oppositions\\" at \\"conferences.\\" We will keep our political opponents... whether open or disguised as \\"nonparty,\\" in prison.","During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes constantly hounded them, received their theories with the most savage malice, the most furious hatred and the most unscrupulous campaigns of lies and slander. After their death, attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons, to canonize them, so to say, and to hallow their names to a certain extent for the \u201cconsolation\u201d of the oppressed classes and with the object of duping the latter, while at the same time robbing the revolutionary theory of its substance, blunting its revolutionary edge and vulgarizing it.","But democracy is by no means a limit one may not overstep; it is only one of the stages in the course of development from feudalism to capitalism, and from capitalism to Communism.","It is necessary to be able to withstand all this, to agree to any and every sacrifice, and even - if need be - to resort to all sorts of stratagems, manoeuvres and illegal methods, to evasion and subterfuges in order to penetrate the trade unions, to remain in them, and to carry on Communist work in them at all costs.","Communists have become bureaucrats. If anything will destroy us, it is this.","The bourgeoisie is many times stronger than we. To give it the weapon of freedom of the press is to ease the enemy\'s cause, to help the class enemy. We do not desire to end in suicide, so we will not do this.","You cannot make a revolution in white gloves.","Everyone is free to write and say whatever he likes, without any restrictions.","Any cook should be able to run the country.","Only struggle educates the exploited class. Only struggle discloses to it the magnitude of its own power, widens its horizon, enhances its abilities, clarifies its mind, forges its will.","But I can\'t listen to music too often. It affects your nerves, makes you want to say stupid, nice things, and stroke the heads of people who could create such beauty while living in this vile hell.","Our program necessarily includes the propaganda of atheism.","It is not national interests we are upholding - we claim that the interests of socialism, the interests of world socialism, rank higher than national interests, higher than the interests of the state. We are defenders of the socialist fatherland.","One cannot live in society and be free from society.","Monopolies, oligarchy, the striving for domination and not for freedom, the exploitation of an increasing number of small or weak nations by a handful of the richest or most powerful nations -- all these have given birth to those distinctive characteristics of imperialism which compel us to define it as parasitic or decaying capitalism.","Don\'t be afraid to admit defeat. Learn from defeat. Do over again more thoroughly, more carefully, and more systematically what you have done badly.","Democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich -- that is the democracy of capitalist society.","A democracy is a state which recognizes the subjection of the minority to the majority, that is, an organization for the systematic use of violence by one class against the other, by one part of the population against another.","We would be deceiving both ourselves and the people if we concealed from the masses the necessity of a desperate, bloody war of extermination, as the immediate task of the coming revolutionary action.","Soviet power is a new type of state in which there is no bureacracy, no police, no standing army.","No amount of political freedom will satisfy the hungry masses.","I am a bad, wicked man, but I am practicing moral self-purification; I don\'t eat meat any more, I now eat rice cutlets.","The suppression of the bourgeois state by the proletarian state is impossible without violent revolution.","The true leader must submerge himself in the fountain of the people.","You can become a Communist only when you enrich your mind with a knowledge of all the treasures created by mankind.","You cannot do anything without rousing the masses to action. A plenary meeting of the Soviet must be called to decide on mass searches in Petrograd and the goods stations. To carry out\\nthese searches, each factory and company must form contingents, not on a voluntary basis: it must be the duty of everyone to take part in these searches under the threat of being deprived of\\nhis bread card. We can\'t expect to get anywhere unless we resort to terrorism: speculators must be shot on the spot. Moreover, bandits must be dealt with just as resolutely: they must be\\nshot on the spot.","Authority poisons everybody who takes authority on himself.","Autocracy cannot do without its twin agents: a hangman and a priest, the first to suppress popular resistance by force, the second to sweeten and embellish the lot of the oppressed with empty promises of a heavenly kingdom.","We set ourselves the ultimate aim of abolishing the state, i.e., all organized and systematic violence, all use of violence against people in general.","Capitalists are no more capable of self-sacrifice than a man is capable of lifting himself up by his own bootstraps.","It would be the greatest mistake, certainly, to think that concessions mean peace. Nothing of the kind. Concessions are nothing but a new form of war.","Man\u2019s consciousness not only reflects the objective world, but creates it.","War cannot be abolished unless classes are abolished.","People always have been the foolish victims of deception and self-deception in politics, and they always will be, until they have learned to seek out the interests of some class or other behind all moral, religious, political and social phrases, declarations and promises.","The constitution of Soviet Russia must insure equal rights for all citizens regardless of sex, creed, race, or nationality.","All our lives we fought against exalting the individual, against the elevation of the single person, and long ago we were over and done with the business of a hero, and here it comes up again: the glorification of one personality. This is not good at all.","The political form of a society wherein the proletariat is victorious in overthrowing the bourgeoisie will be a democratic republic.","Sometimes - history needs a push.","Be as radical as Reality.","Attention, must be devoted principally to raising the workers to the level of revolutionaries; it is not our task to descend to the level of the \'working masses\'.","When a liberal is abused, he says, \u2018Thank God they didn\u2019t beat me.\u2019 When he\\nis beaten, he thanks God they didn\u2019t kill him. When he is killed, he will thank God that his immortal soul has been delivered from its mortal clay.","Comrade Stalin, having become Secretary-General, has unlimited authority concentrated in his hands, and I am not sure whether he will always be capable of using that authority with sufficient caution.","Perfect definition of atheist dogma. Your mind has been subjected to subtle mental conditioning year after year. Now the atheist lie has become the truth to you. A lie that can be blown away with the real truth. It just takes time to unwind the atheist mental conditioning. The truth is out there. Outside of atheist dogma lies the truth!","Literature must become party literature. Down with unpartisan litterateurs! Down with the superman of literature! Literature must become a part of the general cause of the proletariat.","The Marxist doctrine is omnipotent because it is true. It is comprehensive and harmonious, and provides men with an integral world outlook irreconcilable with any form of superstition, reaction, or defence of bourgeois oppression. It is the legitimate successor to the best that man produced in the nineteenth century, as represented by German philosophy, English political economy and French socialism.","Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement.","Hang (hang without fail, so the people see) no fewer than one hundred known kulaks, rich men, bloodsuckers.","Crime is a product of social excess.","It is essential to grasp the incontestable truth that a Marxist must take cognisance of real life, of the true facts of reality, and not cling to a theory of yesterday, which, like all theories, at best only outlines the main and the general, only comes near to embracing life in all its complexity.","When one makes a Revolution, one cannot mark time; one must always go forward - or go back. He who now talks about the \'freedom of the press\' goes backward, and halts our headlong course towards Socialism.","Russians are too kind, they lack the ability to apply determined methods of revolutionary terror.","In the end, one or the other will triumph - a funeral dirge will be sung over the Soviet republic or over world capitalism.","Can a nation be free if it oppresses other nations? It cannot.","Bourgeois democracy is democracy of pompous phrases, solemn words, exuberant promises and the high-sounding slogans of freedom and equality. But, in fact, it screens the non-freedom and inferiority of women, the non-freedom and inferiority of the toilers and exploited.","We shall not achieve socialism without a struggle.","A revolution is impossible without a revolutionary situation; furthermore, not every revolutionary situation leads to revolution.","The Jewish bourgeoisie are our enemies, not as Jews but as bourgeoisie. The Jewish worker is our brother.","False rhetoric and false boastfulness spell moral ruin and lead unfailingly to political extinction.","I come to the categorical conclusion that precisely at this moment we must give battle to the Black Hundred clergy in the most decisive and merciless manner and crush its resistance with\\nsuch brutality that it will not forget it for decades to come. The greater the number of representatives of the reactionary clergy and reactionary bourgeoisie we succeed in executing for\\nthis reason, the better.","You all know that even when women have full rights, they still remain fatally downtrodden because all housework is left to them. In most cases housework is the most unproductive, the most barbarous and the most arduous work a woman can do. It is exceptionally petty and does not include anything that would in any way promote the development of the woman.","You have read and heard that communist theory-the science of communism created in the main by Marx, this doctrine of Marxism-has ceased to be the work of a single socialist of the nineteenth century, even though he was a genius, and that it has become the doctrine of millions and tens of millions of proletarians all over the world, who are applying it in their struggle against capitalism.","Imperialism is capitalism at that stage of development at which the dominance of monopolies and finance capitalism is established; in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance; in which the division of the world among the international trusts has begun, in which the division of all territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers has been completed.","The nearer we come to the full military suppression of the bourgeoisie, the more dangerous becomes to us the high flood of petty-bourgeois Anarchism. And the struggle against these elements cannot be waged with propaganda and agitation alone. ... The struggle must also be waged by applying force and compulsion.","Sometimes quantity has a quality all its own.","It is impossible to predict the time and progress of revolution. It is governed by its own more or less mysterious laws.","We are not utopians, we do not \u201cdream\u201d of dispensing at once with all administration, with all subordination. These anarchist dreams, based upon incomprehension of the tasks of the proletarian dictatorship, are totally alien to Marxism, and, as a matter of fact, serve only to postpone the socialist revolution until people are different. No, we want the socialist revolution with people as they are now, with people who cannot dispense with subordination, control, and \\"foremen and accountants\\".","I must say that the tasks of the youth in general, and of the Young Communist Leagues and all other organisations in particular, might be summed up in a single word: learn.","Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country.","Face the truth squarely. In politics that is always the best and the only correct attitude.","The most important thing when ill is to never lose heart.","Unity must be won, and only the workers, the class-conscious workers themselves can win it - by stubborn and persistent effort.","It is not difficult to be a revolutionary when revolution has already broken out and is in spate, when all people are joining the revolution just because they are carried away, because it is the vogue, and sometimes even from careerist motives. It is far more difficult--and far more precious--to be a revolutionary when the conditions for direct, open, really mass and really revolutionary struggle do not yet exist.","For the first time the peasant has seen real freedom - freedom to eat his bread, freedom from starvation.","Our aim is to achieve a socialist system of society, which, by eliminating the division of mankind into classes, by eliminating all exploitation of man by man and nation by nation, will inevitably eliminate the very possibility of war.","A country of inveterate, backwoods, thick-headed, egotistic philistines","A party is the vanguard of a class, and its duty is to lead the masses and not merely to reflect the average political level of the masses.","The leaders of the petty bourgeoisie must teach the people to trust the bourgeoisie. The proletarians must teach the people to distrust the bourgeoisie.","Capitalism has triumphed all over the world, but this triumph is only the prelude to the triumph of labour over capital.","Under socialism all will govern in turn and will soon become accustomed to no one governing.","Human reason has discovered many amazing things in nature and will discover still more, and will thereby increase its power over nature.","Where and when have riots and anarchy been provoked by wise measures? If the government had acted wisely, and if their measures had met the needs of the poor peasants, would there have been unrest among the peasant masses?","Capital, created by the labour of the worker, crushes the worker, ruining small proprietors and creating an army of unemployed.","Any army which does not train to use all the weapons, all the means and methods of warfare that the enemy possesses, or may possess, is behaving in an unwise or even criminal manner. This applies to politics even more than it does to the art of war.","For the complete extinction of the state, complete Communism is necessary.","Bah, tombstones are only good for pigeons to sit on","Peace, Land, and Bread! All power to the Soviet!","Political institutions are a superstructure resting on an economic foundation.","The majority of the so-called great powers have long been exploiting and enslaving a whole series of small and weak peoples. And the imperialist war is nothing other than a war for the division and redivision of this kind of booty.","No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself.","It is more pleasant and useful to go through the \'experience of the revolution\' than to write about it.","Socialists cannot achieve their great aim without fighting against all oppression of nations.","Imperialism, in a sense, is the transition stage from capitalism to Socialism. . . . It is capitalism dying, not dead.","One must not count in thousands, like the propagandist belonging to a small group that has not yet given leadership to the masses; in these circumstances one must count in millions and tens of millions.","Where the bourgeois economists saw a relation between things (the exchange of one commodity for another) Marx revealed a relation between people.","It is in prison ... that one becomes a real revolutionary.","The reflection of nature in man\'s thought must be understood not lifelessly but in the eternal process of movement, the arising of contradictions and their solution.","All contemporary religions and churches, all and every kind of religious organization, Marxism has always viewed as organs of bourgeois reaction, serving as a defense of exploitation and the doping of the working-classes.","All extremes are bad. All that is good and useful, if carried to extremes, may become-and beyond a certain limit is bound to become-bad and injurious.","The war is relentless: it puts the alternative in a ruthless relief.","To picture world history as advancing smoothly and steadily without sometimes taking gigantic strides backward is undialectical, unscientific and theoretically wrong.","To accept anything on trust, to preclude critical application and development, is a grievous sin.","The state does not function as we desired. A man is at the wheel and seems to lead it, but the car does not drive in the desired direction. It moves as another force wishes.","Victory will belong only to those who have faith in the people, those who are immersed in the life-giving spring of popular creativity.","Hundreds of thousands and millions of wage slaves of capital and peasants downtrodden by the serf-owners are going to the slaughter for the dynastic interests of a handful of crowned brigands, for the profits of the bourgeoisie in its drive to plunder foreign lands.","The most important thing is to know how to awaken in the still undeveloped masses an intelligent attitude towards religious questions and an intelligent criticism of religions.","Chess is only a recreation and not an occupation.","In capitalist society we have a democracy that is curtailed, wretched, false, a democracy only for the rich, for the minority. The dictatorship of the proletariat, the period of transition to communism, will for the first time create democracy for the people, for the majority, along with the necessary suppression of the exploiters, of the minority.","The whole struggle of our Party (and of the working class movement in Europe generally) must be directed against opportunism. The latter is not a current of opinion, not a tendency; it (opportunism) has now become the organised tool of the bourgeoisie within the working class movement.","When one makes a Revolution, one cannot mark time; one must always go forward--or go back","To rely upon conviction, devotion, and other excellent spiritual qualities; that is not to be taken seriously in politics.","If democracy, in essence, means the abolition of class domination, then why should not a socialist minister charm the whole bourgeois world by orations on class collaboration?","One would like to stroke and caress human beings, but one dares not do so, because they bite.","Act with the greatest determination and on the offensive. The defensive is the death of every armed rising.","But suppose, for the sake of argument, free competition, without any sort of monopoly, would develop capitalism trade more rapidly. Is it not a fact that the more rapidly trade and capitalism develop, the greater is the concentration of production and capital which gives rise to monopoly?","The Bolsheviks could not have retained power for two and a half months, let alone two and a half years, without the most rigorous and truly iron discipline in our Party.","If Socialism can only be realized when the intellectual development of all the people permits it, then we shall not see Socialism for at least five hundred years.","Democracy is a form of the state, it represents, on the one hand, the organized, systematic use of force against persons; but, on the other hand, it signifies the formal recognition of equality of citizens, the equal right of all to determine the structure of, and to administer, the state.","To decide once every few years which members of the ruling class is to repress and crush the people through parliament-this is the real essence of bourgeois parliamentarism, not only in parliamentary- constitutional monarchies, but also in the most democratic republics.","Behind the October Revolution there are more influential personalities than the thinkers and executors of Marxism.","When a war is waged by two opposing groups of robbers for the sake of deciding who shall have a freer hand to oppress more people, then the question of the origin of the war is of no real economic or political significance.","Whoever wants to reach socialism by any other path than that of political democracy will inevitably arrive at conclusions that are absurd and reactionary both in the economic and the political sense.","Lenin, the greatest man of action in our century and at the same time the most selfless.","Imperialism: The final stage of Capitalism.","We shall not bind ourselves by treaties. We shall not allow ourselves to be entangled by treaties. We reject all clauses on plunder and violence, but we shall welcome all clauses containing provisions for good-neighbourly relations and all economic agreements; we cannot reject these.","The status of women up to now has been compared to that of a slave; women have been tied to the home, and only socialism can save them from this. They will only be completely emancipated when we change from small-scale individual farming to collective farming and collective working of the land.","No Bolshevik, no Communist, no intelligent socialist has ever entertained the idea of violence against the middle peasants. All socialists have always spoken of agreement with them and of\\n their gradual and voluntary transition to socialism.","A political leader who desires to be useful to the revolutionary proletariat must be able to distinguish concrete cases of compromises that are inexcusable and are an expression of opportunism and treachery.","When we are victorious on a world scale I think we shall use gold for the purpose of building public lavatories in the streets of some of the largest cities of the world.","Politics is the most concentrated expression of economics.","International unity of the workers is more important than the national.","The progressive historical role of capitalism may be summed up in two brief propositions: increase in the productive forces of social labour, and the socialisation of that labour. But both these facts manifest themselves in extremely diverse processes in different branches of the national economy.","The government is tottering. We must deal it the death blow an any cost. To delay action is the same as death.","Let the \\"socialist\\" snivellers croak, let the bourgeoisie rage and fume, but only people who shut their eyes so as not to see, and stuff their ears so as not to hear, can fail to notice that all over the world the birth pangs of the old, capitalist society, which is pregnant with socialism, have begun.","Every cook has to learn how to govern the state.","When we say \\"the state,\\" the state is We, it is we, it is the proletariat, it is the advanced guard of the working class.","Ideological talk and phrase mongering about political liberties should be disposed with; all that is just mere chatter and phrase mongering. We should get away from those phrases.","The bourgeoisie incites the workers of one nation against those of another in the endeavour to keep them disunited.","An end to wars, peace among the nations, the cessation of pillaging and violence - such is our ideal, but only bourgeois sophists can seduce the masses with this ideal, if the latter is divorced from a direct and immediate call for revolutionary action.","Materialism is the recognition of \\"objects in themselves\\", or outside the mind; ideas and sensations are copies of images of those objects.","If it were necessary to give the briefest possible definition of imperialism, we should have to say that imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism.","Unity is a great thing and a great slogan. But what the workers\u2019 cause needs is the unity of Marxists, not unity between Marxists, and opponents and distorters of Marxism.","Human knowledge is not (or does not follow) a straight line, but a curve, which endlessly approximates a series of circles, a spiral. Any fragment, segment, section of this curve can be transformed (transformed one-sidedly) into an independent, complete, straight line, which then (if one does not see the wood for the trees) leads into the quagmire, into clerical obscurantism (where it is anchored by the class interests of the ruling classes).","Revolution can never be forecast; it cannot be foretold; it comes of itself. Revolution is brewing and is bound to flare up.","Without a revolutionary theory there cannot be a revolutionary movement.","The most important thing in illness is never to lose heart.","Our idea is that a state is strong when the people are politically conscious. It is strong when the people know everything, can form an opinion of everything, and do everything consciously.","Human thought by its nature is capable of giving, and does give, absolute truth, which is compounded of a sum-total of relative truths.","You cannot do anything without rousing the masses to action.","All official and liberal science defends wage-slavery, whereas Marxism has declared relentless war on that slavery.","This fear of criticism displayed by the advocates of freedom of criticism cannot be attributed solely to craftiness. No, the majority of the Economists look with sincere resentment upon all theoretical controversies, factional disagreements, broad political questions, plans for organising revolutionaries, etc.","It is stupid to tolerate Nikola; all Chekists have to be on alert to shoot anyone who doesn\'t turn up to work because of Nikola.","All countries will inevitably have to do what Russia has done.","It is not for nothing that Skaldin in one part of his book quotes Adam Smith: we have seen that both his views and the character of his arguments in many respects repeat the theses of that\\ngreat ideologist of the progressive bourgeoisie.","The natural scientist must be a modern materialist, a conscious adherent of the materialism represented by Marx, i.e., he must be a dialectical materialist.","The war is relentless: it puts the alternative in a ruthless relief: either to perish, or to catch up with the advanced countries and outdistance them, too, in economic matters.","History causes the military problem to become the essence of the political problem.","Politics begin where the masses are, not where there are thousands, but where there are millions, that is where serious politics begin.","The entire trend of development is towards abolition of coercive domination of one part of society over another.","We must follow the rule: Better fewer, but better. We must follow the rule: Better get good human material in two or even three years than work in haste without hope of getting any at all.","Behind the epistemological scholasticism of empirio-criticism one must not fail to see the struggle of parties in philosophy, a struggle which in the last analysis reflects the tendencies and ideology of the antagonistic classes in modern society.","Does not the whole history of socialism, particularly of French socialism, which is so rich in revolutionary striving, show us that when the working people themselves take power in their hands the ruling classes resort to unheard-of crimes and shootings if it is a matter of protecting their money-bags.","Recovery proceeding excellently. Am sure that the crushing of the Kazan Czechs and whiteguards, as well as of the kulak extortioners supporting them, will be exemplarily ruthless.","The history of all countries shows that the working class exclusively by its own effort is able to develop only trade-union consciousness.","Every cook must learn to rule the State.","The sole \\"property\\" of matter with whose recognition philosophical materialism is bound up is the property of being an objective reality, of existing outside the mind.","The working class must break up, smash the \\"ready-made state machinery,\\" and not confine itself merely to laying hold of it.","Those who are really convinced that they have made progress in science would not demand freedom for the new views to continue side by side with the old, but the substitution of the new views for the old.","For any truth, if \u201coverdone\u201d (as Dietzgen Senior put it), if exaggerated, or if carried beyond the limits of its actual applicability, can be reduced to an absurdity, and is even bound to become an absurdity under these conditions.","In the last analysis, productivity of labour is the most important, the principal thing for the victory of the new social system.","It is at moments of need that one learns who one\'s friends are. Defeated armies learn their lesson.","Every question \\"runs in a vicious circle\\" because political life as a whole is an endless chain consisting of an infinite number of links.

Production becomes social, but appropriation remains private. The social means of production remain the private property of a few. The general framework of formally recognised free competition remains, and the yoke of a few monopolists on the rest of the population becomes a hundred times heavier, more burdensome and intolerable.","The task of a truly revolutionary party is not to declare that it is impossible to renounce all compromises, but to be able, through all compromises, when they are unavoidable, to remain true to its principles, to its class, to its revolutionary purpose, to its task of paving the way for revolution and educating the mass of the people for victory in the revolution.","When the workers of a single factory or of a single branch of industry engage in struggle against their employer or employers, is this class struggle? No, this is only a weak embryo of it. The struggle of the workers becomes a class struggle only when all the foremost representatives of the entire working class of the whole country are conscious of themselves as a single working class and launch a struggle that is directed, not against individual employers, but against the entire class of capitalists and against the government that supports that class. Only when the individual worker realizes that he is a member of the entire working class, only when he recognises the fact that his petty day-to-day struggle against individual employers and individual government officials is a struggle against the entire bourgeoisie and the entire government, does his struggle become a class struggle.","In capitalist society, providing it develops under the most favorable conditions, we have a more or less complete democracy in the democratic republic.

A development that seemingly repeats the stages already passed, but repeats them differently, on a higher basis (\u2018negation of negation\u2019), a development, so to speak, in a spiral, not in a straight line; a development by leaps, catastrophes and revolutions; \u2018breaks in continuity\u2019; the transformation of quantity into quality; inner impulses to development, imparted by the contradiction and conflict of the various forces and tendencies acting on a given body, or within a given phenomenon, or within a given society; the interdependence and the closest, indissoluble connection of all sides of every phenomenon (history constantly discloses ever new sides), a connection that provides a uniform, law governed, universal process of motion - such are some of the features of dialectics as a richer (than the ordinary) doctrine of development.","My cherished idea is a solution for the social problem, i.e., in order to save the 40,000,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom from a bloody civil war, we colonial statesmen must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new markets for the goods produced in the factories and mines.

Would the Paris Commune have lasted more than a day if it had not used the authority of the armed people against the bourgeoisie?

Only when the \\"lower classes\\" do not want the old way, and when the \\"upper classes\\" cannot carry on in the old way \u2013 only then can revolution triumph. This truth may be expressed in other words: revolution is impossible without a nationwide crisis (affecting both the exploited and the exploiters). It follows that revolution requires, first, that a majority of the workers (or at least a majority of the class-conscious, thinking and politically active workers) should fully understand that revolution is necessary and be ready to sacrifice their lives for it; second, that the ruling classes should be passing through a governmental crisis which draws even the most backward masses into politics (a symptom of every real revolution is a rapid tenfold and even hundredfold increase in the number of representatives of the toiling and oppressed masses - hitherto apathetic \u2013 who are capable of waging the political struggle), weakens the government and make it possible for the revolutionaries to overthrow it rapidly.","In reality the state is nothing but a machine for the oppression of one class by another, and indeed in the democratic republic no less than in the monarchy.","Socialists have always condemned war between nations as barbarous and brutal. But our attitude towards war is fundamentally different from that of the bourgeois pacifists (supporters and advocates of peace) and of the Anarchists. We differ from the former in that we understand the inevitable connection between wars and the class struggle within the country; we understand that war cannot be abolished unless classes are abolished and Socialism is created; and we also differ in that we fully regard civil wars, i.e., wars waged by the oppressed class against the oppressing class, slaves against slave-owners, serfs against land-owners, and wage workers against the bourgeoisie, as legitimate, progressive and necessary. We Marxists differ from both the pacifists and the Anarchists in that we deem it necessary historically (from the standpoint of Marx\'s dialectical materialism) to study each war separately. In history there have been numerous wars which, in spite of all the horrors, atrocities, distress and suffering that inevitably accompany all wars, were progressive, i.e., benefited the development of mankind by helping to destroy the exceptionally harmful and reactionary institutions (for example, autocracy or serfdom), the most barbarous despotisms in Europe (Turkish and Russian). Therefore, it is necessary to examine the historically specific features of precisely the present war.","Notwithstanding all the laws emancipating woman, she continues to be a domestic slave, because petty housework crushes, strangles, stultifies and degrades her, chains her to the kitchen and the nursery, and she wastes her labour on barbarously unproductive, petty, nerve\u2011racking, stultifying and crushing drudgery.","Crises of every kind \u2014 economic crises more frequently, but not only these \u2014 in their turn increase very considerably the tendency towards concentration and monopoly.","Parliamentarism, of course, is \u201cpolitically obsolete for the Communists in Germany; but\u2014and that is the whole point\u2014we must not regard what is obsolete for us as being obsolete for the class, as being obsolete for the masses. Here again we find that the \u201cLefts\u201d do not know how to reason, do not know how to act as the party of the class, as the party of the masses. You must not sink to the level of the masses, to the level of the backward strata of the class. That is incontestable. You must tell them the bitter truth. You must call their bourgeois democratic and parliamentary prejudices prejudices. But at the same time you must soberly follow the actual state of class consciousness and preparedness of the whole class (not only of its Communist vanguard), of all the toiling masses (not only of their advanced elements).\u201d","To refuse to work in the reactionary trade unions means leaving the insufficiently developed or backward masses of workers under the influence of the reactionary leaders, the agents of the bourgeoisie, the labor aristocrats, or the \u201cworkers who have become completely bourgeois.\u201d","[If] we were to make \u201crecognition of the dictatorship [of the proletariat] a condition of trade union membership, we should be committing a folly, we should be damaging our influence over the masses, we should be helping the Mensheviks. For the whole task of the Communists is to be able to convince the backward elements, to work among them, and not to fence themselves off from them\u2026\u201d","Under capitalism democratism is restricted, cramped, curtailed, mutilated by all the conditions of wage slavery and of the poverty and misery of the masses. This and this alone is the reason why the office-holders in our political organizations and trade unions are corrupted (or, more precisely, have a tendency to be corrupted) by the conditions of capitalism and betray a tendency to being turned into bureaucrats, i.e. privileged persons cut off from the masses and standing above the masses","... I want with my vote to support Henderson in the same way as the rope supports a hanged man.","we shall move on to a break with these traitors to socialism and shall fight for the complete destruction of the old state machine in order that the armed proletariat itself should become the government.","The distortion and shelving of the question of the relation of the proletarian revolution to the state could not help but play an immense role at a time when states, each with its military apparatus reinforced as a result of imperialist competition, have been turned into military monsters which are exterminating millions of people in order to decide the dispute as to whether England or Germany \u2013 this or that centre of finance capital \u2013 is to rule the world.","The replacement of the bourgeois state by the proletarian state is impossible without a violent revolution. The eradication of the proletarian state, i.e. the eradication of the state as such, is impossible except through the process of \u2018withering away\u2019.","Rusya\'da, hem 1870\'li, hem de 1860\'l\u0131 y\u0131llarda (hatta 19. y\xfczy\u0131l\u0131n ilk yar\u0131s\u0131nda) da grevler oldu ve bunlar makinelerin vb. \\"kendili\u011finden\\" tahrip edilmesi vb. e\u015fli\u011finde ya\u015fanan grevlerdi.
