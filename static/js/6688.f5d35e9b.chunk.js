To him, the walls of his prison are invisible, and he believes himself to be free.","The deepest sin against the human mind is to believe things without evidence.","Medical science has made such tremendous progress that there is hardly a healthy human left.","Never have so many been manipulated so much by so few.","The surest way to work up a crusade in favor of some good cause is to promise people they will have a chance of maltreating someone. To be able to destroy with good conscience, to be able to behave badly and call your bad behavior \'righteous indignation\' \u2014 this is the height of psychological luxury, the most delicious of moral treats.","Reality cannot be ignored except at a price; and the longer the ignorance is persisted in, the higher and more terrible becomes the price that must be paid.","It\'s dark because you are trying too hard. Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly. Yes, feel lightly even though you\'re feeling deeply. Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them. So throw away your baggage and go forward. There are quicksands all about you, sucking at your feet, trying to suck you down into fear and self-pity and despair. That\'s why you must walk so lightly. Lightly my darling.","... the greater part of the population is not very intelligent, dreads responsibility, and desires nothing better than to be told what to do. Provided the rulers do not interfere with its material comforts and its cherished beliefs, it is perfectly happy to let itself be ruled.","Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.","Experience is not what happens to you; it\'s what you do with what happens to you.","There is only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that\'s your own self.","This Power Elite directly employs several millions of the country\xb4s working force in its factories, offices and stores, controls many millions more by lending them the money to buy its products, and, through its ownership of the media of mass communication, influences the thoughts, the feelings and the actions of virtually everybody. To parody the words of W. Churchill, never have so many been manipulated so much by few.","The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does. They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society.","The propagandist\'s purpose is to make one set of people forget that certain other sets of people are human.","Love casts out fear; but conversely fear casts out love. And not only love. Fear also casts out intelligence, casts out goodness, casts out all thought of beauty and truth.","The older dictators fell because they could never supply their subjects with enough bread, enough circuses, enough miracles, and mysteries. Under a scientific dictatorship, education will really work\' with the result that most men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution. There seems to be no good reason why a thoroughly scientific dictatorship should ever be overthrown.","Hitler\'s vast propaganda successes were accomplished with little more than the radio and loudspeaker, and without TV and tape and video recording . . . Today the art of mind control is in the process of becoming a science.","People often ask me what is the most effective technique for transforming their life. It is a little embarrassing that after years and years of research and experimentation, I have to say that the best answer is - just be a little kinder.","Liberties are not given, they are taken.","Most ignorance is vincible ignorance. We don\'t know because we don\'t want to know.","That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history.","Dictators can always consolidate their tyranny by an appeal to patriotism.","Democracy can hardly be expected to flourish in societies where political and economic power is being progressively concentrated and centralized. But the progress of technology has led and is still leading to just such a concentration and centralization of power.","The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age, which mean never losing your enthusiasm.","A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude.","A child-like man is not a man whose development has been arrested; on the contrary, he is a man who has given himself a chance of continuing to develop long after most adults have muffled themselves in the cocoon of middle-aged habit and convention.","The most valuable of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it has to be done, whether you like it or not.","Assemble a mob of men and women previously conditioned by a daily reading of the newspapers; treat them to amplified band music, bright lights...and in next to no time you can reduce them to a state of almost mindless subhumanity. Never before have so few been in a position to make fools, maniacs, or criminals of so many.","Everyone who wants to do good to the human race always ends in universal bullying.","In regard to propaganda the early advocates of universal literacy and a free press envisaged only two possibilities: the propaganda might be true, or the propaganda might be false. They did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in our Western capitalist democracies - the development of a vast mass communications industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take into account man\'s almost infinite appetite for distractions.","Medical science is making such remarkable progress that soon none of us will be well.","One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.","Armaments, universal debt and planned obsolescence - those are the three pillars of Western prosperity.","If most of us remain ignorant of ourselves, it is because self-knowledge is painful and we prefer the pleasures of illusion.","Beware of being too rational. In the country of the insane, the integrated man doesn\'t become king. He gets lynched.","Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards.","An intellectual is a person who\'s found one thing that\'s more interesting than sex.","This concern with the basic condition of freedom -- the absence of physical constraint -- is unquestionably necessary, but is not all that is necessary. It is perfectly possible for a man to be out of prison and yet not free -- to be under no physical constraint and yet to be a psychological captive, compelled to think, feel and act as the representatives of the national State, or of some private interest within the nation, want him to think, feel and act.","Wherever the choice has had to be made between the man of reason and the madman, the world has unhesitatingly followed the madman.","The question of the next generation will not be one of how to liberate the masses, but rather, how to make them love their servitude.","The more powerful and original a mind, the more it will incline towards the religion of solitude.","Human beings act in a great variety of irrational ways, but all of them seem to be capable, if given a fair chance, of making a reasonable choice in the light of available evidence. Democratic institutions can be made to work only if all concerned do their best to impart knowledge and to encourage rationality. But today, in the world\'s most powerful democracy, the politicians and the propagandists prefer to make nonsense of democratic procedures by appealing almost exclusively to the ignorance and irrationality of the electors.","There is only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that is your own self. So you have to begin there, not outside, not on other people. That comes afterwards, when you have worked on your own corner.","Every ceiling reached becomes a floor.","As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom tends correspondingly to increase. And the dictator will do well to encourage that freedom...it will help to reconcile his subjects to the servitude which is their fate.","Addiction is an increasing desire for an act that gives less and less satisfaction","The goal in life is to discover that you\u2019ve always been where you were supposed to be.","Experience teaches only the teachable.","Higher education is not necessarily a guarantee of higher virtue.","An unexciting truth may be eclipsed by a thrilling lie.","You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you mad.","Within the next generation I believe that the world\'s leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.","We shall be permitted to live on this planet only for as long as we treat all nature with compassion and intelligence.","Assembled in a crowd, people lose their powers of reasoning and their capacity for moral choice.","If we evolved a race of Isaac Newtons, that would not be progress. For the price Newton had to pay for being a supreme intellect was that he was incapable of friendship, love, fatherhood, and many other desirable things. As a man he was a failure; as a monster he was superb.","Great is truth, but still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth. By simply not mentioning certain subjects... totalitarian propagandists have influenced opinion much more effectively than they could have by the most eloquent denunciations.","which is better - to be born stupid into an intelligent society or intelligent into an insane one?","The people who kill and torture and tell lies in the name of their sacred causes, these are never the publicans and the sinners. No, they\'re the virtuous, respectable men, who have the finest feelings, the best brains, the noblest ideals.","Children are nowhere taught, in any systematic way, to distinguish true from false, or meaningful from meaningless, statements. Why is this so? Because their elders, even in the democratic countries, do not want them to be given this kind of education.","All that is needed is money and a candidate who can be coached to look sincere. Political principles and plans for specific action have come to lose most of their importance. The personality of the candidate, the way he is projected by the advertising experts, are the things that really matter.","Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted.","It\'s a little embarrassing that after 45 years of research & study, the best advice I can give people is to be a little kinder to each other.","Beauty is worse than wine, it intoxicates both the holder and beholder.","The spiritual journey does not consist of arriving at a new destination where a person gains what he did not have, or becomes what he is not. It consists in the dissipation of one\'s own ignorance concerning oneself and life, and the gradual growth of that understanding which begins the spiritual awakening. The finding of God is a coming to one?s self.","What I may call the messages of Brave New World, but it is possible to make people contented with their servitude. I think this can be done. I think it has been done in the past. I think it could be done even more effectively now because you can provide them with bread and circuses and you can provide them with endless amounts of distractions and propaganda.","The more you know, the more you see","The Bhagavad-Gita is the most systematic statement of spiritual evolution of endowing value to mankind. It is one of the most clear and comprehensive summaries of perennial philosophy ever revealed; hence its enduring value is subject not only to India but to all of humanity.","Don\'t try to behave as though you were essentially sane and naturally good. We\'re all demented sinners in the same cosmic boat - and the boat is perpetually sinking.","If human beings were shown what they\'re really like, they\'d either kill one another as vermin, or hang themselves.","The greatest triumphs of propoganda have been accomplished, not by doing something, but by refraining from doing. Great is truth, but still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth.","After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.","Thanks to words, we have been able to rise above the brutes; and thanks to words, we have often sunk to the level of the demons.","But the nature of the universe is such that ends can never justify means. On the contrary, the means always determine the end.","Liberty? Why it doesn\'t exist. There is no liberty in this world, just gilded cages.","Our business is to wake up. We have to find ways in which to detect the whole of reality in the one illusory part which our self-centered consciousness permits us to see. We must not live thoughtlessly, taking our illusion for the complete reality, but at the same time we must not live too thoughtfully in the sense of trying to escape from the dream state. We must be continuously on watch for ways in which we may enlarge our consciousness.","The world is an illusion, but an illusion which we must take seriously.","My father considered a walk among the mountains as the equivalent of churchgoing.","If one\'s different, one\'s bound to be lonely.","The most shocking fact about war is that its victims and its instruments are individual human beings, and that these individual beings are condemned by the monstrous conventions of politics to murder or be murdered in quarrels not their own.","Man is unique in organizing the mass murder of his own species.","Never give children a chance of imagining that anything exists in isolation. Make it plain from the very beginning that all living is relationship. Show them relationships in the woods, in the fields, in the ponds and streams, in the village and in the country around it. Rub it in.","People intoxicate themselves with work so they won\'t see how they really are.","To be a fool at the right time is also an art.","All that happens means something; nothing you do is ever insignificant.","Consistency is contrary to nature, contrary to life. The only completely consistent people are dead.","You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. . . . Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies. Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat\'s meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, quite intelligent enough.","The third petition of the Lord\'s Prayer is repeated daily by millions who have not the slightest intention of letting anyone\'s will be done but their own.","So long as men worship the Caesars and Napoleons, Caesars and Napoleons will duly arise and make them miserable.","Chronic remorse, as all the moralists are agreed, is a most undesirable sentiment. If you have behaved badly, repent, make what amends you can and address yourself to the task of behaving better next time. On no account brood over your wrongdoing. Rolling in the muck is not the best way of getting clean.","I wanted to change the world. But I have found that the only thing one can be sure of changing is oneself.","No social stability without individual stability.","life is short and information endless: nobody has time for everything","A mind that has come to the stillness of wisdom shall know being, shall know what it is to love. Love is neither personal nor impersonal. Love is love, not to be defined or described by the mind as exclusive or inclusive. Love is its own eternity; it is the real, the supreme, the immeasurable.","Words can be like X-rays if you use them properly -- they\u2019ll go through anything. You read and you\u2019re pierced.","Man is hypnotized by the glitter of his own gadgetry","It isn\'t a matter of forgetting. What one has to learn is how to remember and yet be free of the past.","The trouble with fiction,\\" said John Rivers, \\"is that it makes too much sense. Reality never makes sense.","To be well informed, one must read quickly a great number of merely instructive books. To be cultivated, one must read slowly and with a lingering appreciation the comparatively few books that have been written by men who lived, thought, and felt with style.","In spite of language, in spite of intelligence and intuition and sympathy, one can never really communicate anything to anybody. The essential substance of every thought and feeling remains incommunicable, locked up in the impenetrable strong-room of the individual soul and body. Our life is a sentence of perpetual solitary confinement.","If you don\'t gamble, you\'ll never win.","The consistent thinker, the consistently moral man, is either a walking mummy or else, if he has not succeeded in stifling all his vitality, a fanatical monomaniac.","The pleasures of ignorance are as great, in their way, as the pleasures of knowledge.","A majority of young people seem to develop mental arteriosclerosis forty years before they get the physical kind.","The worst enemy of life, freedom and the common decencies is total anarchy; their second worst enemy is total efficiency.","By comparison with a night-club, churches are positively gay.","The nature of power is such that even those who have not sought it, but have had it forced upon them, tend to acquire a taste for more.","Hug me till you drug me, honey; Kiss me till I\'m in a coma.","For at least two thirds of our miseries spring from human stupidity, human malice and those great motivators and justifiers of malice and stupidity, idealism, dogmatism and proselytizing zeal on behalf of religious or political idols","Good is a product of the ethical and spiritual artistry of individuals; it cannot be mass-produced.","All war propaganda consists, in the last resort, in substituting diabolical abstractions for human beings. Similarly, those who defend war have invented a pleasant sounding vocabulary of abstractions in which to describe the process of mass murder.","Industrialization is the systemic exploitation of wasting assets. In all too many cases, the thing we call progress is merely an acceleration in the rate of that exploitation.","Single-mindedness is all very well in cows or baboons; in an animal claiming to belong to the same species as Shakespeare, it is simply disgraceful.","Liberty, as we all know, cannot flourish in a country that is permanently on a war footing, or even a near war footing. Permanent crisis justifies permanent control of everybody and everything by the agencies of central government.","In the course of evolution nature has gone to endless trouble to see that every individual is unlike every other individual....Physically and mentally, each one of us is unique. Any culture which, in the interests of efficiency or in the name of some political or religious dogma, seeks to standardize the human individual, commits an outrage against man\'s biological nature.","The survival of democracy depends on the ability of large numbers of people to make realistic choices in the light of adequate information.","Chastity - the most unnatural of all the sexual perversions.","Modern man no longer regards Nature as in any sense divine and feels perfectly free to behave toward her as an overweening conqueror and tyrant.","The effects which follow too constant and intense a concentration upon evil are always disastrous. Those who crusade, not for God in themselves, but against the devil in others, never succeed in making the world better, but leave it either as it was, or sometimes even perceptibly worse than it was, before the crusade began. By thinking primarily of evil we tend, however excellent our intentions, to create occasions for evil to manifest itself.","One seventh of your life is spent on Monday.","The silent bear no witness against themselves.","So now you can let go, my darling...Let go...Let go of this poor old body. You don\'t need it anymore. Let it fall away from you. Leave it lying there like a pile of worn-out clothes...Go on, my darling, go on into the Light, into the peace, into the living peace of the Clear Light.","In all activities of life, the secret of efficiency lies in an ability to combine two seemingly incompatible states: a state of maximum activity and a state of maximum relaxation.","Did you ever feel, as though you had something inside you that was only waiting for you to give it a chance to come out? Some sort of extra power that you aren\'t using - you know, like all the water that goes down the falls instead of through the turbines?","All gods are homemade, and it is we who pull their strings, and so, give them the power to pull ours.","If only people would realize that moral principles are like measles.... They have to be caught. And only the people who\'ve got them can pass on the contagion.","Most ignorances are vincible, and in the greater number of cases stupidity is what the Buddha pronounced it to be, a sin. For, consciously, or subconsciously, it is with deliberation that we do not know or fail to understand-because incomprehension allows us, with a good conscience, to evade unpleasant obligations and responsibilities, because ignorance is the best excuse for going on doing what one likes, but ought not, to do.","The present moment is the only aperture through which the soul can pass out of time into eternity, through which grace can pass out of eternity into the soul, and through which love can pass from one soul in time to another soul in time.","To travel is to discover that everyone is wrong about other countries.","The Perennial Philosophy is expressed most succinctly in the Sanskrit formula, tat tvam asi (\'That art thou\'); the Atman, or immanent eternal Self, is one with Brahman, the Absolute Principle of all existence; and the last end of every human being, is to discover the fact for himself, to find out who he really is.","Did you eat something that didn\'t agree with you?\\" asked Bernard. The Savage nodded \\"I ate civilization.","Every man\'s memory is his private literature.","We can only love what we know, and we can never know completely what we do not love. Love is a mode of knowledge","On no account brood over your wrongdoing. Rolling in the muck is not the best way of getting clean.","I had motives for not wanting the world to have meaning; consequently assumed that it had none, and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying reasons for this assumption ... For myself, as no doubt, for most of my contemporaries, the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation. The liberation we desired was simultaneous liberation from a certain political and economic system, and liberation from a certain system of morality. We objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom.","If one is not oneself a sage or saint, the best thing one can do is to study the words of those who were.","Universal education has created an immense class of what I may call the New Stupid, hungering for certainty yet unable to find it in the traditional myths and their rationalizations.","Round pegs in square holes tend to have dangerous thoughts about the social system and tend to infect others with their discontents.","Almost all of us long for peace and freedom; but very few of us have much enthusiasm for the thoughts, feelings, and actions that make for peace and freedom.","Every ceiling, when reached, becomes a floor, upon which one walks as a matter of course and prescriptive right","To his dog, every man is Napoleon; hence the constant popularity of dogs.","Hinduism the perennial philosophy that is at the core of all religions.","Give us this day our daily Faith, but deliver us, dear God, from Belief.","We are all geniuses up to the age of ten.","Every idol, however exalted, turns out, in the long run, to be a Moloch, hungry for human sacrifice.","At this very moment,... the most frightful horrors are taking place in every corner of the world. People are being crushed, slashed, disembowelled, mangled; their dead bodies rot and their eyes decay with the rest. Screams of pain and fear go pulsing through the air at the rate of eleven hundred feet per second. After travelling for three seconds they are perfectly inaudible. These are distressing facts; but do we enjoy life any the less because of them? Most certainly we do not.","There isn\'t any formula or method. You learn to love by loving - by paying attention and doing what one thereby discovers has to be done.","Armaments, universal debt, and planned obsolescence - those are the three pillars of Western prosperity. If war, waste, and moneylenders were abolished, you\'d collapse. And while you people are overconsuming the rest of the world sinks more and more deeply into chronic disaster.","In real life there is no such person as the average man.","Several excuses are always less convincing than one.","If you want to write, keep cats.","Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn\'t nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.","Nobody needs to go anywhere else. We are all, if we only knew it, already there. If I only knew who in fact I am, I should cease to behave as what I think I am; and if I stopped behaving as what I think I am, I should know who I am. What in fact I am, if only the Manichee I think I am would allow me to know it, is the reconciliation of yes and no lived out in total acceptance and the blessed experience of Not-Two. In religion all words are dirty words. Anybody who gets eloquent about Buddha, or God, or Christ, ought to have his mouth washed out with carbolic soap.","One third, more or less, of all the sorrow that the person I think I am must endure is unavoidable. It is the sorrow inherent in the human condition, the price we must pay for being sentient and self-conscious organisms, aspirants to liberation, but subject to the laws of nature and under orders to keep on marching, through irreversible time, through a world wholly indifferent to our well-being, toward decrepitude and the certainty of death. The remaining two thirds of all sorrow is homemade and, so far as the universe is concerned, unnecessary.","\\"Our kingdom go\\" is the necessary and unavoidable corollary of \'Thy kingdom come.\' For the more there is self, the less there is of God. The divine eternal fulness of life can be gained only by those who have deliberately lost the partial, separative life of craving and self-interest, of egocentric thinking, feeling, wishing, and acting.","If the Prince of Peace should come to earth, one of the first things he would do would be to put psychiatrists in their place.","Proverbs are always platitudes until you have personally experienced the truth of them.","Most of one\'s life is one prolonged effort to prevent oneself thinking.","We don\'t want to change. Every change is a menace to stability.","Dream in a pragmatic way.","There\'s only one effectively redemptive sacrifice, the sacrifice of self-will to make room for the knowledge of God.","A democracy which makes or even effectively prepares for modern, scientific war must necessarily cease to be democratic. No country can be really well prepared for modern war unless it is governed by a tyrant, at the head of a highly trained and perfectly obedient bureaucracy.","Science is not enough, religion is not enough, art is not enough, politics and economics are not enough, nor is love, nor is duty, nor is action however disinterested, nor, however sublime, is contemplation. Nothing short of everything, will really do.","At their first appearance innovators have always been derided as fools and mad men.","This growing poverty in the midst of growing population constitutes a permanent menace to peace. And not only to peace, but also to democratic institutions and personal liberty For overpopulation is not compatible with freedom.","Hell isn\'t merely paved with good intentions; it\'s walled and roofed with them. Yes, and furnished too.","Most men and women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best so monotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape, the longing to transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and has always been one of the principal appetites of the soul.","... one reads, above all, to prevent oneself thinking.","The fact that people are shocked is the best proof that they need shocking.","What is absurd and monstrous about war is that men who have no personal quarrel should be trained to murder one another in cold blood.","Children are remarkable for their intelligence and ardor, for their curiosity, their intolerance of shams, the clarity and ruthlessness of their vision.","For in spite of language, in spite of intelligence and intuition and sympathy, one can never really communicate anything to anybody.","We live together, we act on, and react to one another; but always, and in all circumstances, we are by ourselves.","We participate in a tragedy; at a comedy we only look.","The vast majority of human beings dislike and even actually dread all notions with which they are not familiar... Hence it comes about that at their first appearance innovators have generally been persecuted, and always derided as fools and madmen.","The thin and precarious crust of decency is all that separates any civilization, however impressive, from the hell of anarchy or systematic tyranny which lie in wait beneath the surface .","Words form the thread on which we string our experiences. [Therefore be careful how you interpret your life. Don\'t think or speak negatively lest your subconscious and others take you at your word and you are hung by your own tongue!]","We are so anxious to achieve some particular end that we never pay attention to the psycho-physical means whereby that end is to be gained. So far as we are concerned, any old means is good enough. But the nature of the universe is such that ends can never justify the means. On the contrary, the means always determine the end.","God isn\'t the son of Memory; He\'s the son of Immediate Experience. You can\'t worship a spirit in spirit, unless you do it now. Wallowing in the past may be good literature. As wisdom, it\'s hopeless. Time Regained is Paradise Lost, and Time Lost is Paradise Regained. Let the dead bury their dead. If you want to live at every moment as it presents itself, you\'ve got to die to every other moment.","No man ever dared to manifest his boredom so insolently as does a Siamese tomcat when he yawns in the face of his amorously importunate wife.","Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic tradition into which he has been born - the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to the accumulated records of other people\'s experience, the victim in so far as it confirms him in the belief that reduced awareness is the only awareness and as it bedevils his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his concepts for data, his words for actual things.","That\u2019s what the human brain is there for\u2014to turn the chaos of given experience into a set of manageable symbols. Sometimes the symbols correspond fairly closely to some of the aspects of the external reality behind our experience; then you have science and common sense. Sometimes, on the contrary, the symbols have almost no connection with external reality; then you have paranoia and delirium. More often there\u2019s a mixture, part realistic and part fantastic; that\u2019s religion.","It is only when we have renounced our preoccupation with \\"I,\\" \\"me,\\" \\"mine,\\" that we can truly possess the world in which we live. Everything, provided that we regard nothing as property. And not only is everything ours; it is also everybody else\'s.","All of us desire a better state of society. But society cannot become better before two great tasks are performed.Unless peace can be firmly established and the prevailing obsession with money and power profoundly modified, there is no hope of any desirable change being made.","One of the great attractions of patriotism - it fulfills our worst wishes. In the person of our nation we are able, vicariously, to bully and cheat. Bully and cheat, what\'s more, with a feeling that we are profoundly virtuous.","...two thirds of all sorrow is homemade and, so far as the universe is concerned, unnecessary.","Consciousness is only possible through change; change is only possible through movement.","To see ourselves as others see us is a most salutary gift. Hardly less important is the capacity to see others as they see themselves.","Ignore death up to the last moment; then, when it can\'t be ignored any longer, have yourself squirted full of morphia and shuffle off in a coma. Thoroughly sensible, humane and scientific, eh?","One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them. Finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons-that\'s philosophy. People believe in God because they\'ve been conditioned to believe in God.","If we must play the theological game, let us never forget that it is a game. Religion, it seems to me, can survive only as a consciously accepted system of make-believe.","The vast majority of human beings are not interested in reason or satisfied with what it teaches.","That all men are equal is a proposition to which, at ordinary times, no sane human being has ever given his assent.","Art is one of the means whereby man seeks to redeem a life which is experienced as chaotic, senseless, and largely evil.","...most men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution.","Pageantry is a visionary art which has been used, from time immemorial, as a political instrument.","Morality is always the product of terror; its chains and strait-waistcoats are fashioned by those who dare not trust others, because they dare not trust themselves, to walk in liberty.","I write everything many times over. All my thoughts are second thoughts.","The condition of being forgiven is self-abandonment. The proud man prefers self-reproach, however painful --because the reproached self isn\'t abandoned; it remains intact.","Complete prohibition of all chemical mind changers can be decreed, but cannot be enforced, and tends to create more evils than it cures.","The finest works of art are precious, among other reasons, because they make it possible for us to know, if only imperfectly and for a little while, what it actually feels like to think subtly and feel nobly.","Only a person with a Best Seller mind can write Best Sellers.","Facts are ventriloquist\u2019s dummies. Sitting on a wise man\u2019s knee they may be made to utter words of wisdom; elsewhere, they say nothing, or talk nonsense, or indulge in sheer diabolism.","In a few years, no doubt, marriage licences will be sold like dog licences, good for 12 months.","Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him. It is a gift for dealing with the accidents of existence, not the accidents themselves.","That we are not much sicker and much madder than we are is due exclusively to that most blessed and blessing of all natural graces, sleep.","Generalized intelligence and mental alertness are the most powerful enemies of dictatorship and at the same time the basic conditions of effective democracy.","It takes a certain amount of intelligence and imagination to realize the extraordinary queerness and mysteriousness of the world in which we live.","In the world of ideas everything was clear; in life all was obscure, embroiled.","Can you say something about nothing?","If you have behaved badly, repent, make what amends you can and address yourself to the task of behaving better next time.","Two hours. One hundred and twenty minutes. Anything might be done in that time. Anything. Nothing. Oh, he had had hundreds of hours, and what had he done with them? Wasted them, spilt the precious minutes as though his reservoir were inexhaustible.","Maybe this world is another planet\'s Hell.","And there\'s always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. In the past, you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your morality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears-that\'s what soma is.","All conditioning aims at that: making people like their inescapable social destiny.","To talk about religion except in terms of human psychology is an irrelevance.","Love is as necessary to human beings as food and shelter; [but] without intelligence, ... love is impotent and freedom unattainable.","One of the great triumphs of the nineteenth century was to limit the connotation of the word \\"immoral\\" in such a way that, for practical purposes, only those were immoral who drank too much or made too copious love. Those who indulged in any or all of the other deadly sins could look down in righteous indignation on the lascivious and the gluttonous.... In the name of all lechers and boozers I most solemnly protest against the invidious distinction made to our prejudice.","So the journey is over and I am back again where I started, richer by much experience and poorer by many unexploded certainties.  For convictions and certainties are too often the concomitants of ignorance.  Those who like to feel they are always right and who attached a high importance to their own opinions should stay at home. When one is traveling, convictions are mislaid as easily as spectacles; but unlike spectacles, they are not easily replaced.","Science in itself is morally neutral; it becomes good or evil according as it is applied.","[...] Technology has tended to devaluate the traditional vision-inducing materials. The illumination of a city, for example, was once a rare event, reserved for victories and national holidays, for the canonization of saints and the crowning of kings. Now it occurs nightly and celebrates the virtues of gin, cigarettes and toothpaste.","I\'m afraid of losing my obscurity. Genuineness only thrives in the dark. Like celery.","Real orgies are never so exciting as pornographic books. In a volume by Pierre Louys all the girls are young and their figures perfect; there\'s no hiccoughing or bad breath, no fatigue or boredom, no sudden recollections of unpaid bills or business letters unanswered, to interrupt the raptures. Art gives you the sensation, the thought, the feeling quite pure--chemically pure, I mean,... not morally.","Jehovah, Allah, the Trinity, Jesus, Buddha, are names for a great variety of human virtues, human mystical experiences, human remorses, human compensatory fantasies, human terrors, human cruelties. If all men were alike, all the world would worship the same God.","Parodies and caricatures are the most penetrating of criticisms.","Good is that which makes for unity. Evil is that which makes for separateness.","Every man who knows how to read has it in his power to magnify himself, to multiply the ways in which he exists, to make his life full, significant and interesting.","It is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem all one\'s life and find at the end that one has no more to offer by way of advice than \'try to be a little kinder.\'","Man has an almost infinite capacity for taking things and people for granted and thereby missing out on the pleasure of being grateful that things aren\'t worse and of praising and thereby lifting the spirits of others.","Can we unite against ourselves for our own higher interest?","Experience is not a matter of having actually swum the Hellespont, or danced with the dervishes, or slept in a doss-house. It is a matter of sensibility and intuition, of seeing, and hearing the significant thing, of paying attention at the right moments, of understanding and coordinating. Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him.","Cynical realism is the intelligent man\'s best excuse for doing nothing in an intolerable situation.","But the quiet grows and grows. Beautifully and unbearably.","We tend to think and feel in terms of the art we like; and if the art we like is bad then our thinking and feeling will be bad. And if the thinking and feeling of most of the individuals composing a society is bad, is not that society in danger?","Words are good servants but bad masters.","There is something curiously boring about somebody else\'s happiness.","Let us be kinder to one another.","All democracies are based on the proposition that power is very dangerous and that it is extremely important not to let any one person or small group have too much power for too long a time","We lie to ourselves in order that we may still have the excuse of ignorance, the alibi of stupidity and incomprehension, possessing which we can continue with a good conscience to commit and tolerate the most monstrous crimes.","Liberate yourselves from everything you know and look with complete innocence at this infinitely improbable thing before you.","To travel is to discover that everybody is wrong. The philosophies, the civilizations which seem, at a distance, so superior to those current at home, all prove on a close inspection to be in their own way just as hopelessly imperfect.","The critics don\'t interest me because they\'re concerned with what\'s past and done, while I\'m concerned with what comes next.","The greater a man\'s talents, the greater his power to lead astray.","I\'m sick. I\'ve eaten civilisation and I\'m sick.","Happiness is a hard master, particularly other people\'s happiness.","Every gain made by individuals or societies is almost instantly taken for granted. The luminous ceiling toward which we raise our longing eyes becomes, when we have climbed to the next floor, a stretch of disregarded linoleum beneath our feet.","Ironically enough, the only people who can hold up indefinitely under the stress of modern war are psychotics. Individual insanity is immune to the consequences of collective insanity.","Civilization means food and literature all round. Beefsteaks and fiction magazines for all. First-class proteins for the body, fourth-class love-stories for the spirit.","Happiness is not achieved by the conscious pursuit of happiness; it is generally the by-product of other activities.","Science has explained nothing; the more we know the more fantastic the world becomes and the profounder the surrounding darkness.","I am I, and I wish I weren\'t.","Suppose it were perfectly certain that the life and fortune of each of us would some day depend upon our winning or losing a game of chess. Do you not think that we should all consider it to be our primary duty to learn at least the names of the pieces and how to position them on the chessboard?","The religions whose theology is least preoccupied with events in time and most concerned with eternity, have been consistently less violent and more humane in political practice. Unlike early Judaism, Christianity and Mohammedanism (all obsessed with time) Hinduism and Buddhism have never been persecuting faiths, have preached almost no holy wars and have refrained from that proselytizing religious imperialism which has gone hand in hand with political and economic oppression of colored people.","Well... ...That\'s what you always forget, isn\'t it? I mean, you forget to pay attention to what\'s happening. And that\'s the same as not being here and now.","Habit converts luxurious enjoyments into dull and daily necessities.","Men have always been a prey to distractions, which arethe original sins of the mind; but never before today has an attempt been made to organize and exploit distractions, to make of them, because of their economic importance, the core and vital center of human life, to idealize them as the highest manifestations of mental activity. Ours is an age of systematized irrelevances, and the imbecile within us has become one of the Titans, upon whose shoulders rests the weight of the social and economic system","We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves. [...] By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies - all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable.","A bad book is as much of a labor to write as a good one, it comes as sincerely from the author\'s soul.","To be shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception, to be shown for a few timeless hours the outer and the inner world, not as they appear to an animal obsessed with words and notions, but as they are apprehended, directly and unconditionally, by Mind at Large-This is the experience of inestimable value to everyone.","Real progress is progress in charity, all other advances being secondary thereto.","The whole story of the universe is implicit in any part of it. The meditative eye can look through any single object and see, as through a window, the entire cosmos. Make the smell of roast duck in an old kitchen diaphanous and you will have a glimpse of everything, from the spiral nebulae to Mozart\'s music and the stigmata of St. Francis of Assisi. The artistic problem is to produce diaphanousness in spots, selecting the spots so as to reveal only the most humanly significant of distant vistas behind the near familiar object.","Consider the problem of over-population. Rapidly mounting human numbers are pressing ever more heavily on natural resources. What is to be\\n done?... The annual increase of numbers should be reduced. But how? We\\n are given two choices -- famine, pestilence and war on the one hand,\\n birth control on the other. Most of us choose birth control.","For the first time in the history of the world, Buddhism proclaimed a salvation which each individual could gain from him or herself, in this world, during this life, without any least reference to God, or to gods either great or small.","The sum of evil, Pascal remarked, would be much diminished if men could only learn to sit quietly in their rooms.","Man is so intelligent that he feels impelled to invent theories to account for what happens in the world. Unfortunately, he is not quite intelligent enough, in most cases, to find correct explanations. So that when he acts on his theories, he behaves very often like a lunatic.","Those who believe that they are exclusively in the right are generally those who achieve something.","Great is truth, but still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth.","Silence is as full of potential wisdom and wit as the unshown marble of great sculpture.  The silent bear no witness against themselves.","What\u2019s the point of truth or beauty or knowledge when anthrax bombs are popping all around you?","The business of a seer is to see; and if he involves himself in the kind of God-eclipsing activities which make seeing impossible, he betrays the trust which his fellows have tacitly placed in him.","When people are suspicious with you, you start being suspicious with them.","Too much consistency is as bad for the mind as for the body.","And no wonder; for the new technique of \\"subliminal projection,\\" as it was called, was intimately associated with mass entertainment, and in the life of civilized human beings massed entertainment now plays a part comparable to that played in the Middle Ages be religion.","My sympathies are, of course, with the Government side, especially the Anarchists ; for Anarchism seems to me more likely to lead to desirable social change than highly centralized, dictatorial Communism .","I know the outer world as well as you do, and I judge it. You know nothing of my inner world, and yet you presume to judge that world.","Idealism is the noble toga that political gentlemen drape over their will to power.","The pursuit of truth is just a polite name for the intellectual\'s favorite pastime of substituting simple and therefore false abstractions for the living complexities of reality.","The Humanity of men and women is inversely proportional to their Numbers. A Crowd is no more human than an Avalanche or a Whirlwind. A rabble of men and women stands lower in the scale of moral and intellectual being than a herd of Swine or of Jackals.","The only consistent people are the dead","Death is the only thing we haven\'t succeeded in completely vulgarizing.","The brotherhood of men does not imply their equality. Families have their fools and their men of genius, their black sheep and their saints, their worldly successes and their worldly failures. A man should treat his brothers lovingly and with justice, according to the deserts of each. But the deserts of every brother are not the same.","The lion will lay down with the lamb...but every morning they\'ll have to provide a new lamb. Maybe this world is another planet\'s hell.","You should hurry up and acquire the cigar habit. It\'s one of the major happinesses. And so much more lasting than love, so much less costly in emotional wear and tear.","Being cared for when one is dead is less satisfactory than being cared for when one is alive.","The social body persists although the component cells may change.","The charm of history and its enigmatic lesson consist in the fact that, from age to age, nothing changes and yet everything is completely different.","Unlike the masses, intellectuals have a taste for rationality and an interest in facts.","Folly is often more cruel in the consequences than malice can be in the intent.","Results only come to those who master the paradoxical art of doing and not doing, of letting go as a person in order that the immanent and transcendent unknown quantity may take hold. We cannot make ourselves understand; the most we can do is to foster a state of mind in which understanding may come to us.","Deprived of their newspapers or a novel, reading-addicts will fall back onto cookery books, on the literature which is wrapped around bottles of patent medicine, on those instructions for keeping the contents crisp which are printed on the outside of boxes of breakfast cereals. On anything.","The more stitches, the less riches.","...it is not what one has experienced but what one does with what one has experienced that matters.","No holiday is ever anything but a disappointment.","Somewhere in the rain, there will always be an abandoned dog that prevents you from being happy.","The most intractable of our experiences is the experience of Time-the intuition of duration, combined with the thought of perpetual perishing.","Like every other good thing in this world, leisure and culture have to be paid for. Fortunately, however, it is not the leisured and the cultured who have to pay.","Perhaps it\'s good for one to suffer. Can an artist do anything if he\'s happy? Would he ever want to do anything? What is art, after all, but a protest against the horrible inclemency of life?","To be excited is still to be unsatisfied.","Peace is a necessary condition of spirituality, no less than an inevitable result of it.","Thought of the incomprehensible sequence of changes and chances that make up a life, all the beauties and horrors and absurdities whose conjunctions create the uninterpretable and yet divinely significant pattern of human destiny.","Given the nature of spiders, webs are inevitable. And given the nature of human beings, so are religions. Spiders can\'t help making fly-traps, and men can\'t help making symbols. That\'s what the human brain is there for - the turn the chaos of given experience into a set of manageable symbols.","Something that had been a single cell, a cluster of cells, a little sac of tissue, a kind of worm, a potential fish with gills, stirred in her womb and would one day become a man--a grown man, suffering and enjoying, loving and hating, thinking, remembering, imagining. And what had been a blob of jelly within her body would invent a god and worship; what had been a kind of fish would create, and, having created, would become the battleground of disputing good and evil; what had blindly lived in her as a parasitic worm would look at the stars, would listen to music, would read poetry.","A man can smile and smile and be a villain.","In the days before machinery men and women who wanted to amuse themselves were compelled, in their humble way, to be artists. Now they sit still and permit professionals to entertain them by the aid of machinery. It is difficult to believe that general artistic culture can flourish in this atmosphere of passivity.","Specialized meaninglessness has come to be regarded, in certain circles, as a kind of hallmark of true science.","At any given moment, life is completely senseless. But viewed over a period, it seems to reveal itself as an organism existing in time, having a purpose, trending in a certain direction.","There is no bad day that can\u2019t be overcome by listening to a barbershop quartet. This is just truth, plain and simple.","Writers write to influence their readers, their preachers, their auditors, but always, at bottom, to be more themselves.","All right then,\\" said the Savage defiantly, \\"I\'m claiming the right to be unhappy.","It takes two to make a murder. There are born victims, born to have their throats cut, as the cut-throats are born to be hanged.","The flower of the present rosily blossomed.","The best way to find things out is not to ask questions at all. If you fire off a question, it is like firing off a gun - bang it goes","I\'d rather be myself,\\" he said. \\"Myself and nasty. Not somebody else, however jolly.","What drivel it all is!... A string of words called religion. Another string of words called philosophy. Half a dozen other stringscalled political ideals. And all the words either ambiguous or meaningless. And people getting so excited about them they\'ll murder their neighbours for using a word they don\'t happen to like. A word that probably doesn\'t mean as much as a good belch. Just a noise without even the excuse of gas on the stomach.","God isn\'t compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness. You must make your choice. Our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness.","The nature of oratory is such that there has always been a tendency among politicians and clergymen to oversimplify complex matters. From a pulpit or a platform even the most conscientious of speakers finds it very difficult to tell the whole truth.","We objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom.","Marble, I perceive, covers a multitude of sins.","Human contacts have been so highly valued in the past only because reading was not a common accomplishment.... The world, you must remember, is only just becoming literate. As reading becomes more and more habitual and widespread, an ever-increasing number of people will discover that books will give them all the pleasures of social life and none of its intolerable tedium.","Words form the thread on which we string our experiences.","Oh, how desperately bored, in spite of their grim determination to have a Good Time, the majority of pleasure-seekers really are!","In the course of history many more people have died for their drink and their dope than have died for their religion or their country.","Generalities are intellectually necessary evils.","What man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder.","Who lives longer? The man who takes heroin for two years and dies, or a man who lives on roast beef, water and potatoes \'till 95? One passes his 24 months in eternity. All the years of the beefeater are lived only in time.","Suddenly to realise that one is sitting, damned, among the other damned--it is a most disquieting experience; so disquieting thatmost of us react to it by immediately plunging more deeply into our particular damnation in the hope, generally realized, that we may be able, at least for a time, to stifle our revolutionary knowledge.","Most vices demand considerable self-sacrifices. There is no greater mistake than to suppose that a vicious life is a life of uninterrupted pleasure. It is a life almost as wearisome and painful -- if strenuously led -- as Christian\'s in The Pilgrim\'s Progress.","The traveller\'s-eye view of men and women is not satisfying. A man might spend his life in trains and restaurants and know nothing of humanity at the end. To know, one must be an actor as well as a spectator.","Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery.","Sixty two thousand four hundred repetitions make one truth. Idiots!","The man who comes back through the Door in the Wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out. He will be wiser but less sure, happier but less self-satisfied, humbler in acknowledging his ignorance yet better equipped to understand the relationship of words to things, of systematic reasoning to the unfathomable mystery which it tries, forever vainly, to comprehend","The impulse to cruelty is, in many people, almost as violent as the impulse to sexual love - almost as violent and much more mischievous.","There was a thing called Heaven; but all the same they used to drink enormous quantities of alcohol.","I like being myself. Myself and nasty.","Dinted dimpled wimpled-his mind wandered down echoing corridors of assonance and alliteration ever further and further from the point. He was enamoured with the beauty of words.","From their experience or from the recorded experience of others (history), men learn only what their passions and their metaphysical prejudices allow them to learn.","If humans were in fact the members of a truly social species, and if their individual differences were trifling and could be completely ironed out by appropriate conditioning, then, obviously, there would be no need for liberty and the State would be justified in persecuting the heretics who demanded it.","For some strange reason murder has always seemed more respectable than fornication. Few people are shocked when they hear God described as the God of Battles; but what an outcry there would be if anyone spoke of him as the God of Brothels.","Every civilization is, among other things, an arrangement for domesticating the passions and setting them to do useful work.","I used to think I had no will to power. Now I perceive that I vented it on thoughts, rather than people. Conquering an unknown province of knowledge. Getting the better of a problem. Forcing ideas to associate or come apart. Bullying recalcitrant words to assume a certain pattern. All the fun of being a dictator without any risks and responsibilities.","Man is an amphibian who lives simultaneously in two worlds-the given and the home-made, the world of matter, life and consciousness and the world of symbols.","Man approaches the unattainable truth through a succession of errors.","Words are magical in the way they affect the minds of those who use them.","We are not our own any more than what we possess is our own. We did not make ourselves, we cannot be supreme over ourselves. We are not our own masters.","The Christian idea of a perfect heaven that is something other than a non-existence is a contradiction in terms.","The optimum population is modeled on the iceberg- eight-ninths below the water line, one-ninth above.","Only one more indispensable massacre of Capitalists or Communists or Fascists or Christians or Heretics, and there we are in the Golden Future.","War is often described as a law of nature-this is not true: Among the lower animals, war is unknown.","The moral peril to humanity of thoughtlessly accepting these conveniences [of materialism] (with their inherent disadvantages) as constituting a philosophy of life is now becoming apparent. For the implications of this disruptive materialism... are that human beings are nothing but bodies, animals, machines.","Thought is barred in this City of Dreadful Joy and conversation is unknown.","In spiritual matters, knowledge is dependent upon being; as we are, so we know.","Societies are composed of individuals and are good only insofar as they help individuals to realize their potentialities and to lead a happy and creative life.","The course of every intellectual, if he pursues his journey long and unflinchingly enough, ends in the obvious, from which the non-intellectuals have never stirred.","The proper study of mankind is books.","Katy was neither a Methodist nor a Masochist. She was a goddess and the silence of goddesses is genuinely golden. None of your superficial plating. A solid, twenty-two-carat silence all the way through. The Olympian\'s trap is kept shut, not by an act of willed discretion, but because there\'s really nothing to say. Goddesses are all of one piece. There\'s no internal conflict in them. Whereas the lives of people like you and me are one long argument. Desires on one side, woodpeckers on the other. Never a moment of real silence.","To be enlightened is to be aware, always, of total reality in its immanent otherness - to be aware of it and yet remain in a condition to survive as an animal. Our goal is to discover that we have always been where we ought to be. Unhappily we make the task exceedingly difficult for ourselves.","Feasts must be solemn and rare, or else they cease to be feasts.","Our goal is to discover that we have always been where we ought to be","Both of us victims of the same twentieth-century plague. Not the Black Death, this time; the Gray Life.","There is no substitute for talent. Industry and all its virtues are of no avail.","Man must learn to simplify, but not to the point of falsification.","Pleasure cannot be shared; like Pain, it can only be experienced or inflicted, and when we give Pleasure to our Lovers or bestow Charity upon the Needy, we do so, not to gratify the object of our Benevolence, but only ourselves. For the Truth is that we are kind for the same reason as we are cruel, in order that we may enhance the sense of our own Power.","Bondage is the life of personality, and for bondage the personal self will fight with tireless resourcefulness and the most stubborn cunning.","The effectiveness of political and religious propaganda depends upon the methods employed, not upon the doctrines taught. These doctrines may be true or false, wholesome or pernicious it makes little or no difference.","\\"All right then,\\" said the savage defiantly, I\'m claiming the right to be unhappy.\\" \\n\\"Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat, the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen tomorrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.\\" \\nThere was a long silence. \\n\\"I claim them all,\\" said the Savage at last.","Teaching is the last refuge of feeble minds with a classical education.","I have always found that Angels have the vanity to speak of themselves as the only wise.","The old idea that words possess magical powers is false; but its falsity is the distortion of a very important truth. Words do have a magical effect - but not in the way that magicians supposed, and not on the objects they were trying to influence. Words are magical in the way they affect the minds of those who use them.","[I am not] the captain of my soul; I am only its noisiest passenger.","But I don\'t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.","You got rid of them. Yes, that\u2019s just like you. Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it. Whether \u2018tis better in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them\u2026 But you don\u2019t do either. Neither suffer nor oppose. You just abolish the slings and arrows. It\u2019s too easy.","The more a man knows about himself in relation to every kind of experience, the greater his chance of suddenly, one fine morning, realizing who in fact he is.","Drill and uniforms impose an architecture on the crowd. An army\'s beautiful. But that\'s not all; it panders to lower instincts than the aesthetic. The spectacle of human beings reduced to automatism satisfies the lust for power. Looking at mechanized slaves, one fancies oneself a master.","I am ignorant and impotent and yet, somehow or other, here I am, unhappy, no doubt, profoundly dissatisfied ... In spite of everything I survive.","Happiness is never grand.","Orthodoxy is the diehard of the world of thought. It learns not, neither can it forget.","Universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning, truth and beauty can\'t.","Individual insanity is immune to the consequences of collective insanity","The man who has successfully solved the problem of his relations with the two worlds of data and symbols is a man who has no beliefs. With regard to the problems of practical life he entertains a series of working hypotheses, which serve his purposes, but are taken no more seriously than any other kind of tool or instrument. In other words, symbols should never be raised to the rank of dogmas, nor should any system be regarded as more than a provisional convenience.","Those who feel themselves despised do well to look despising.","Everybody strains after happiness, and the result is that nobody\'s happy.","Man is an intelligence in servitude to his organs.","If you want to be a psychological novelist and write about human beings, the best thing you can do is keep a pair of cats.","Speed, it seems to me, provides the one genuinely modern pleasure.","When the individual feels, the community reels.","Grace is always sufficient, provided we are ready to cooperate with it. If we fail to do our share, but rather choose to rely on self-will and self-direction, we shall not only get no help from the graces bestowed on us, we shall actually make it impossible for further graces to be given.","Industrial man\u2014a sentient reciprocating engine having a fluctuating output, coupled to an iron wheel revolving with uniform velocity. And then we wonder why this should be the golden age of revolution and mental derangement.","Which is better: to have fun with fungi or to have Idiocy with ideology, to have wars because of words, to have tomorrow\'s misdeeds out of yesterday\'s miscreeds?","One of the many reasons for the bewildering and tragic character of human existence is the fact that social organization is at once necessary and fatal. Men are forever creating such organizations for their own convenience and forever finding themselves the victims of their home-made monsters.","What a gulf between impression and expression! That\u2019s our ironic fate\u2014to have Shakespearean feelings and (unless by some billion-to-one chance we happen to be Shakespeare) to talk about them like automobile salesmen or teen-agers or college professors. We practice alchemy in reverse\u2014touch gold and it turns into lead; touch the pure lyrics of experience, and they turn into the verbal equivalents of tripe and hogwash.","The ductless glands secrete among other things our moods, our aspirations, our philosophy of life.","An ideal is merely the projection, on an enormously enlarged scale, of some aspect of personality.","People will insist on treating the mons Veneris as though it were Mount Everest. Too silly!","A squat grey building of only thirty-four stories. Over the main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE, and, in a shield, the World State\'s motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.","Back to culture. Yes, actually to culture. You can\u2019t consume much if you sit still and read books.","To write fiction, one needs a whole series of inspirations about people in an actual environment, and then a whole lot of work on the basis of those inspirations.","I know very dimly when I start what\'s going to happen. I just have a very general idea, and then the thing develops as I write.","I met, not long ago, a young man who aspired to become a novelist. Knowing that I was in the profession, he asked me to tell him how he should set to work to realize his ambition. I did my best to explain. \'The first thing,\' I said, \'is to buy quite a lot of paper, a bottle of ink, and a pen. After that you merely have to write.\'","Why do you love the woman you\'re in love with? Because she is. And that, after all, is God\'s own definition of Himself; I am that I am. The girl is who she is. Some of her isness spills over and impregnates the entire universe. Objects and events cease to be mere representations of classes and become their own uniqueness; cease to be illustrations of verbal abstractions and become fully concrete. Then you stop being in love, and the universe collapses, with an almost audible squeak of derision, into its normal insignificance.","The Alexander Technique gives us all things we have been looking for in a system of physical education: relief from strain due to maladjustment, and constant improvement in physical and mental health. We cannot ask for more from any system; nor, if we seriously desire to alter human beings in a desirable direction, can we ask for any less.","Wherever we turn we find that the real obstacles to peace are human will and feeling, human convictions, prejudices, opinions. If we want to get rid of war we must get rid first of all of its psychological causes. Only when this has been done will the rulers of the nations even desire to get rid of the economic and political causes.","You can\'t make flivers without steel - and you can\'t make tragedies without social instability. The world\'s stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can\'t get. They\'re well off; they\'re safe; they\'re never ill; they\'re not afraid of death; they\'re blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they\'re plagued with no mothers or fathers; they\'ve got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they\'re so conditioned that they pratically can\'t help behaving as they ought to behave.","To aspire to be superhuman is a most discreditable admission that you lack the guts, the wit, the moderating judgment to be successfully and consummately human.","Uncontrolled, the hunger and thirst after God may become an obstacle, cutting off the soul from what it desires. If a man would travel far along the mystic road, he must learn to desire God intensely but in stillness, passively and yet with all his heart and mind and strength.","The indispensible is not necessarily the desirable.","The soul of wit may become the very body of untruth. However elegant and memorable, brevity can never, in the nature of things, do justice to all the facts of a complex situations. On such a theme one can be brief only by omission and simplification. Omission and simplification help us to understand - but help is, in many cases, to understand the wrong thing; for our comprehension may be only of the abbreviator\'s neatly formulated notions, not of the vast, ramifying reality from which these notions have been so arbitrarily abstracted.","What with making their way and enjoying what they have won, heroes have no time to think. But the sons of heroes - ah, they have all the necessary leisure.","When the sun rises, it rises for everyone.","Eating, drinking, dying - three primary manifestations of the universal and impersonal life. Animals live that impersonal and universal life without knowing its nature. Ordinary people know its nature but don\'t live it and, if they think seriously about it, refuse to accept it. An enlightened person knows it, lives it, and accepts it completely. He eats, he drinks, and in due course he dies - but he eats with a difference, drinks with a difference, dies with a difference.","We can\'t allow science to undo its own good work.","Champagne had the taste of an apple peeled with a steel knife.","Hell is the incapacity to be other than the creature one finds oneself ordinarily behaving as.","Half at least of all morality is negative and consists in keeping out of mischief. The lords prayer is less than 50 words long, and 6 of those words are devoted to asking god not to lead us into temptation.","Compared with that of Taoists and Far Eastern Buddhists, the Christian attitude toward Nature has been curiously insensitive and often downright domineering and violent. Taking their cue from an unfortunate remark in Genesis, Catholic moralists have regarded animals as mere things which men do right to regard for their own ends. . . .","The inconveniences and horrors of the pox are perfectly well known to every one; but still the disease flourishes and spreads. Several million people were killed in a recent war and half the world ruined; but we all busily go on in courses that make another event of the same sort inevitable. Experientia docet? Experientia doesn\'t.","A man who has trained himself in goodness come to have certain direct intuitions about character, about the relations between human beings, about his own position in the world - intuitions that are quite different from the intuitions of the average sensual man.","It is possible to argue that the really influential book is not that which converts ten millions of casual readers, but rather that which converts the very few who, at any given moment, succeed in seizing power. Marx and Sorel have been influential in the modern world, not so much because they were best-sellers (Sorel in particular was not at all a widely read author), but because among their few readers were two men, called respectively Lenin and Mussolini.","I am entirely on the side of mystery.  I mean, any attempt to explain away the mystery is ridiculous. I believe in the profound and unfathomable mystery of life which has a sort of divine quality about it.","All our science is just a cookery book, with an orthodox theory of cooking that nobody\'s allowed to question, and a list of recipes that mustn\'t be added to except by special permission from the head cook.","In a word, they failed to take into account man\'s almost infinite appetite for distractions.","Those who meant well behaved in the same way as those who meant badly.","It is only when it takes the form of physical addiction that sex is evil. It is also evil when it manifests itself as a way of satisfying the lust for power or the climber\'s craving for position and social distinction.","Man\'s life on earth has only one end and purpose: to identify himself with his eternal Self and so to come to unitive knowledge of the Divine Ground.","In actual life a downward movement may sometimes be made the beginning of an ascent.","What wonder, then, if human beings in their search for the divine have generally preferred to look within!","Every gain made by individuals or society is almost instantly taken for granted.","Reality, however utopian, is something from which people feel the need of taking pretty frequent holidays.","A belief in hell and the knowledge that every ambition is doomed to frustration at the hands of a skeleton have never prevented the majority of human beings from behaving as though death were no more than an unfounded rumor.","For the born traveller, travelling is a besetting vice. Like other vices, it is imperious, demanding its victim\'s time, money, energy and the sacrifice of comfort.","I don\'t care where I\'m from, nor where I\'m going. From hell to hell.","Visionary experience is not the same as mystical experience. Mystical experience is beyond the realm of opposites. Visionary experience is still within that realm. Heaven entails hell, and \'going to heaven\' is no more liberation than is the descent into horror. Heaven is merely a vantage point from which the divine Ground can be more clearly seen than on the level of ordinary individual experience.","Grace is always sufficient, provided we are ready to cooperate with it.","I was not looking now at an unusual flower arrangement.  I was seeing what Adam had seen on the morning of his creation - the miracle, moment by moment, of naked existence.","Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic tradition into which he has been born.","The most distressing thing that can happen to a prophet is to be proved wrong. The next most distressing thing is to be proved right.","Christianity accepted as given a metaphysical system derived from several already existing and mutually incompatible systems.","Impulse arrested spills over, and the flood is feeling, the flood is passion, the flood is even madness.","Proportion ... You can\'t help thinking about it in these London streets, where it doesn\'t exist ... It\'s like listening to a symphony of cats to walk along them. Senseless discords and a horrible disorder all the way ... We need no barbarians from outside; they\'re on the premises, all the time.","After all, what is reading but a vice, like drink or venery or any other form of excessive self-indulgence? One reads to tickle and amuse one\'s mind; one reads, above all, to prevent oneself thinking.","Science and art are only too often a superior kind of dope, possessing this advantage over booze and morphia: that they can be indulged in with a good conscience and with the conviction that, in the process of indulging, one is leading the higher life.","The thing that impresses me most about this country is its hopefulness. It is this which distinguishes it from Europe, where there is hopeless depression and fear.","Sons have always a rebellious wish to be disillusioned by that which charmed their fathers.","When life appears to be working against you, when your luck is down, when the supposedly wrong people show up, or when you slip up and return to old, self-defeating habits, recognize the signs that you\'re out of harmony with intention.","I ate civilization. It poisoned me; I was defiled. And then,\\" he added in a lower tone, \\"I ate my own wickedness.","Your true traveller finds boredom rather agreeable than painful. It is the symbol of his liberty - his excessive freedom. He accepts his boredom, when it comes, not merely philosophically, but almost with pleasure.","I believe one would write better if the climate were bad. If there were a lot of wind and storms for example.","It was one of those evenings when men feel that truth, goodness and beauty are one. In the morning, when they commit their discovery to paper, when others read it written there, it looks wholly ridiculous.","For [D.H.] Lawrence, existence was one continuous convalescence; it was as though he were newly reborn from a mortal illness every day of his life. What these convalescent eyes saw, his most casual speech would reveal.","For myself, as, no doubt, for most of my contemporaries, the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation. The liberation we desired was simultaneously liberation from a certain political and economic system and liberation from a certain system of morality. We objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom.","The self is coming from a state of pure awareness from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in a outward manifesation of the physical world, including fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions","Everyone belongs to everyone else.","No man, however civilized, can listen for very long to African drumming, or Indian chanting, or Welsh hymn singing, and retain intact his critical and self-conscious personality.","Pain was a fascinating horror","An irrelevance, and your life\'s altered.","A poor degenerate from the ape, Whose hands are four, whose tail\'s a limb, I contemplate my flaccid shape And know I may not rival him Save with my mind.","What\'s the greatest enemy of Christianity to-day? Frozen meat. In the past only members of the upper classes were thoroughly sceptical, despairing, negative. Why? Among other reasons, because they were the only people who could afford to eat too much meat. Now there\'s cheap Canterbury lamb and Argentine chilled beef. Even the poor can afford to poison themselves into complete scepticism and despair.","Family, monogamy, romance. Everywhere exclusiveness, a narrow channelling of impulse and energy.","But then people don\'t read literature in order to understand; they read it because they want to re-live the feelings and sensations which they found exciting in the past. Art can be a lot of things; but in actual practice, most of it is merely the mental equivalent of alcohol and cantharides.","I had to depend on Braille for my reading and guide for my walking...I am now wearing no glasses, reading and all without strain...by taking lessons in seeing...optometrists hate the method.","...we were back at home, and I had returned to that reassuring but profoundly unsatisfactory state known as \'being in one\'s right mind.","Knowledge is an affair of symbols and is, all too often, a hindrance to wisdom, the uncovering of the self from moment to moment","The leech\'s kiss, the squid\'s embrace, The prurient ape\'s defiling touch: And do you like the human race? No, not much.","A man may be a pessimistic determinist before lunch and an optimistic believer in the will\'s freedom after it.","My fate cannot be mastered; it can only be collaborated with and thereby, to some extent, directed. Nor am I the captain of my soul; I am only its noisiest passenger.","At this point we find ourselves confronted by a very disquieting question: Do we really wish to act upon our knowledge?","The mockery made him feel an outsider; and feeling an outsider he behaved like one, which increased the prejudice against him and intensified the contempt and hostility aroused by his physical defects. Which in turn increased his sense of being alien and alone. A chronic fear of being slighted made him avoid his equals, made him stand, where his inferiors were concerned, self-consciously on his dignity.","This really revolutionary revolution is to be achieved, not in the external world, but in the souls and flesh of human beings.","As late as the seventeenth century, monarchs owned so little furniture that they had to travel from palace to palace with wagon-loads of plate and bedspreads, of carpets and tapestries.","The author of the Iliad is either Homer or, if not Homer, somebody else of the same name.","Men make use of their illnesses at least as much as they are made use of by them.","I want to know what passion is. I want to feel something strongly.","Such prosperity as we have known it up to the present is the consequence of rapidly spending the planet\'s irreplaceable capital.","De Sade is the one completely consistent and thoroughgoing revolutionary of history.","A man may have strong humanitarian and democratic principles, but if he happens to have been brought up as a bath-taking, shirt-changing lover of fresh air, he will have to overcome certain physical repugnance before he can bring himself to put those principles into practice.","People believe in God because they\'ve been conditioned to believe in God.","Industrial civilization is only possible when there\'s no self-denial. Self-indulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and economics. Otherwise the wheels stop turning.","A love of nature keeps no factories busy.","One thinks one\'s something unique and wonderful at the center of the universe, when in fact one\'s just a slight interruption in the ongoing march of entropy.","Nothing is more dreadful than a cold, unimpassioned indulgence. And love infallibly becomes cold and unimpassioned when it is too lightly made.","The really important facts were that spatial relationships had ceased to matter very much and that my mind was perceiving the world in terms of other than spatial categories. At ordinary times the eye concerns itself with such problems as where? \u2014 how far? \u2014 how situated in relation to what? In the mescaline experience the implied questions to which the eye responds are of another order. Place and distance cease to be of much interest. The mind does its perceiving in terms of intensity of existence, profundity of significance, relationships within a pattern.","The place is good. How good, one must have circumnavigated the globe to discover. Why not stay? Take root? But roots are chains. I have a terror of losing my freedom. Free, without ties, unpossessed by any possessions, free to do as one will, to go at a moment\'s notice wherever the fancy may suggest--it is good. But so is this place. Might it not be better? To gain freedom one sacrifices something [...] and all that these things and people signify. One sacrifices something--for a greater gain in knowledge, in understanding, in intensified living? I sometimes wonder.","What the rest of us see only under the influence of mescalin, the artist is congenitally equipped to see all the time.","There are few who would not rather be taken in adultery than in provocation.","If you look up \'Intelligence\' in the new volumes of the Encyclopeadia Britannica, you\'ll find it classified under the following three heads: Intelligence, Human; Intelligence, Animal; Intelligence, Military. My stepfather\'s a perfect specimen of Intelligence, Military.","One cubic centimeter cures ten gloomy sentiments.","Life\'s so ordinary that literature has to deal with the exceptional. Exceptional talent, power, social position, wealth.... Dramabegins where there\'s freedom of choice. And freedom of choice begins when social or psychological conditions are exceptional. That\'s why the inhabitants of imaginative literature have always been recruited from the pages of Who\'s Who.","Official dignity tends to increase in inverse ratio to the importance of the country in which the office is held.","Most loverspicture to themselves, in their mistresses, a secret reality, beyond and different from what they see every day. They are in love with somebody else--their own invention. And sometimes there is a secret reality; and sometimes reality and appearance are the same. The discovery, in either case, is likely to cause a shock.","Abused as we abuse it at present, dramatic art is in no sense cathartic; it is merely a form of emotional masturbation.","Nothing \u2014 the only perfection, the only absolute. Infinite and eternal nothing.","Pully, hauly, tug with a will; the gods wiggle waggle, but the sky stands still.","The creation by word-power of something out of nothing--what is that but magic? And, may I add, what is that but literature?","Modern man\'s besetting temptation is to sacrifice his direct perceptions and spontaneous feelings to his reasoned reflections; to prefer in all circumstances the verdict of his intellect to that of his immediate intuitions.","Lying in bed, he would think of Heaven and London.","A type of revolutionary novelty may be extremely beautiful in itself; but, for the creatures of habit that we are, its very novelty tends to make it illegible, at any rate to begin with.","If Men and Women took their Pleasures as noisily as the Cats, what Londoner could ever hope to sleep of nights?","You all remember, I suppose, that beautiful and inspired saying of Our Ford\'s: History is bunk.","Literary or scientific, liberal or specialist, all our education is predominantly verbal and therefore fails to accomplish what it is supposed to do. Instead of transforming children into fully developed adults, it turns out students of the natural sciences who are completely unaware of Nature as the primary fact of experience, it inflicts upon the world students of the humanities who know nothing of humanity, their own or anyone else\'s.","A whole population of strangers inhabited and shaped that little body, lived in that mind and controlled its wishes, dictated its thoughts...The name was an abstraction, a title arbitrarily given, like \\"France\\" or \\"England,\\" to a collection, never long the same, of many individuals who were born, lived, and died within him, as the inhabitants of a country appear and disappear, but keep alive in their passage the identity of the nation to which they belong.","Finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons - that\'s philosophy.","But every one belongs to every one else","You\'ve got to be hurt and upset; otherwise you can\'t think of the really good, penetrating, X-rayish phrases.","Intellectuals ... regard over-simplification as the original sin of the mind and have no use for the slogans, the unqualified assertions and sweeping generalizations.","Like every man of sense and good feeling, I abominate work.","Dedicated to all those who say: \\"I don\'t have time for analytics\\" or \\"I don\'t understand analytics\\".","If the men of the Middle Ages... lived in filth and discomfort, it was not for any lack of ability to change their mode of life; it was because they chose to live this way, because filth and discomfort fitted in with their principles and prejudices, political, moral, and religious.... It was in the power of medieval... craftsmen to create armchairs and sofas that might have rivaled in comfort those of today","All the advantages of Christianity and alcohol; none of their defects.","In books, the proportion of exceptional to commonplace people is high; in reality, very low.","Fortunately, however, birds don\'t understand pep talks. Not even St. Francis\'. Just imagine, he went on, preaching sermons to perfectly good thrushes and goldfinches and chiff-chaffs! What presumption! Why couldn\'t he have kept his mouth shut and let the birds preach to him?","And that,\\" put in the Director sententiously, \\"that is the secret of happiness and virtue \u2014 liking what you\'ve got to do. All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny.","In regard to man\'s final end, all the higher religions are in complete agreement. The purpose of human life is the discovery of Truth, the unitive knowledge of the Godhead.","Abused as we abuse it at present, dramatic art is in no sense cathartic; it is merely a form of emotional masturbation. It is the rarest thing to find a player who has not had his character affected for the worse by the practice of his profession. Nobody can make a habit of self-exhibition, nobody can exploit his personality for the sake of exercising a kind of hypnotic power over others, and remain untouched by the process.","The instinct of acquisitiveness has more perverts, I believe, than the instinct of sex. At any rate, people seem to me odder about money than about even their amours.","It\'s a very salutary thing to realize that the rather dull universe in which most of us spend most of our time is not the only universe there is. I think it\'s healthy that people should have this experience.","Craving for power is not a vice of the body, consequently it knows none of the limitations imposed by a tired or satiated physiology upon gluttony, intemperance and lust","The poet is born with the capacity of arranging words in such a way that something of the quality of the graces and inspirations he has received can make itself felt to other human beings in the white spaces, so to speak, between the lines of his verse. This is a great and precious gift; but if the poet remains content with his gift, if he persists in worshipping the beauty in art and nature without going on to make himself capable, through selflessness, of apprehending Beauty as it is in the divine Ground, then he is only an idolater.","The lunatic fringe is more like a Spanish shawl, where the fringe makes up the entire garment.","Home, home -- a few small rooms, stiflingly over-inhabited by a man, by a periodically teeming woman, by a rabble of boys and girls of all ages. No air, no space; an understerilized prison; darkness, disease, and smells.","People are much too solemn about things - I\'m all for sticking pins into episcopal behinds.","Every significant artist is a metaphysician, a propounder of beauty-truths and form-theories.","One right-thinking man thinks like all other right-thinking men of his time that is to say, in most cases, like some wrong-thinking man of another time.","It is natural to believe in God when you\'re alone-- quite alone, in the night, thinking about death.","When truth is nothing but truth, it\'s unnatural, it\'s an abstraction that resembles nothing in the real world.","Everyone thinks this way at some point. The important thing is to power through and get to learning. If you really don\'t have the time Let Me Handle Your Analytics.","To the exponents of the Perennial Philosophy, the question whether Progress is inevitable or even real is not a matter of primary importance. For them, the important thing is that individual men and women should come to the unitive knowledge of the divine Ground, and what interests them in regard to the social environment is not its progressiveness or non-progressiveness (whatever those terms may mean), but the degree to which it helps or hinders individuals in the their advance towards man\'s final end.","Only times and places, only names and ghosts.","I\'m claiming the right to be unhappy.","It\'s with bad sentiments that one makes good novels.","Ultimate Reality is not clearly and immediately apprehended except by those who have made themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit.","Defined in psychological terms, a fanatic is a man who consciously over-compensates a secret doubt.","Words play an enormous part in our lives and are therefore deserving of the closest study.","Knowledge is porportionate to being... You know in virtue of what you are.","The essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything","Why should human females become sterile in their forties, while female crocodiles continue to lay eggs into their third century?","Successfully (whatever that may mean) or unsuccessfully, we all overact the part of our favorite character in fiction.","I dread the inevitable acceleration of American world domination which will be the result of it all...Europe will no longer be Europe.","Some of the greatest advances in mathematics have been due to the invention of symbols, which it afterwards became necessary to explain; from the minus sign proceeded the whole theory of negative quantities.","It isn\u2019t only art that is incompatible with happiness, it\u2019s also science. Science is dangerous, we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled.","Cant is always rather nauseating; but before we condemn political hypocrisy, let us remember that it is the tribute paid by men of leather to men of God, and that the acting of the part of someone better than oneself may actually commit one to a course of behavior perceptibly less evil than what would be normal and natural in an avowed cynic.","All urbanization, pushed beyond a certain point, automatically becomes suburbanization.... Every great city is just a collection of suburbs. Its inhabitantsdo not live in their city; they merely inhabit it.","There are so many intellectual and moral angels battling for rationalism, good citizenship, and pure spirituality; so many and such eminent ones, so very vocal and authoritative! The poor devil in man needs all the support and advocacy he can get. The artist is his natural champion. When an artist deserts to the side of the angels, it is the most odious of treasons.","The snapshots had become almost as dim as memories.","It is because we don\'t know who we are, because we are unaware that the Kingdom of Heaven is within us, that we behave in the generally silly, the often insane, the sometimes criminal ways that are so characteristically human. We are saved, we are liberated and enlightened, by perceiving the hitherto unperceived good that is already within us, by returning to our eternal ground and remaining where, without knowing it, we have always been.","Sleep is the most blessed and blessing of all natural graces.","Henry\'s universe was modeled on the highball. It was a mixture in which half a pint of the fizziest philosophical and scientific ideas all but drowned a small jigger of immediate experience, most of it strictly sexual. Broken reeds are seldom good mixers. They\'re far too busy with their ideas, their sensuality and their psychosomatic complaints to be able to take an interest in other people - even their own wives and children. They live in a state of the most profound voluntary ignorance, not knowing anything about anybody, but abounding in preconceived opinions about everything.","It is delightful to read on the spot the impressions and opinions of tourists who visited a hundred years ago, in the vehicles and with the aesthetic prejudices of the period, the places which you are visiting now. The voyage ceases to be a mere tour through space; you travel through time and thought as well.","Given a fair chance, human beings can govern themselves, and govern themselves better","The rush to books and universities is like the rush to the public house. People want to drown their realization of the difficulties of living properly in this grotesque contemporary world, they want to forget their own deplorable inefficiency as artists in life.","Sunsets and death; death and therefore kisses, kisses and consequently birth and then death for yet another generation of sunset watchers.","Art and religion, carnivals and saturnalia, dancing and listening to oratory - all these have served, in H. G. Wells\'s phrase, as Doors in the Wall.","Try LSD, 100mg intramuscular... I thought so.","The investigation of nature is an infinite pasture-ground where all may graze, and where the more bite, the longer the grass grows, the sweeter is its flavor, and the more it nourishes.","\\"Consider the matter dispassionately, Mr. Foster, and you will see that no offence is so heinous as unorthodoxy of behaviour. Murder kills only the individual- and after all, wha is an individual? \\". . . .\\" We can make a new one with the greatest of ease- as many as we like. Unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of a mere individual; it strikes at Society itself.\\"","The gods are just. No doubt. But their code of law is dictated, in the last resort, by the people who organize society; Providence takes its cue from men.","In any race between human numbers and natural resources, time is against us.","For particulars, as everyone knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers but fretsawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society.","Along this particular stretch of line no express had ever passed. All the trains--the few that there were--stopped at all the stations. Denis knew the names of those stations by heart. Bole, Tritton, Spavin Delawarr, Knipswich for Timpany, West Bowlby, and, finally, Camlet-on-the-Water.","Under the present dispensation, the great majority of factories are little despotisms, benevolent in some cases, malevolent in others. Even where benevolence prevails, passive obedience is demanded by the workers, who are ruled by overseers, not of their own election, but appointed from above. In theory they may be the subjects of a democratic state; but in practice they spend the whole of their working lives as the subjects of a petty tyrant.","I was born wandering between two worlds, one dead, the other powerless to be born, and have made, in a curious way, the worst of both.","To those who think that liberty is a good thing, and that it may someday be possible for people to live in a society fit for free, fully human individuals, a thorough education in the nature of language, its uses and abuses, seems indispensable.","Nothing short of everything will really do.","In religion all words are dirty words. Anybody who gets eloquent about Buddha, or God, or Christ, ought to have his mouth washed out with carbolic soap.","Blood of the world, time staunchless flows; The wound is mortal and is mine.","The scent organ was playing a delightfully refreshing Herbal Capriccio - rippling arpeggios of thyme and lavender, of rosemary, basil, myrtle, tarragon; a series of daring modulations through the spice keys into ambergris; and a slow return through sandalwood, camphor, cedar and newmown hay (with occasional subtle touches of discord - a whiff of kidney pudding, the faintest suspicion of pig\'s dung) back to the simple aromatics with which the piece began. The final blast of thyme died away; there was a round of applause; the lights went up.","Of the significant and pleasurable experiences of life only the simplest are open indiscriminately to all. The rest cannot be had except by those who have undergone a suitable training.","When an artist deserts to the side of the angels, it is the most odious of treasons.","Chaos and ineptitude are anti-human; but so too is a superlatively efficient government, equipped with all the products of a highly developed technology.","Thought must be divided against itself before it can come to any knowledge of itself.","Of course the Dharma-body of the Buddha was the hedge at the bottom of the garden.  At the same time, and no less obviously, it was these flowers, it was anything that I - or rather the blessed Not-I  - cared to look at.","Good action and thoughts produce consequences which tend to neutralize, or put a stop to, the result of evil thoughts and actions. For as we give up the life of self (and note that, like forgiveness, repentance and humility are also special cases of giving), as we abandon what the German mystics called \\"the I, me, mine,\\" we make ourselves progressively capable of receiving grace. By grace we are enabled to know reality more completely, and this knowledge of reality helps us to give up more of the life of selfhood - and so on, in a mounting spiral of illumination and regeneration.","Work is prayer. Work is also stink. Therefore stink is prayer.","Since Mozart\'s day composers have learned the art of making music throatily and palpitatingly sexual.","From the internal reality, by which I means the totality of psychological experiences, it [science] actually separates us. Art, for example, deals with many more aspects of this internal reality than does science, which confines itself deliberately and by convention to the study of one very limited class of experiences the experiences of sense.","Her cheeks were flushed. She caught hold of the Savage\'s arm and pressed it, limp, against her side. He looked down at her for a moment, pale, pained, desiring, and ashamed of his desire. He was not worthy, not... Their eyes for a moment met. What treasures hers promised! A queen\'s ransom of temperament. Hastily he looked away, disengaged his imprisoned arm. He was obscurely terrified lest she should cease to be something he could feel himself unworthy of.","Art, I suppose, is only for beginners, who have made up in their minds to be content with symbols rather than with what they signify, with the elegantly composed recipe in lieu of actual dinner.","They\'re old; they\'re about God hundreds of years ago. Not about God now\\" \\"But God doesn\'t change\\" \\"Men do though","When one individual comes into intimate contact with another, she\u2014or he, of course, as the case may be\u2014must almost inevitably receive or inflict suffering.","Asceticism, it is evident, has a double motivation. If men and women torment their bodies, it is not only because they hope in this way to atone for past sins and avoid future punishments; it is also because they long to visit the mind\'s antipodes and do some visionary sightseeing.","People travel for the same reason as they collect works of art: because the best people do it.","I think we have to prepare the mind in one way or another to accept the great uprush or downrush, whichever you like to call it, of the greater non-self.","A physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. The process, it seemed, was reversible. Mental excess could produce, for its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism.","To make this trivial world sublime, take half a gram of phanerothyme.","Drinking can not be sacramentalised except in religions which set no store on decorum. The worship of Dionysos or the Celtic god of beer was a loud and disorderly affair.","Reality, no matter how utopian, seems to be something people need to frequently take a holiday from.","The horror no less than the charm of real life consists precisely in the recurrent actualization of the inconceivable","There are confessable agonies, sufferings of which one can positively be proud. Of bereavement, of parting, of the sense of sin and the fear of death the poets have eloquently spoken.  They command the world\'s sympathy.  But there are also discreditable anguishes, no less excruciating than the others, but of which the sufferer dare not, cannot speak.  The anguish of thwarted desire, for example.","And along with indifference to space, there was an even more complete indifference to time. \\"There seems to be plenty of it\\", was all I would answer when the investigator asked me to say what I felt about time. Plenty of it, but exactly how much was entirely irrelevant. I could, of course, have looked at my watch but my watch I knew was in another universe. My actual experience had been, was still, of an indefinite duration. Or alternatively, of a perpetual present made up of one continually changing apocalypse.","Happiness has got to be paid for. You\'re paying for it, Mr. Watson\u2013paying because you happen to be too much interested in beauty. I was too much interested in truth; I paid too.","Dying is almost the least spiritual of our acts, more strictly carnal even than the act of love. There are Death Agonies that are like the strainings of the Costive at stool.","\u200e\\"But that\'s the price we have to pay for stability. You\'ve got to choose between happiness and what people used to call high art. We\'ve sacrificed the high art.","I know quite well that one needs ridiculous, mad situations like that; one can\'t write really well about anything else. Why was that old fellow such a marvelous propaganda technician? Because he had so many insane, excruciating things to get excited about. You\'ve got to be hurt and upset; otherwise you can\'t think of the really good, penetrating, X-rayish phrases.","Faith, it is evident, may be relied on to produce sustained action and, more rarely, sustained contemplation.","And what strange voices they have! Sometimes like the complaining of small children; sometimes like the noise of lambs.","Alpha children wear grey. They work much harder than we do, because they\'re so frightfully clever. I\'m awfully glad I\'m a Beta, because I don\'t work so hard. And then we are much better than the Gammas and Deltas. Gammas are stupid. They all wear green, and Delta children wear khaki. Oh no, I don\'t want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They\'re too stupid to be able to read or write. Besides they wear black, which is such a beastly color. I\'m so glad I\'m a Beta.","Unless we choose to decentralize and to use applied science, not as the end to which human beings are to be made the means, but as the means to producing a race of free individuals, we have only two alternatives to choose from: either a number of national","God: a gaseous vertebrate.","No less than war or statecraft, the history of Economics has its heroic ages.","Wild inside; raging, writhing\u2014yes, \\"writhing\\" was the word, writhing with desire. But outwardly he was hopelessly tame; outwardly\u2014baa, baa, baa.","Amour is the one human activity of any importance in which laughter and pleasure preponderate, if ever so slightly, over misery and pain.","We cannot reason ourselves out of our basic irrationality.

Conditions have got to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. When there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended - there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense. But there aren\'t any wars nowadays. The greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving anyone too much. There\'s no such thing as a divided allegiance; you\'re so conditioned that you can\'t help doing what you ought to do. And what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren\'t any temptations to resist. And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there\'s always soma to give you a holiday from the facts.

Belief is the systematic taking of unanalyzed words much too seriously. Paul\'s words, Mohammed\'s words, Marx\'s words, Hitler\'s words---people take them too seriously, and what happens? What happens is the senseless ambivalence of history---sadism versus duty, or (incomparably worse) sadism as duty; devotion counterbalanced by organized paranoia; sisters of charity selflessly tending the victims of their own church\'s inquisitors and crusaders. Faith, on the contrary, can never be taken too seriously.

They did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in our Western capitalist democracies - the development of a vast mass communications industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take into account man\'s almost infinite appetite for distractions.In the past most people never got a chance of fully satisfying this appetite. They might long for distractions, but the distractions were not provided. Christmas came but once a year, feasts were \\"solemn and rare,\\" there were few readers and very little to read, and the nearest approach to a neighborhood movie theater was the parish church, where the performances though frequent, were somewhat monotonous. For conditions even remotely comparable to those now prevailing we must return to imperial Rome, where the populace was kept in good humor by frequent, gratuitous doses of many kinds of entertainment - from poetical dramas to gladiatorial fights, from recitations of Virgil to all-out boxing, from concerts to military reviews and public executions. But even in Rome there was nothing like the non-stop distractions now provided by newspapers and magazines, by radio, television and the cinema. In \\"Brave New World\\" non-stop distractions of the most fascinating nature are deliberately used as instruments of policy, for the purpose of preventing people from paying too much attention to the realities of the social and political situation. The other world of religion is different from the other world of entertainment; but they resemble one another in being most decidedly \\"not of this world.\\" Both are distractions and, if lived in too continuously, both can become, in Marx\'s phrase \\"the opium of the people\\" and so a threat to freedom. Only the vigilant can maintain their liberties, and only those who are constantly and intelligently on the spot can hope to govern themselves effectively by democratic procedures. A society, most of whose members spend a great part of their time, not on the spot, not here and now and in their calculable future, but somewhere else, in the irrelevant other worlds of sport and soap opera, of mythology and metaphysical fantasy, will find it hard to resist the encroachments of those would manipulate and control it.","The more a man knows about himself in relation to every kind of experience, the greater his chance of suddenly, one fine morning, realizing who in fact he is...","You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. . . .

The victim of mind-manipulation does not know that he is a victim. To him the walls of his prison are invisible, and he believes himself to be free.

He could never, poor fellow, have seen a bunch of flowers shining with their own inner light and all but quivering under the pressure of the significance with which they were charged; could never have perceived that what rose and iris and carnation so intensely signified was nothing more, and nothing less, than what they were \u2014 a transience that was yet eternal life, a perpetual perishing that was at the same time pure Being, a bundle of minute, unique particulars in which, by some unspeakable and yet self-evident paradox, was to be seen the divine source of all existence.","Pleasure cannot be shared; like Pain, it can only be experienced or inflicted, and when we give Pleasure to our Lovers or bestow Charity upon the Needy, we do so, not to gratify the object of our Benevolence, but only ourselves.

Find some common desire, some widespread unconscious fear or anxiety; think out some way to relate this wish or fear to the product you have to sell; then build a bridge of verbal or pictorial symbols over which your customer can pass from fact to compensatory dream, and from the dream to the illusion that your product, when purchased, will make the dream come true. They are selling hope. We no longer buy oranges, we buy vitality. We do not just buy an auto, we buy prestige. And so with all the rest. In toothpaste, for example, we buy not a mere cleanser and antiseptic, but release from the fear of being sexually repulsive. In vodka and whisky we are not buying a protoplasmic poison which in small doses, may depress the nervous system in a psychologically valuable way; we are buying friendliness and good fellowship, the warmth of Dingley Dell and the brilliance of the Mermaid Tavern. With our laxatives we buy the health of a Greek god. With the monthly best seller we acquire culture, the envy of our less literate neighbors and the respect of the sophisticated. In every case the motivation analyst has found some deep-seated wish or fear, whose energy can be used to move the customer to part with cash and so, indirectly, to turn the wheels of industry.","I\'m pretty good at inventing phrases- you know, the sort of words that suddenly make you jump, almost as though you\'d sat on a pin, they seem so new and exciting even though they\'re about something hypnopaedically obvious. But that doesn\'t seem enough. It\'s not enough for the phrases to be good; what you make with them ought to be good too...I feel I could do something much more important. Yes, and more intense, more violent. But what? What is there more important to say? And how can one be violent about the sort of things one\'s expected to write about? Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly-they\'ll go through anything. You read them and you\'re pierced. That\'s one of the things I try to teach my students-how to write piercingly. But what on earth\'s the good of being pierced by an article about a Community Sing, or the latest improvement in scent organs? Besides, can you make words really piercing-you know, like the very hardest X-rays when you\'re writing about that sort of thing? Can you say something about nothing?","We are not our own any more than what we possess is our own. We did not make ourselves, we cannot be supreme over ourselves. We are not our own masters.

These may think it a great thing to have everything, as they suppose, their own way\u2013to depend on no one\u2013to have to think of nothing out of sight, to be without the irksomeness of continual acknowledgment, continual prayer, continual reference of what they do to the will of another.

Vain imaginings! That sickness is old age; and a horrible disease it is. They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charms has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play us false\u2013a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. Yes, we inevitably turn to God; for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses.\'\\" Mustapha Mond shut the book and leaned back in his chair. \\"One of the numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn\'t dream about was this\\" (he waved his hand), \\"us, the modern world. \'You can only be independent of God while you\'ve got youth and prosperity; independence won\'t take you safely to the end.\' Well, we\'ve now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. What follows? Evidently, that we can be independent of God. \'The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.\' But there aren\'t any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment is superfluous. And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires, when youthful desires never fail? A substitute for distractions, when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last? What need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity? of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is the social order?","The soul of wit may become the very body of untruth. However elegant and memorable, brevity can never, in the nature of things, do justice to all the facts of a complex situation. On such a theme one can be brief only by omission and simplification. Omission and simplification help us to understand - but help us, in many cases, to understand the wrong thing; for our comprehension may be only of the abbreviator\'s neatly formulated notions, not of the vast, ramifying reality from which these notions have been so arbitrarily abstracted.","Each person is at each moment capable of remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe. The function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being overwhelmed and confused by this mass of largely useless and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive or remember at any moment, and leaving only that very small and special selection which is likely to be practically useful.","Isn\'t there something in living dangerously?","However expressive, symbols can never be the things they stand for.","One can\u2019t have something for nothing. Happiness has got to be paid for. You\u2019re paying for it, Mr. Watson - paying because you happen to be too much interested in beauty.","It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose\u2014 well, you didn\'t know what the result might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes\u2014make them lose their faith in happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere; that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge. Which was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true. But not, in the present circumstance, admissible.","I believe one would write better if the climate were bad. If there were a lot of wind and storms for example...","Mother, monogamy, romance. High spurts the fountain; fierce and foamy the wild jet. The urge has but a single outlet. My love, my baby. No wonder those poor pre-moderns were mad and wicked and miserable. Their world didn\u2019t allow them to take things easily, didn\u2019t allow them to be sane, virtuous, happy. What with mothers and lovers, what with the prohibitions they were not conditioned to obey, what with the temptations and the lonely remorses, what with all the diseases and the endless isolating pain, what with the uncertainties and the poverty\u2014they were forced to feel strongly. And feeling strongly (and strongly, what was more, in solitude, in hopelessly individual isolation), how could they be stable?","In a world where education is predominantly verbal, highly educated people find it all but impossible to pay serious attention to anything but words and notions. There is always money for, there are always doctrines in, the learned foolery of research into what, for scholars, is the all-important problem: Who influenced whom to say what when? Even in this age of technology the verbal humanities are honoured. The non-verbal humanities, the arts of being directly aware of the given facts of our existence, are almost completely ignored.","There are quiet places also in the mind, he said, meditatively. \u201cBut we build bandstand and factories on them. Deliberately\u2014to put a stop to the quietness. We don\u2019t like the quietness. All the thoughts, all the preoccupation in my head\u2014round and round continually.\u201d He made a circular motion with his hands. \u201cAnd the jazz bands, the music hall songs, the boys shouting the news. What\u2019s it all for? To put an end to the quiet, to break it up and disperse it, to pretend at any cost it isn\u2019t there. Ah, but it is, it is there, in spite of everything, at the back of everything. Lying awake at night, sometimes\u2014not restlessly, but serenely, waiting for sleep\u2014the quiet re-establishes itself, piece by piece; all the broken bits, all the fragments of it we\u2019ve been so busily dispersing all day long. It re-establishes itself, an inward quiet, like this outward quiet of grass and trees. It fills one, it grows \u2013a crystal quiet, a growing expanding crystal. It grows, it becomes more perfect; it is beautiful and terrifying, yes, terrifying, as well as beautiful. For one\u2019s alone in the crystal and there\u2019s no support from outside, there\u2019s nothing external and important, nothing external and trivial to pull oneself up by or to stand up, superiorly, contemptuously, so that one can look down. There\u2019s nothing to laugh at or feel enthusiastic about. But the quiet grows and grows. Beautifully and unbearably. And at last you are conscious of something approaching; it is almost a faint sound of footsteps. Something inexpressibly lovely and wonderful advances through the crystal, nearer, nearer. And oh, inexpressibly terrifying. For if it were to touch you, if it were to seize and engulf you, you\u2019d die; all the regular habitual, daily part of you would die. There would be and end of bandstands and whizzing factories, and one would have to begin living arduously in the quiet, arduously n some strange unheard-of manner. Nearer, nearer come the steps; but one can\u2019t face the advancing thing. One daren\u2019t. It\u2019s too terrifying; it\u2019s too painful to die. Quickly, before it is too late, start the factory wheels, bang the drum, blow up the saxophone. Think of the women you\u2019d like to sleep with, the schemes for making money, the gossip about your friends, the last outrage of the politicians. Anything for a diversion. Break the silence, smash the crystal to pieces. There, it lies in bits; it is easily broken, hard to build up and easy to break. And the steps? Ah, those have taken themselves off, double quick. Double quick, they were gone at the flawing of the crystal. And by this time the lovely and terrifying thing is three infinities away, at least. And you lie tranquilly on your bed, thinking of what you\u2019d do if you had ten thousand pounds and of all the fornications you\u2019ll never commit.\u201d","Dualism... Without it there can hardly be good literature. With it, there most certainly can be no good life.","The man who wishes to know the \\"that\\" which is \\"thou\\" may set to work in any one of three ways. He may begin by looking inwards into his own particular thou and, by a process of \\"dying to self\\" --- self in reasoning, self in willing, self in feeling --- come at last to knowledge of the self, the kingdom of the self, the kingdom of God that is within. Or else he may begin with the thous existing outside himself, and may try to realize their essential unity with God and, through God, with one another and with his own being. Or, finally (and this is doubtless the best way), he may seek to approach the ultimate That both from within and from without, so that he comes to realize God experimentally as at once the principle of his own thou and of all other thous, animate and inanimate.","But the nature of the universe is such that the ends never justify the means. On the contrary, the means always determine the end.","Hug me till you drug me, honey; Kiss me till I\'m in a coma: Hug me, honey, snuggly bunny; Love\'s as good as soma.","Man is an intelligence, not served by, but in servitude to his organs.","I don\'t care where I\'m from. Nor where I\'m going. From hell to hell.","Our civilisation being what it is, you\'ve got to spent eight hours out of every twenty-four as a mixture between an imbecile and a sewing machine. It\'s very disagreeable, I know. It\'s humiliating and disgusting. But there you are. You\'ve got to do it, otherwise the whole fabric of our world will fall to bits and we\'ll starve. Do the job then, idiotically and mechanically; and spend your leisure hours in being a real complete man or woman.","That humanity at large will ever be able to dispense with Artificial Paradises seems very unlikely. Most men and women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best so monotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape, the longing to transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and has always been one of the principal appetites of the soul.","One touches and, in the act of touching, one\'s touched.","Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic tradition into whichhe has been born - the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to the accumulated records ofother people\'s experience, the victim in so far as it confirms him in the belief that reduced awareness isthe only awareness and as it bedevils his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his concepts fordata, his words for actual things. That which, in the language of religion, is called \\"this world\\" is theuniverse of reduced awareness, expressed, and, as it were, petrified by language.","It must be something voluntary, something self induced - like getting drunk, or talking yourself into believing some piece of foolishness because it happens to be in the Scriptures. And then look at their idea of what\'s normal. Believe it or not, a normal human being is one who can have an orgasm and is adjusted to society. It\'s unimaginable! No question about what you do with your orgasms. No question about the quality of your feelings and thoughts and perceptions. And then what about the society you\'re supposed to be adjusted to? Is it a mad society or a sane one? And even if it\'s pretty sane, is it right that anybody should be completely adjusted to it?","Science is not enough, religion is not enough, art is not enough, politics and economics is not enough, nor is love, nor is duty, nor is action however disinterested, nor, however sublime, is contemplation. Nothing short of everything will really do.","That so many of the well fed young television-watchers in the world\'s most powerful democracy should be so completely indifferent to the idea of self-government, so blankly uninterested in freedom of thought and the right to dissent, is distressing, but not too surprising. \\"Free as a bird\\", we say, and envy the winged creatures for their power of unrestricted movement in all the three dimensions. But alas, we forget the dodo. Any bird that has learned how to grub up a good living without being compelled to use its wings will soon renounce the privilege of flight and remain forever grounded.","I had motives for not wanting the world to have a meaning; and consequently assumed that it had none, and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying reasons for this assumption. The philosopher who finds no meaning in the world is not concerned exclusively with a problem in pure metaphysics. He is also concerned to prove that there is no valid reason why he personally should not do as he wants to do. For myself, as no doubt for most of my friends, the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation from a certain system of morality. We objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom. The supporters of this system claimed that it embodied the meaning - the Christian meaning, they insisted - of the world. There was one admirably simple method of confuting these people and justifying ourselves in our erotic revolt: we would deny that the world had any meaning whatever.","You can\'t consume much if you sit still and read books.","The urge to escape from selfhood and the environment is in almost everyone almost all the time.","But the man who comes back through the Door in the Wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out. He will be wiser but less cocksure, happier but less self-satisfied, humbler in acknowledging his ignorance yet better equipped to understand the relationship of words to things, of systematic reasoning to the unfathomable Mystery which it tries, forever vainly, to comprehend.","When we feel ourselves to be sole heirs of the universe, when \\"the sea flows in our veins...and the stars are our jewels,\\" when all things are perceived as infinite and holy, what motive can we have for covetousness or self-assertion, for the pursuit of power or the drearier forms of pleasure?","Everyone who knows how to read has it in their power to magnify themselves, to multiply the ways in which they exist, to make their life full, significant, and interesting.","History is the record of what human beings have been impelled to do by their ignorance and the enormous bumptiousness that makes them canonize their ignorance as a political or religious dogma","The urge to transcend self-conscious selfhood is, as I have said, a principal appetite of the soul.","The function of the well-intentioned individual, acting in isolation, is to formulate or disseminate theoretical truths. The function of the well-intentioned individuals in association is to live in accordance with those truths, to demonstrate what happens when theory is translated into practice, to create small-scale working models of the better form of society to which the speculative idealist looks forward.","The end cannot justify the means, for the simple and obvious reason that the means employed determine the nature of the ends produced.","He was a philosopher, if you know what that was.\u2019\u2018A man who dreams of fewer things than there are in heaven and earth,\u2019 said the Savage promptly.\u2018Quite so\u2026","O wonder!\' he was saying; and his eyes shone, his face was brightly flushed. \'How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! ... O brave new world! O brave new world that has such people in it.","To make biological survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funnelled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this particular planet. To formulate and express the contents of this reduced awareness, man has invented and endlessly elaborated those symbol-systems and implicit philosophies which we call languages. Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic tradition into which he or she has been born -- the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to he accumulated records of other people\'s experience, the victim in so far as it confirms him in the belief that reduced awareness is the only awareness and as it be-devils his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his concepts for data, his words for actual things.","I am not so foolish as to equate what happens under the influence of mescalin or of any other drug, prepared or in the future preparable, with the realization of the end and ultimate purpose of human life: Enlightenment, the Beatific Vision. All I am suggesting is that the mescalin experience is what Catholic theologians call \\"a gratuitous grace,\\" not necessary to salvation but potentially helpful and to be accepted thankfully, if made available. To be shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception, to be shown for a few timeless hours the outer and the inner world, not as they appear to an animal obsessed with survival or to a human being obsessed with words and notions, but as they are apprehended, directly and unconditionally, by Mind at Large\u2014this is an experience of inestimable value to everyone and especially to the intellectual.","But God doesn\'t change.\'\'Men do, though.\'\'What difference does that make?\'\'All the difference in the world.","I fell, he repeated for the hundredth time. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t fall very far,\u201d Mary Sarojini now said. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t fall very far,\u201d he agreed. \u201cSo what\u2019s all the fuss about?\u201d the child inquired.\u201d","Then you think there is no God?\\" \\"No, I think there quite probably is one.\\"\\"Then why? \u2026\\" Mustapha Mond checked him. \\"But he manifests himself in different ways to different men.

Permanent crisis justifies permanent control of everybody and everything by the agencies of the central government.","As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom tends compensating to increase. And the dictator (unless he needs cannon fodder and families with which to colonize empty or conquered territories) will do well to encourage that freedom. In conjunction with the freedom to daydream under the influence of dope and movies and the radio, it will help to reconcile his subjects to the servitude which is their fate.","Not quite. I\'m thinking of a queer feeling I sometimes get, a feel that I\'ve got something important to say and the power to say it\u2014only I don\'t know what it is, and I can\'t make any use of the power.","Slowly, very slowly, like two unhurried compass needles, the feet turned towards the right; north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-south-west; then paused, and after a few seconds, turned as unhurriedly back towards the left.

It is that less abundant life, which is lived according to the dictates of the insulated self. It is nature denatured by the distorting spectacles of our appetites and revulsions. It is the finite divorced from the Eternal. It is multiplicity in isolation from its non-dual Ground. It is time apprehended as one damned thing after another. It is a system of verbal categories taking the place of the fathomlessly beautiful and mysterious particulars which constitute reality. It is a notion labelled \'God\'. It is the Universe equated with the words of our utilitarian vocabulary.","Oh you the creator, you the destroyer, you who sustain and make an end,Who in sunlight dance among the birds and the children at their play,Who at midnight dance among corpses in the burning grounds,You Shiva, you dark and terrible Bhairava,You Suchness and Illusion, the Void and All Things,You are the lord of life, and therefore I have brought you flowers;You are the lord of death, and therefore I have brought you my heart\u2014This heart that is now your burning ground.Ignorance there and self shall be consumed with fire.That you may dance, Bhairava, among the ashes.That you may dance, Lord Shiva, in a place of flowers,And I dance with you.","With me, travelling is frankly a vice. The temptation to indulge in it is one which I find almost as hard to resist as the temptation to read promiscuously, omnivorously and without purpose. From time to time, it is true, I make a desperate resolution to mend my ways. I sketch out programmes of useful, serious reading; I try to turn my rambling voyages into systematic tours through the history of art and civilization. But without much success. After a little I relapse into my old bad ways. Deplorable weakness!

They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish \u201cthe illusion of individuality,\u201d but in fact they have been to a great extent deindividualized.

These things are symptoms of political inefficiency. In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic.

Where there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended\u2014there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense. But there aren\'t any wars nowadays. The greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving any one too much. There\'s no such thing as a divided allegiance; you\'re so conditioned that you can\'t help doing what you ought to do. And what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren\'t any temptations to resist.","And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt.

Es la sustituci\xf3n de las complejidades de la realidad por simples esquemas intelectuales, o de los desconcertantes movimientos de la vida por la muerte formal y tranquila. Es incomparablemente m\xe1s f\xe1cil saber muchas cosas, por ejemplo, acerca de la historia del arte y tener ideas profundas acerca de la metaf\xedsica y de la sociolog\xeda, que saber intuitiva y personalmente algo acerca de nuestros semejantes, y llevar relaciones satisfactorias con nuestros amigos y nuestras amantes, nuestra mujer y nuestros hijos. Vivir es mucho m\xe1s dif\xedcil que el s\xe1nscrito, la qu\xedmica o la econom\xeda pol\xedtica. La vida intelectual es un juego de ni\xf1os; lo cual explica el que los intelectuales tiendan a convertirse en ni\xf1os, y luego en imb\xe9ciles, y finalmente, como claramente de muestra la historia pol\xedtica e industrial de los \xfaltimos siglos, en lun\xe1ticos homicidas y bestias salvajes. Las funciones reprimidas no mueren; se deterioran, degeneran, retrogradan al estado primitivo. Pero, entretanto, es mucho m\xe1s f\xe1cil ser un ni\xf1o intelectual, o un lun\xe1tico, o una bestia, que un hombre adulto y armonioso. He ah\xed por qu\xe9, entre otras razones, existe tanta demanda de educaci\xf3n superior. Las gentes se abalanzan hacia los libros y las universidades como hacia los caf\xe9s.

Los libros y las conferencias son mejores para ahogar las penas que la bebida y la fornicaci\xf3n: no dejan dolor de cabeza, ni aquella desesperante sensaci\xf3n del post coitum triste.\xbb","Whenever the masses seized political power, then it was happiness rather than truth and beauty that mattered.","The political merchandisers appeal only to the weak\xadnesses of voters, never to their potential strength. They make no attempt to educate the masses into becoming fit for self-government; they are content merely to manipulate and exploit them. For this pur\xadpose all the resources of psychology and the social sciences are mobilized and set to work. Carefully se\xadlected samples of the electorate are given \\"interviews in depth.\\" These interviews in depth reveal the uncon\xadscious fears and wishes most prevalent in a given so\xadciety at the time of an election. Phrases and images aimed at allaying or, if necessary, enhancing these fears, at satisfying these wishes, at least symbolically, are then chosen by the experts, tried out on readers and audiences, changed or improved in the light of the information thus obtained. After which the political campaign is ready for the mass communicators. All that is now needed is money and a candidate who can be coached to look \\"sincere.\\" Under the new dispen\xadsation, political principles and plans for specific action have come to lose most of their importance. The person\xadality of the candidate and the way he is projected by the advertising experts are the things that really mat\xadter. In one way or another, as vigorous he-man or kindly father, the candidate must be glamorous. He must also be an entertainer who never bores his audience. Inured to television and radio, that audience is accustomed to being distracted and does not like to be asked to con\xadcentrate or make a prolonged intellectual effort. All speeches by the entertainer-candidate must therefore be short and snappy. The great issues of the day must be dealt with in five minutes at the most -- and prefera\xadbly (since the audience will be eager to pass on to something a little livelier than inflation or the H-bomb) in sixty seconds flat. The nature of oratory is such that there has always been a tendency among politicians and clergymen to over-simplify complex is\xadsues. From a pulpit or a platform even the most con\xadscientious of speakers finds it very difficult to tell the whole truth. The methods now being used to merchan\xaddise the political candidate as though he were a deo\xaddorant positively guarantee the electorate against ever hearing the truth about anything.","No, give me the past. It doesn\u2019t change; it\u2019s all there in black and white, and you can get to know about it comfortably and decorously and, above all, privately - by reading. \u2026 As reading becomes more and more habitual and widespread, an ever-increasing number of people will discover that books will give them all the pleasures of social life and none of its intolerable tedium.","The problems raised by alcohol and tobacco cannot, it goes without saying, be solved by prohibition. The universal and ever-present urge to self-transcendence is not to be abolished by slamming the currently popular Doors in the Wall. The only reasonable policy is to open other, better doors in the hope of inducing men and women to exchange their old bad habits for new and less harmful ones.","Among this bewildering multiplicity of ideals which shall we choose? The answer is that we shall choose none. For it is clear that each one of these contradictory ideals is the fruit of particular social circumstances. To some extent, of course, this is true of every thought and aspiration that has ever been formulated. Some thoughts and aspirations, however, are manifestly less dependent on particular social circumstances than others. And here a significant fact emerges: all the ideals of human behaviour formulated by those who have been most successful in freeing themselves from the prejudices of their time and place are singularly alike. Liberation from prevailing conventions of thought, feeling and behaviour is accomplished most effectively by the practice of disinterested virtues and through direct insight into the real nature of ultimate reality. (Such insight is a gift, inherent in the individual; but, though inherent, it cannot manifest itself completely except where certain conditions are fulfilled. The principal pre-condition of insight is, precisely, the practice of disinterested virtues.) To some extent critical intellect is also a liberating force. But the way in which intellect is used depends upon the will. Where the will is not disinterested, the intellect tends to be used (outside the non-human fields of technology, science or pure mathematics) merely as an instrument for the rationalization of passion and prejudice, the justification of self-interest. That is why so few even of die acutest philosophers have succeeded in liberating themselves completely from the narrow prison of their age and country. It is seldom indeed that they achieve as much freedom as the mystics and the founders of religion. The most nearly free men have always been those who combined virtue with insight.Now, among these freest of human beings there has been, for the last eighty or ninety generations, substantial agreement in regard to the ideal individual. The enslaved have held up for admiration now this model of a man, now that; but at all times and in all places, the free have spoken with only one voice.It is difficult to find a single word that will adequately describe the ideal man of the free philosophers, the mystics, the founders of religions. \'Non-attached* is perhaps the best. The ideal man is the non-attached man. Non-attached to his bodily sensations and lusts. Non-attached to his craving for power and possessions. Non-attached to the objects of these various desires. Non-attached to his anger and hatred; non-attached to his exclusive loves.Non-attached to wealth, fame, social position. Non-attached even to science, art, speculation, philanthropy. Yes, non-attached even to these. For, like patriotism, in Nurse Cavel\'s phrase, \'they are not enough, Non-attachment to self and to what are called \'the things of this world\' has always been associated in the teachings of the philosophers and the founders of religions with attachment to an ultimate reality greater and more significant than the self. Greater and more significant than even the best things that this world has to offer. Of the nature of this ultimate reality I shall speak in the last chapters of this book. All that I need do in this place is to point out that the ethic of non-attachment has always been correlated with cosmologies that affirm the existence of a spiritual reality underlying the phenomenal world and imparting to it whatever value or significance it possesses.","Words - I wonder if you can realize how much I love them.

Work may be prayer; but it\'s also hiding one\'s head in the sand, it\'s also making such a din and a dust that a man can\'t hear himself speak or see his own hand before his face. It\'s hiding yourself from yourself. No wonder the Samuel Smileses and the big business men are such enthusiasts for work. Work gives them the comforting illusion of existing, even of being important. If they stopped working, they\'d realize that they simply weren\'t there at all, most of them. Just holes in the air, that\'s all. Holes with perhaps a rather nasty smell in them. Most Smilesian souls must smell rather nasty, I should think. No wonder they daren\'t stop working. They might find out what they really are, or rather aren\'t. It\'s a risk they haven\'t the courage to take.","A pity, he thought, as he signed his name. It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose-well, you didn\u2019t know what the result might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes-make them lose their faith in happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere, that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge.

Reading is a private, not a collective activity. The writer speaks only to indi\xadviduals, sitting by themselves in a state of normal sobriety.

They are at his mercy and, if he knows his business, he can do what he likes with them.","Thus, it is a political axiom that power follows property. But it is now a historical fact that the means of production are fast becoming the monopolistic property of Big Business and Big Government. Therefore, if you believe in democracy, make arrangements to distribute property as widely as possible. Or take the right to vote. In principle, it is a great privilege. In practice, as recent history has repeatedly shown, the right to vote, by itself, is no guarantee of liberty. Therefore, if you want to avoid dictatorship by referendum, break up modern society\'s merely functional collectives into self-governing, voluntarily co-operating groups, capable of functioning outside the bureaucratic systems of Big Business and Big Government.","We can never dispense with language and the other symbol systems; for it is by means of them, and only by their means, that we have raised ourselves above the brutes, to the level of human beings. But we can easily become the victims as well as the beneficiaries of these systems. We must learn how to handle words effectively; but at the same time we must preserve and, if necessary, intensify our ability to look at the world directly and not through that half opaque medium of concepts, which distorts every given fact into the all too familiar likeness of some generic label or explanatory abstraction.","I found myself all at once on the brink of panic. This, I suddenly felt, was going too far. Too far, even though the going was into intenser beauty, deeper significance. The fear, as I analyze it in retrospect, was of being overwhelmed, of disintegrating under a pressure of reality greater than a mind, accustomed to living most of the time in a cosy world of symbols, could possibly bear. The literature of religious experience abounds in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming those who have come, too suddenly, face to face with some manifestation of the Mysterium tremendum. In theological language, this fear is due to the in-compatibility between man\'s egotism and the divine purity, between man\'s self-aggravated separateness and the infinity of God. Following Boehme and William Law, we may say that, by unregenerate souls, the divine Light at its full blaze can be apprehended only as a burning, purgatorial fire. An almost identical doctrine is to be found in The Tibetan Book of the Dead, where the departed soul is described as shrinking in agony from the Pure Light of the Void, and even from the lesser, tempered Lights, in order to rush headlong into the comforting darkness of selfhood as a reborn human being, or even as a beast, an unhappy ghost, a denizen of hell. Anything rather than the burning brightness of unmitigated Reality\u2014anything!","Space was still there; but it had lost its predominance.

A rich and living peace.","The doctrine that God can be incarnated in human form is found in most of the principal historic expositions of the Perennial Philosophy\u2014in Hinduism, in Mahayana Buddhism, in Christianity and in the Mohammedanism of the Sufis, by whom the Prophet was equated with the eternal Logos. When goodness grows weak, When evil increases, I make myself a body. In every age I come back To deliver the holy, To destroy the sin of the sinner, To establish righteousness. He who knows the nature Of my task and my holy birth Is not reborn When he leaves this body; He comes to Me. Flying from fear, From lust and anger, He hides in Me, His refuge and safety. Burnt clean in the blaze of my being, In Me many find home. Bhagavad Gita","Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain.

Vain imaginings! That sickness is old age; and a horrible disease it is.They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charms has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play us false-a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. Yes, we inevitably turn to God; for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses.\u201d\u2019 Mustapha Mond shut the book and leaned back in his chair. \u201cOne of the numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn\u2019t dream about was this\u201d (he waved his hand), \u201cus, the modern world. \u2019You can only be independent of God while you\u2019ve got youth and prosperity; independence won\u2019t take you safely to the end.\u2019 Well, we\u2019ve now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. What follows? Evidently, that we can be independent of God. \u2019The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.\u2019 But there aren\u2019t any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment is superfluous. And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires, when youthful desires never fail? A substitute for distractions, when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last? What need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity? of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is the social order?\u201d","Our world is in a bad way, and it looks as though it would be impossible to rescue it from its present plight, much less improve it, except by deliberate planning.

Where there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended\u2013there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense. But there aren\'t any wars nowadays. The greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving any one too much. There\'s no such thing as a divided allegiance; you\'re so conditioned that you can\'t help doing what you ought to do. And what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren\'t any temptations to resist. And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there\'s always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. And there\'s always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are.

Our business is to wake up. We have to find ways in which to detect the whole of reality in the one illusory part which our self-centered consciousness permits us to see. We must not live thoughtlessly, taking our illusion for the complete reality, but at the same time we must not live too thoughtfully in the sense of trying to escape from the dream state. We must continually be on our watch for ways in which we may enlarge our consciousness. We must not attempt to live outside the world, which is given to us, but we must somehow learn how to transform it and transfigure it. Too much \'wisdom\' is as bad as too little wisdom, and there must be no magic tricks. We must learn to come to reality without the enchanter\'s wand and his book of the words.

The rays crossed and recrossed, making exquisite patterns of such beauty that they left me breathless\u2026. Then, suddenly, my consciousness was lighted up from within and I saw in a vivid way how the whole universe was made up of particles of material which, no matter how dull and lifeless they might seem, were nevertheless filled with this intense and vital beauty.

D. Broad, \u201cthat we should do well to consider much more seriously than we have hitherto been inclined to do the type of theory which Bergson put forward in connection with memory and sense perception. The suggestion is that the function of the brain and nervous system and sense organs is in the main eliminative and not productive. Each person is at each moment capable of remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe. The function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being overwhelmed and confused by this mass of largely useless and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive or remember at any moment, and leaving only that very small and special selection which is likely to be practically useful. According to such a theory, each one of us is potentially Mind at Large. But in so far as we are animals, our business is at all costs to survive. To make biological survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this particular planet. To formulate and express the contents of this reduced awareness, man has invented and endlessly elaborated those symbol-systems and implicit philosophies which we call languages.\u201d","The politics of those whose goal is beyond time are always pacific; it is the idolaters of past and future, of reactionary memory and Utopian dream, who do the persecuting and make the wars.","Good ends, as I have frequently to point out, can be achieved only by the employment of appropriate means.

But there is in debauchery something so intrinsically dull, something so absolutely and hopelessly dismal, that it is only the rarest beings, gifted with much less than the usual amount of intelligence and much more than the usual intensity of appetite, who can go on actively enjoying a regular course of vice or continue actively to believe in its wickedness. Most habitual debauchees are debauchees not because they enjoy debauchery, but because they are uncomfortable when deprived of it. Habit converts luxurious enjoyments into dull and daily necessities. The man who has formed a habit of women or gin, of opium-smoking or flagellation, finds it as difficult to live without his vice as to live without bread and water, even though the actual practice of the vice may have become in itself as unexciting as eating a crust or drinking a glass from the kitchen tap. Habit is as fatal to a sense of wrong-doing as to active enjoyment. After a few years the converted or sceptical Jew, the Westernized Hindu, can eat their pork and beef with an equanimity which to their still-believing brothers seems brutally cynical. It is the same with the habitual debauchee. Actions which at first seemed thrilling in their intrinsic wickedness become after a certain number of repetitions morally neutral. A little disgusting, perhaps; for the practice of most vices is followed by depressing physiological reactions; but no longer wicked, because so ordinary. It is difficult for a routine to seem wicked.","He can go about his business, so completely satisfied to see and be part of the divine Order of Things that he will never even be tempted.

They point out, for example, that democracy can be hardly expected to flourish in societies where political and economic power is being progressively concentrated and centralized.But the progress of technology has led and is still leading to just such a concentration and centralisation of power.As the machinery of mass production is made more efficient it tends to become more complex and more expensive - and so less available to the eterpriser of limited means. Moreover, mass production cannot work without mass distribution; but mass distribution raises problems which only the largest producers can satisfactorily solve. In a world of mass production and mass distribution the Little Man, with his inadequate stock of working capital, is at a grave disadvantage. In competition with Big Man, he loses his money and finally his very existence as an independent producer; the Big Man has grobbled him up.

Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish \u201cthe illusion of individuality,\u201d but in fact they have been to a great extent deindividualized.

The fact is not at all surprising. The cultivated and the mentally active have an insatiable appetite for novelty, diversity and distraction. But the saints, however commanding their talents and whatever the nature of their professional activities, are all incessantly preoccupied with only one subject\u2014spiritual Reality and the means by which they and their fellows can come to the unitive knowledge of that Reality. And as for their actions\u2014these are as monotonously uniform as their thoughts; for in all circumstances they behave selflessly, patiently and with indefatigable charity. No wonder, then, if the biographies of such men and women remain unread. For one well educated person who knows anything about William Law there are two or three hundred who have read Boswell\u2019s life of his younger contemporary. Why? Because, until he actually lay dying, Johnson indulged himself in the most fascinating of multiple personalities; whereas Law, for all the superiority of his talents was almost absurdly simple and single-minded. Legion prefers to read about Legion. It is for this reason that, in the whole repertory of epic, drama and the novel there are hardly any representations of true theocentric saints.","Mass communication, in a word, is neither good nor bad; it is simply a force and, like any other force, it can be used either well or ill.

All his statements are made without qualification. There are no grays in his picture of the world; everything is either diabolically black or celestially white. In Hitler\u2019s words, the propagandist should adopt \u201ca systematically one-sided attitude towards every problem that has to be dealt with. He must never admit that he might be wrong or that people with a different point of view might be even partially right. Opponents should not be argued with; they should be attacked, shouted down, or, if they become too much of a nuisance, liquidated.

These types of males were \\"boys who can\'t read, won\'t learn, don\'t get on with anyone, and finally turn to the more violent forms of delinquency.\\" He uses Adolf Hitler as an archetype of this phenomenon:[15] A Peter Pan if ever there was one. Hopeless at school. Incapable either of competing or co- operating. Envying all the normally successful boys\u2014and, because he envied, hating them and, to make himself feel better, despising them as inferior beings. Then came the time for puberty. But Adolf was sexually backward. Other boys made advances to girls, and the girls responded. Adolf was too shy, too uncertain of his manhood. And all the time incapable of steady work, at home only in the compensatory Other World of his fancy. There, at the very least, he was Michelangelo. Here, unfortunately, he couldn\'t draw. His only gifts were hatred, low cunning, a set of indefatigable vocal cords and a talent for nonstop talking at the top of his voice from the depths of his Peter-Panic paranoia. Thirty or forty million deaths and heaven knows how many billions of dollars\u2014that was the price the world had to pay for little Adolf\'s retarded maturation.","As a victim, the Savage possessed, for Bernard, this enormous superiority over the others: that he was accessible.

The rock was like bleached bones in the moonlight. Down in the valley, the coyotes were howling at the moon. The bruises hurt him, the cuts were still bleeding; but it was not for pain that he sobbed; it was because he was all alone, because he had been driven out, alone, into this skeleton world of rocks and moonlight. At the edge of the precipice he sat down. The moon was behind him; he looked down into the black shadow of the mesa, into the black shadow of death. He had only to take one step, one little jump.. He held out his right hand in the moonlight. From the cut on his wrist the blood was still oozing. Every few seconds a drop fell, dark, almost colourless in the dead light. Drop, drop, drop.

Let us now consider examples of planning by political leaders who accept the ideal postulates, whose intentions are good. The first thing to notice is that none of these men accepts the ideal postulates whole-heartedly. All believe that desirable ends can be achieved by undesirable means. Aiming to reach goals diametrically opposed to those of Fascism, they yet persist in taking the same roads as are taken by the Duces and Fuehrers. They are pacifists, but pacifists who act on the theory that peace can be achieved by means of war; they are reformers and revolutionaries, but reformers who imagine that unfair and arbitrary acts can produce social justice, revolutionaries who persuade themselves that the centralization of power and the enslavement of the masses can result in liberty for all. Revolutionary Russia has the largest army in the world; a secret police, that for ruthless efficiency rivals the German or the Italian; a rigid press censorship; a system of education that, since Stalin \\"reformed\\" it, is as authoritarian as Hitler\'s; an all-embracing system of military training that is applied to women and children as well as men; a dictator as slavishly adored as the man-gods of Rome and Berlin; a bureaucracy, solidly entrenched as the new ruling class and employing the powers of the state to preserve its privileges and protect its vested interests; an oligarchical party which dominates the entire country and within which there is no freedom even for faithful members. (Most ruling castes are democracies so far as their own members are concerned. Not so the Russian Communist Party, in which the Central Executive Committee acting through the Political Department, can override or altogether liquidate any district organization whatsoever.) No opposition is permitted in Russia. But where opposition is made illegal, it automatically goes underground and becomes conspiracy. Hence the treason trials and purges of 1936 and 1937. Large-scale manipulations of the social structure are pushed through against the wishes of the people concerned and with the utmost ruthlessness. (Several million peasants were deliberately starved to death in 1933 by the Soviet planners.) Ruthlessness begets resentment; resentment must be kept down by force. As usual the chief result of violence is the necessity to use more violence. Such then is Soviet planning-well-intentioned, but making use of evil means that are producing results utterly unlike those which the original makers of the revolution intended to produce.","That which besets me is indifference. I can\'t be bothered about people. Or rather, won\'t. For I avoid, carefully, all occasions for being bothered... Indifference is a form of sloth, and sloth in its turn is one of the symptoms of loveless-ness. One isn\'t lazy about what one loves. The problem is: how to love?","On the levels of politics and theology, beauty is perfectly compatible with nonsense and tyranny. Which is very fortunate; for if beauty were incompatible with non\xadsense and tyranny, there would be precious little art in the world. The masterpieces of painting, sculpture and architecture were produced as religious or political propaganda, for the greater glory of a god, a govern\xadment or a priesthood. But most kings and priests have been despotic and all religions have been riddled with superstition. Genius has been the servant of tyranny and art has advertised the merits of the local cult. Time, as it passes, separates the good art from the bad meta\xadphysics. Can we learn to make this separation, not after the event, but while it is actually taking place? That is the question.","Do you think Gandhi was interested in Art?\\" I asked.\\"Gandhi? No, of course not.\\"\\"I think you\'re right,\\" I agreed. \\"Neither in art nor in science. And that is why we killed him.\\"\\"We?\\"\\"Yes, we. The intelligent, the active, the forward-looking, the believers in Order and Perfection. Whereas Gandhi was a reactionary who believed only in people. Squalid little individuals governing themselves, village by village, and worshiping the Brahman who is also Atman. It was intolerable. No wonder we bumped him off.\\"But even as I spoke I was thinking that that wasn\'t the whole story. The whole story included an inconsistency, almost a betrayal. This man who believed only in people had got himself involved in the sub-human mass-madness of nationalism, in the would-be superhuman, but actually diabolic, institution of the nation-state. He got himself involved in these things, imagining that he could mitigate the madness and convert what was satanic in the state to something like humanity. But nationalism and the politics of power had proved too much for him. It is not at the center, not from within the organization, that the saint can cure our regimented insanity; it is only from without, at the periphery. If he makes himself a part of the machine, in which the collective madness is incarnated, one or the other of two things is bound to happen. Either he remains himself, in which case the machine will use him as long as it can and, when he becomes unusable, reject or destroy him. Or he will be transformed into the likeness of the mechanism with and against which he works, and in this case we shall see Holy Inquisitions and alliances with any tyrant prepared to guarantee ecclesiastical privileges.","You can only be independent of God while you\'ve got youth and prosperity; independence won\'t take you safely to the end.","I mean what does a democracy depend on? A democracy depends on the individual voter making an intelligent and rational choice for what he regards as his enlightened self-interest, in any given circumstance.","To most people any radical change is even more odious than cynicism.

For, of course, poor Hansen\'s case wasn\'t in any way unique; on a smaller scale, and therefore with less power to do evil, he was acting like all those civil servants and statesmen and prelates who go through life spreading misery and destruction in the name of their ideals and under orders from their categorical imperatives.","Simplicity is no virtue unless you are potentially complicated.","It\u2019s dark because you are trying too hard.

Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn\u2019t nearly so spectacular as instability.

And that\'s the point of our chewing-grace - to make the me more conscious of what the not-me is up to.","Thought is crude, matter unimaginably subtle.","No man can concentrate his attention upon evil, or even upon the idea of evil, and remain unaffected. To be more against the devil than for God is exceedingly dangerous. Every crusader is apt to go mad. He is haunted by the wickedness which he attributes to his enemies; it becomes in some sort a part of him.Possession is more often secular than supernatural. Men are possessed by their thoughts of a hated person, a hated class, race or nation. At the present time the destinies of the world are in the hands of self-made demoniacs - of men who are possessed by, and who manifest, the evil they have chose to see in others. They do not believe in devils; but they have tried their hardest to be possessed - have tried and been triumphantly successful. And since they believe even less in God than in the devil, seems very unlikely that they will ever be able to cure themselves of their possession. Concentrating his attention upon the idea of a supernatural uncommon among secular demoniacs.

(It is worth noting in this context that reforms carried out under the stimulus of the fear of violence from foreign neighbours and with the aim of using violence more efficiently in future international wars are just as likely to be self-stultifying in the long run as reforms which cannot be enforced except by a domestic terror. The dictators have made many large-scale changes in the structure of societies they govern without having had to resort to terrorism. The population gave consent to these changes because it had been persuaded by means of intensive propaganda that they were necessary to make the country safe against \\"foreign aggression.\\" Some of these changes have been in the nature of desirable reforms; but in so far as they were calculated to make the country more efficient as a war-machine, they tended to provoke other countries to increase their military efficiency and so to make the coming of war more profitable. But the nature of modern was is such that it is unlikely that any desirable reform will survive the catastrophe. Thus it will be seen that intrinsically desirable reforms, accepted without opposition, may yet be self-stultifying if the community is persuaded to accept them by means of propaganda that plays upon its fear of future violence on the part of others, or stresses the glory of future violence on the part of others, or stresses the glory of future violence when successfully used by itself.) Returning to our main theme, which is the need for avoiding domestic violence during the application of reforms, we see that a reform may be intrinsically desirable, but so irrelevant to the existing historical circumstances as to be practically useless. This does not mean that we should make the enormous mistake committed by Hegel and gleefully repeated by every modern tyrant with crimes to justify and follies to rationalize-the mistake that consists in affirming that the real is the rational, that the historical is the same as the ideal. The real is not the rational; and whatever is, is not right. At any given moment of history, the real, as we know it, contains certain elements of the rational, laboriously incorporated into its structure by patient human effort; among the things that are, some are righter than others.","By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies\u2014all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable.

At any other time I would have seen a chair barred with alternate light and shade. Today the percept had swallowed up the concept.

Of that which, at twenty feet, even at arm\u2019s length, looked and sounded like a human being no trace remains.Something analogous happens to the myopic artist and the happy lover. In the nuptial embrace personality is melted down; the individual (it is the recurrent theme of Lawrence\u2019s poems and novels) ceases to be himself and becomes a part of the vast impersonal universe.And so it is with the artist who chooses to use his eyes at the near point.

Maniacally, the mother brooded over her children (her children) \u2026 brooded over them like a cat over its kittens; but a cat that could talk, a cat that could say, \\"My baby, my baby,\\" over and over again. \\"My baby, and oh, oh, at my breast, the little hands, the hunger, and that unspeakable agonizing pleasure!

A moment of clear and complete knowledge of what we think we are, but in fact are not, puts a stop, for a moment, to the Manichean charade. If we renew, until they become a continuity, these moments of the knowledge of what we are not, we may find ourselves, all of a sudden, knowing who in fact we are.","Take one sexually inept wage slave, she went on, \u201cone dissatisfied female, two or (if preferred) three small television addicts; marinate in a mixture of Freudism and dilute Christianity; then bottle up tightly in a four-room flat and stew for fifteen years in their own juice.

The Savage violently started and, uncovering his face, looked round. Five khaki twins, each with the stump of a long eclair in his right hand, and their identical faces variously smeared with liquid chocolate, were standing in a row, puggily goggling at him.  They met his eyes and simultaneously grinned.

Success went fizzily to Bernard\'s head, and in the process completely reconciled him (as any good intoxicant should do) to a world which, up till then, he had found very unsatisfactory. In so far as it recognized him as important, the order of things was good. But, reconciled by his success he yet refused to forgo the privilege of criticizing this order. For the act of criticizing heightened his sense of importance, made him feel larger. Moreover, he did genuinely believe that there were things to criticize. (At the same time, he genuinely liked being a success and having all the girls he wanted.) Before those who now, for the sake of the Savage, paid their court to him, Bernard would parade a carping unorthodoxy. He was politely listened to. But behind his back people shook their heads. \'That young man will come to a bad end,\' they said, prophesying the more confidently in that they themselves would in due course personally see to it that the end was bad. \'He won\'t find another Savage to help him out a second time,\' they said. Meanwhile, however, there was the first Savage; they were polite. And because they were polite, Bernard felt positively gigantic - gigantic and at the same time light with elation, lighter than air.","Many seeds had fallen in the stony places of his spirit, to spring luxuriantly up into stalky plants and wither again because they had no deepness of earth; many had been sown there and had died, since his mother scattered the seeds of the wild flowers","So far as they\'re concerned, the physical fronts don\'t exist.

Brutality toward members of an alien race is justified by arguments drawn from what may once have passed for Science. Once universal, brutality toward the insane is not yet extinct - the mad are horribly exasperating. But this brutality is no longer rationalized, as it was in the past, in theological terms. The people who tormented Surin and the other victims of hysteria or psychosis did so, first, because they enjoyed being brutal and, second, because they were convinced that they did well to be brutal. And they believed that they did well, because, ex hypthesi, the mad had always brought their own troubles upon themselves.

Death--and he drove in his spade once, and again, and yet again. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools they way to dusty death. A convincing thunder rumbled through the words. He lifted another spadeful of earth. Why had Linda died? Why had she been allowed to become gradually less than human and at last... He shuddered. A good kissing carrion. He planted his foot on his spade and stamped it fiercely into the tough ground. As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kills us for their sport. Thunder again; words that proclaimed themselves true--truer somehow than truth itself. And yet that same Gloucester had called them ever-gentle gods.

We do not say, I see a roundish mass of delicately shaded reds and pinks. We immediately pass from the actual experience to the concept.","Science? The Savage frowned. He knew the word. But what it exactly signified he could not say. Shakespeare and the old men of the pueblo had never mentioned science, and from Linda he had only gathered the vaguest hints: science was something you made helicopters with, some thing that caused you to laugh at the Corn Dances, something that prevented you from being wrinkled and losing your teeth. He made a desperate effort to take the Controller\'s meaning.\\"Yes,\\" Mustapha Mond was saying, \\"that\'s another item in the cost of stability. It isn\'t only art that\'s incompatible with happiness; it\'s also science.

Would he ever be able to call his brain his own? Was there, indeed, anything in it that was truly his own, or was it simply an education?","But meanwhile it\'s much easier to be an intellectual child or lunatic or beast than a harmonious adult man. That\'s why (among other reasons) there\'s such a demand for higher education. The rush to books and universities is like the rush to the public-house. People want to drown their realization of the difficulties of living properly in this grotesque contemporary world, they want to forget their own deplorable inefficiency as artists in life.","Philip was silent. These discussions of personal relations always made him uncomfortable. They threatened his solitude - that solitude which, with a part of his mind, he deplored (for he felt himself cut off from much he would have liked to experience), but in which alone he felt himself free. At ordinary times he took this inward solitude for granted, as one accepts the atmosphere in which one lives. But when it was menaced, he became only too painfully aware of its importance to him; he fought for it, as a choking man fights for air. But it was a fight without violence, a negative battle of retirement and defence.","Everything\'s incredible, if you can skin off the crust of obviousness our habits put on it. Every object and event contains within itself an infinity of depths within depths.","Ford\'s in his flivver; all\'s well with the world.","In regard to propaganda the early advocates of universal literacy and a free press envisaged only two possibilities: the propaganda might be true, or it might be false. They did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in our Western capitalist democracies\u2014the development of a vast mass communications industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take into account man\'s almost infinite appetite for distractions.","I\u2019d rather be myself, he said. \u201cMyself and nasty. Not somebody else, however jolly.\u201d \u201cA\u201d","The essential Not-self could be perceived very clearly in things and in livingcreatures on the hither side of good and evil. In human beings it was visible only when they were inrepose, their minds untroubled, their bodies motionless.","When the brain runs out of sugar, the undernourished ego grows weak, can\u2019t be bothered to undertake the necessary chores, and loses all interest in those spatial and temporal relationships which mean so much to an organism bent on getting on in the world. As Mind at Large seeps past the no longer watertight valve, all kinds of biologically useless things start to happen. In some cases there may be extra-sensory perceptions. Other persons discover a world of visionary beauty. To others again is revealed the glory, the infinite value and meaningfulness of naked existence, of the given, unconceptualized event. In the final stage of egolessness there is an \u201cobscure knowledge that All is in all\u2014that All is actually each. This is as near, I take it, as a finite mind can ever come to \u201cperceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe.\u201d","Medical science has made such tremendous progress that there is hardly a healthy man left.","The fact of shame is significant. We feel spontaneously ashamed of the body and its activities. That\'s a sign of the body\'s absolute and natural inferiority.\' \'Absolute and natural rubbish!\' said Rampion indignantly.\'shame isn\'t spontaneous, to begin with. It\'s artificial, it\'s acquired. You can make people ashamed of anything. Agonizingly ashamed of wearing brown boots with a black coat, or speaking with the wrong sort of accent, or having a drop at the end of their noses. Of absolutely anything, including the body and its functions. But that particular shame\'s just as artificial as any other. The Christians invented it, just as the tailors in Savile Row invented the shame of wearing brown boots with a black coat. There was precious little of it before Christian times. Look at the Greeks, the Etruscans.","Silence is as full of potential wisdom and wit as the unshown marble of great sculpture.","Pilkington, at Mombasa, had produced individuals who were sexually mature at four and full grown at six and a half. A scientific triumph. But socially useless. Six-year-old men and women were too stupid to do even Epsilon work. And the process was an all-or-nothing one; either you failed to modify at all, or else you modified the whole way. They were still trying to find the ideal compromise between adults of twenty and adults of six. So far without success. Mr Foster sighed and shook his head.","Is it true that human beings are nothing but the products of their social environment? And if it is not true, what justification can there be for maintaining that the individual is less important than the group of which he is a member?","Una de las principales funciones de nuestros amigos estriba en sufrir (en formas m\xe1s suaves y simb\xf3licas) los castigos que querr\xedamos infligir, y no podemos, a nuestros enemigos.","The best that can be said for ritualistic legalism is that it improves conduct.

It\'s appalling; in living people, one is dealing with unknown and unknowable quantities. One can only hope to find out anything about them by a long series of the most disagreeable and boring human contacts, involving a terrible expense of time. It\'s the same with current events; how can I find out anything about them except by devoting years to the most exhausting first-hand study, involving once more an endless number of the most unpleasant contacts? No, give me the past. It doesn\'t change; it\'s all there in black and white, and you can get to know about it comfortably and decorously and, above all, privately\u2014by reading.","I\u2019ll MAKE you be free whether you want to or not.\u2019-The Savage","Pentru mine, urm\u0103 el, func\u021bia principal\u0103 a artei este aceea de a transmite cuno\u0219tin\u021be.

Physically and mentally, each one of us is unique.

We seem to have wandered rather a long way from that.\u2019 \u2018Well, as a matter of fact,\u2019 said Philip, \u2018we haven\u2019t. All these camisoles en flanelle and pickled onions and bishops of cannibal islands are really quite to the point. Because the essence of the new way of looking is multiplicity. Multiplicity of eyes and multiplicity of aspects seen. For instance, one person interprets events in terms of bishops; another in terms of the price of flannel camisoles; another, like that young lady from Gulmerg,\u2019 he nodded after the retreating group, \u2018thinks of it in terms of good times. And then there\u2019s the biologist, the chemist, the physicist, the historian. Each sees, professionally, a different aspect of the event, a different layer of reality.

We take it all for granted; but the moment you start thinking, it becomes queer. And the more you think, the queerer it grows. That\u2019s what I want to get in this book\u2014the astonishingness of the most obvious things. Really any plot or situation would do. Because everything\u2019s implicit in anything. The whole book could be written about a walk from Piccadilly Circus to Charing Cross. Or you and I sitting here on an enormous ship in the Red Sea. Really, nothing could be queerer than that. When you reflect on the evolutionary processes, the human patience and genius, the social organisation, that have made it possible for us to be here, with stokers having heat apoplexy for our benefit and steam turbines doing five thousand revolutions a minute, and the sea being blue, and the rays of light not flowing round obstacles, so that there\u2019s a shadow, and the sun all the time providing us with energy to live and think\u2014when you think of all this and a million other things, you must see that nothing could well be queerer and that no picture can be queer enough to do justice to the facts.\u2019 \u2018All the same,\u2019 said Elinor, after a long silence, \u2018I wish one day you\u2019d write a simple straightforward story about a young man and a young woman who fall in love and get married and have difficulties, but get over them, and finally settle down.\u2019 \u2018Or","Each one of us is potentially Mind at Large.

Very early in his manhood he had discovered that not only did he not feel sympathy for the poor, the weak, the diseased, and deformed; he actually hated them. Once, as an undergraduate, he spent three days at a mission in the East End. He had returned, filled with a profound and ineradicable disgust. Instead of pitying, he loathed the unfortunate. It was not, he knew, a very comely emotion; and he had been ashamed of it at first. In the end he had decided that it was temperamental, inevitable, and had felt no further qualms.

It was the first dictatorship in the present period of modern technical developement, a dicttorship which made complete use of all technical means for the domination of its own country. Through technical devices like the radio and the loud-speaker, eighty million people were deprived of independent thought. It was thereby possible to subject them to the will of one man....Earlier dictators needed highly qualified assistants even at the lowest level \u2013 men who could think and act independently. The totalirian system in the period of modern technical development can dispense with such men; thanks to modern methods of communication, i tis possible to mechanize the lower leadership. As a result of this there has arisen the new type of uncritical recipient of orders.\u201c (Albert Speer)","In the bourgeois democratic countries the need for using intrinsically good means to achieve desirable ends is more clearly realized than in Russia. But even in these countries enormous mistakes have been made in the past and still greater, still more dangerous mistakes are in process of being committed today. Most of these mistakes are due to the fact that, though professing belief in our ideal postulates, the rulers and people of these countries are, to some extent and quite incompatibly, also militarists and nationalists. The English and the French, it is true, are sated militarists whose chief desire is to live a quiet life, holding fast to what they seized in their unregenerate days of imperial highway-robbery. Confronted by rivals who want to do now what they were doing from the beginning of the eighteenth to the end of the nineteenth century, they profess and doubtless genuinely feel a profound moral indignation. Meanwhile, they have begun to address themselves, reluctantly but with determination, to the task of beating the Fascist powers at their own game. Like the Fascist states, they are preparing for war. but modern war cannot be waged or even prepared except by a highly centralized executive wielding absolute power over a docile people. Most of the planning which is going on in the democratic countries is planning designed to transform these countries into the likeness of totalitarian communities organized for slaughter and rapine. Hitherto this transformation has proceeded fairly slowly. Belief in our idea postulates has acted as a brake on fascization, which has had to advance gradually and behind a smoke screen. But if war is declared, or even if the threat of war becomes more serious than at present, the process will become open and rapid. \\"The defence of democracy against Fascism\\" entails inevitably the transformation of democracy into Fascism.","We merely ask them,\\" Mrs Narayan answered with a smile, \\"to attept the impossible.

He sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page: \u201cThe author\u2019s mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious, but heretical and, so far as the present social order is concerned, dangerous and potentially subversive. Not to be published.\u201d He underlined the words. \u201cThe author will be kept under supervision. His transference to the Marine Biological Station of St. Helena may become necessary.\u201d A pity, he thought, as he signed his name. It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose\u2014well, you didn\u2019t know what the result might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes\u2014make them lose their faith in happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere; that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge. Which was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true. But not, in the present circumstance, admissible.\u201d","No, you accept the world, and you make use of it; you make use of everything you do, of everything that happens to you, of all the things you see and hear and taste and touch, as so many means to your liberation from the prison of yourself.","its not what happens to you it\'s what you do with what happens you","As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom tends compensatingly to increase.

For at twenty-seven, after two years of advanced theology and philosophy, young Father Grandier received his reward for so many long semesters of diligence and good behavior. By the Company of Jesus, in whose gift it lay, he was presented to the important living of Saint-Pierre du March\xe9 at Loudun. At the same time, and thanks to the same benefactors, he was made a canon of the collegial church of the Holy Cross. His foot was on the ladder; all he now had to do was to climb. Loudun, as its new parson rode slowly toward his destination, revealed itself as a little city on a hill, dominated by two tall towers\u2014the spire of St. Peter\u2019s and the medieval keep of the great castle. As a symbol, as a sociological hieroglyph, Loudun\u2019s skyline was somewhat out of date. That spire still threw its Gothic shadow across the town; but a good part of the townspeople","Hay dos clases de propaganda: la propaganda racional a favor de la acci\xf3n que est\xe1 de acuerdo con el ilustrado inter\xe9s propio de quienes la hacen y de aquellos a quienes est\xe1 dirigida, y la propaganda no racional que no est\xe1 de acuerdo con el inter\xe9s propio de nadie, sino que est\xe1 dictada, y excitada, por pasiones, ciegos impulsos e inconscientes ansias y temores.

Kabir That this insight into the nature of things and the origin of good and evil is not confined exclusively to the saint, but is recognized obscurely by every human being, is proved by the very structure of our language. For language, as Richard Trench pointed out long ago, is often \u201cwiser, not merely than the vulgar, but even than the wisest of those who speak it. Sometimes it locks up truths which were once well known, but have been forgotten. In other cases it holds the germs of truths which, though they were never plainly discerned, the genius of its framers caught a glimpse of in a happy moment of divination. For example, how significant it is that in the Indo-European languages, as Darmsteter has pointed out, the root meaning \u201ctwo\u201d should connote badness. The Greek prefix dys- (as in dyspepsia) and the Latin dis- (as in dishonorable) are both derived from \u201cduo.\u201d The cognate bis- gives a pejorative sense to such modern French words as b\xe9vue (\u201cblunder,\u201d literally \u201ctwo-sight\u201d). Traces of that \u201csecond which leads you astray\u201d can be found in \u201cdubious,\u201d \u201cdoubt\u201d and Zweifel\u2014for to doubt is to be double-minded. Bunyan has his Mr. Facing-both-ways, and modern American slang its \u201ctwo-timers.\u201d Obscurely and unconsciously wise, our language confirms the findings of the mystics and proclaims the essential badness of division\u2014a word, incidentally, in which our old enemy \u201ctwo\u201d makes another decisive appearance.\u201d","The greater a man\u2019s talents, the greater his power to lead astray.

Recent developments in Russia and recent advances in science and technology have robbed Orwell\u2019s book of some of its gruesome verisimilitude. A nuclear war will, of course, make nonsense of everybody\u2019s predictions. But, assuming for the moment that the Great Powers can somehow refrain from destroying us, we can say that it now looks as though the odds were more in favor of something like Brave New World than of something like 1984.","I ate civilization. It poisoned me; I was defined. And then, I ate my own wickedness.","It\'s dark because you\'re trying too hard. Dark because you want it to be light. Remember what you used to tell me when I was a little girl. \'Lightly, child, lightly. You\'ve got to learn to do everything lightly. Think lightly, act lightly, feel lightly. Yes, feel lightly, even though you\'re feeling deeply. Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them.\' [...] So throw away all your baggage and go forward.

Disciplining himself in the cause, he has attained the result and abides in the samadhi (contemplation) of Emptiness for ever so many aeons. However enlightened in this way, the Sravaka is not at all on the right track. From the point of view of the Bodhisattva, this is like suffering the torture of hell. The Sravaka has buried himself in Emptiness and does not know how to get out of his quiet contemplation, for he has no insight into the Buddha-nature itself. Mo Tsu When Enlightenment is perfected, a Bodhisattva is free from the bondage of things, but does not seek to be delivered from things. Samsara (the world of becoming) is not hated by him, nor is Nirvana loved. When perfect Enlightenment shines, it is neither bondage nor deliverance.

To this new-born Not-self, the behavior, the appearance, the very thought of the self it had momentarily ceased to be, and of other selves, its one-time fellows, seemed not indeed distasteful (for distastefulness was not one of the categories in terms of which I was thinking), but enormously irrelevant.\u201d","Reason is not the same in all men; human beings belong to a variety of psychological types separated one from another by irreducible differences.","Let there be a voice to assure them, by day and even while they are asleep, that in spite of all the terror, all the bewilderment and confusion, the ultimate Reality remains unshakably itself and is of the same substance as the inner light of even the most cruelly tormented mind.","Human beings were not, as the eighteenth-century philosophers supposed, wise and virtuous: they were apes.","Feeling are communicated by means of ideas, which are their intellectual equivalent; at the sound of the words conveying the ideas the appropriate emotion is evoked.","\u2014Porque es antiguo; \xe9sta es la raz\xf3n principal.

What the effects of its general discovery by all? Miller laughed. \'It will have exactly as much or as little effect as people want it to have.

Sabbaths were celebrated four times a year - on Candlemass Day, February 2nd, on Rood Mass Day, May 1st, on Lammas Day, August 1st, and on the eve of All Hallows, October 31st. These were great festivals, often attended by hundreds of devotees, who came from considerable distances. Between Sabbaths there were weekly \\"Esbats\\" from small congregations in the village where the ancient religion was still practiced. At all high Sabbaths the devil himself was invariably present, in the person of some man who had inherited, or otherwise acquired, the honor of being the incarnation of the two-faced god of the Dianic cult. The worshipers paid homage to the god by kissing his reverse face - a mask worn, beneath an animal\'s tail, on the devil\'s backside. There was then, for some at least of the female devotees, a ritual copulation with the god, who was equipped for this purpose with an artificial phallus of horn or metal. This ceremony was followed by a picnic (for the Sabbaths were celebrated out of doors, near sacred trees or stones), by dancing and finally by a promiscuous sexual orgy that had, no doubt, originally been a magical operation for increasing the fertility of the animals on which primitive hunters and herdsmen depend for their livelihood. The prevailing atmosphere at the Sabbaths was one of good fellowship and mindless, animal joy. When captured and brought to trial, many of the who had taken part in the Sabbath resolutely refused, even under torture, even at the stake, to abjure the religion which had brought them so much happiness.","We need not know a thing in order to be able to investigate and control it.

In those brief moments the whole secret of the world is revealed to me. I perceive that the supreme quality in the human soul is effrontery. Genius in the man of action is simply the apotheosis of charlatanism. Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Mr. Gladstone, Lloyd George\u2014what are they? Just ordinary human beings projected through the magic lantern of a prodigious effrontery and so magnified to a thousand times larger than life. Look at me. I am far more intelligent than any of these fabulous figures; my sensibility is more refined than theirs, I am morally superior to any of them.

But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charms has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play us false -- a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. Yes, we inevitably turn to God; for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses.","One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.

The bride of a monarch, in her husband\u2019s chamber, hath no such causes of delight as you. You never enjoy the world aright till the sea itself floweth in your veins, till you are clothed with the heavens and crowned with the stars; and perceive yourself to be the sole heir of the whole world, and more than so, because men are in it who are every one sole heirs as well as you. Till you can sing and rejoice and delight in God, as misers do in gold, and kings in sceptres, you can never enjoy the world. Till your spirit filleth the whole world, and the stars are your jewels; till you are as familiar with the ways of God in all ages as with your walk and table; till you are intimately acquainted with that shady nothing out of which the world was made; till you love men so as to desire their happiness with a thirst equal to the zeal of your own; till you delight in God for being good to all; you never enjoy the world. Till you more feel it than your private estate, and are more present in the hemisphere, considering the glories and the beauties there, than in your own house; till you remember how lately you were made, and how wonderful it was when you came into it; and more rejoice in the palace of your glory than if it had been made today morning. Yet further, you never enjoyed the world aright, till you so love the beauty of enjoying it, that you are covetous and earnest to persuade others to enjoy it. And so perfectly hate the abominable corruption of men in despising it that you had rather suffer the flames of hell than willingly be guilty of their error. The world is a mirror of Infinite Beauty, yet no man sees it. It is a Temple of Majesty, yet no man regards it. It is a region of Light and Peace, did not men disquiet it. It is the Paradise of God. It is more to man since he is fallen than it was before. It is the place of Angels and the Gate of Heaven. When Jacob waked out of his dream, he said, God is here, and I wist it not.

First of all, our social arrangements offer them very few opportunities for bullying their families, and our political arrangements make it practically impossible for them to domineer on any larger scale. Second, we train the Muscle Men to be aware and sensitive, we teach them to enjoy the commonplaces of everyday existence. This means that they always have an alternative\u2014innumerable alternatives\u2014to the pleasure of being the boss.

The function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being overwhelmed and confused by this mass of largely useless and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive or remember at any moment, and leaving only that very small and special selection which is likely to be practically useful. According to such a theory, each one of us is potentially Mind at Large.","But I don\'t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness, I want sin.","Totalitarian regimes justify their existence by means of a philosophy of political monism, according to which the state is God on earth, unification under the heel of the divine state is salvation, and all means to such unification, however intrinsically wicked, are right and may be used without scruple. This political monism leads in practice to excessive privilege and power for the few and oppression for the many, to discontent at home and war abroad. But excessive privilege and power are standing trmptations to pride, greed, vanity and cruelty; oppression results in fear and envy; war breeds hatred, misery and despair. All such negative emotions are fatal to the spiritual life. Only the pure in heart and poor in spirit can come to the Knowledge of God. Hence, the attempt to impose more unity upon societies then their individual members are ready for makes it psychologically almost impossible for those individuals to realize they are unity with the divine Ground [of being] and with one another.","I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness, I want sin.","And in effect the sultry darkness into which the students now followed him was visible and crimson, like the darkness of closed eyes on a summer\u2019s afternoon.","Mind at Large has to be funnelled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system.

Mr. Scogan read it aloud:","All right then, said the savage defiantly, \u201cI\u2019m claiming the right to be unhappy.\u201d","In the contemporary world there are two classes of bad plans-the plans invented and put into practice by men who do not accept our ideal postulates, and the plans invented and put into practice by the men who accept them, but imagine that the ends proposed by the prophets can be achieved by wicked or unsuitable means. Hell is paved with good intentions, and it is probable that plans made by well-meaning people of the second class may have results no less disastrous than plans made by evil-intentioned people of the first class. Which only shows, yet once more, how right the Buddha was in classing unawareness and stupidity among the deadly sins. Let us consider a few examples of bad plans belonging to these two classes. In the first class we must place all Fascist and all specifically militaristic plans. Fascism, in the words of Mussolini, believes that \\"war alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have the courage to meet it.\\" Again, \\"a doctrine which is founded upon the harmful postulate of peace is hostile to Fascism.\\" The Fascist, then, is one who believes that the bombardment of open towns with fire, poison and explosives (in other words, modern war) is intrinsically good. He is one who rejects the teaching of the prophets and believes that the best society is a national society living in a state of chronic hostility towards other national societies and preoccupied with ideas of rapine and slaughter. He is one who despises the non-attached individual and holds up for admiration the person who, in obedience to the boss who happens at the moment to have grabbed political power, systematically cultivates all the passions (pride, anger, envy, hatred) which the philosophers and the founders of religions have unanimously condemned as the most maleficent, the least worthy of human beings. All fascist planning has one ultimate aim: to make the national society more efficient as a war machine. Industry, commerce and finance are controlled for this purpose. The manufacture of substitutes is encouraged in order that the country may be self-sufficient in time of war. Tariffs and quotas are imposed, export bounties distributed, exchanges depreciated for the sake of gaining a momentary advantage or inflicting loss upon some rival. Foreign policy is conducted on avowedly Machiavellian principles; solemn engagements are entered into with the knowledge that they will be broken the moment it seems advantageous to do so; international law is invoked when it happens to be convenient, repudiated when it imposes the least restraint on the nation\'s imperialistic designs. Meanwhile the dictator\'s subjects are systematically educated to be good citizens of the Fascist state. Children are subjected to authoritarian discipline that they may grow up to be simultaneously obedient to superiors and brutal to those below them. On leaving the kindergarten, they begin that military training which culminates in the years of conscription and continues until the individual is too decrepit to be an efficient soldier. In school they are taught extravagant lies about the achievements of their ancestors, while the truth about other peoples is either distorted or completely suppressed. the press is controlled, so that adults may learn only what it suits the dictator that they should learn. Any one expressing un-orthodox opinions is ruthlessly persecuted. Elaborate systems of police espionage are organized to investigate the private life and opinions of even the humblest individual. Delation is encouraged, tale-telling rewarded. Terrorism is legalized. Justice is administered in secret; the procedure is unfair, the penalties barbarously cruel. Brutality and torture are regularly employed.","If one\u2019s different, one\u2019s bound to be lonely.","The meditative eye can look through any single object and see, as through a window, the entire cosmos.","Music \u2018says\u2019 things about the world, but in specifically musical terms.

Yes, chosen. For it had been an act of the will. If it were all nonsense or a joke, then he was at liberty to read his books and exercise his talents for sarcastic comment; there was no reason why he shouldn\'t sleep with any presentable woman who was ready to sleep with him. If it weren\'t nonsense, if there was some significance, then he could no longer live irresponsibly. There were duties towards himself and others and the nature of things. Duties with whose fulfilment the sleeping and the indiscriminate reading and the habit of detached irony would interfere. He had chosen to think it nonsense, and nonsense for more than twenty years the thing had seemed to be \u2013 nonsense, in spite of occasional uncomfortable intimations that there might be a point, and that the point was precisely in what he had chosen to regard as the pointlessness, the practical joke.","(A dervish was tempted by the devil to cease calling upon Allah, on the ground that Allah never answered, \u201cHere am I.

And he might be hundreds of other people too. Might be? He certainly was. He was aunts and cousins she hardly ever saw; grandfathers and great-uncles she had only known as a child and utterly forgotten; ancestors who had died long ago, back to the beginning of things.

In man who can work all day at the office without undue fatigue of the eyes is worn out by an hour at the museum and comes home with a splitting headache. Why? Because in the office he is following a regular routine and looking at words and figures, the bike of which he looks at every day; whereas in the museum everything is strange novel, and outlandish.","Only the most ingeniously optimistic, the most wilfully blind to the facts of history and psychology, can believe that paper guarantees of liberty - guarantees wholly unsupported by the realities of political and economic power - will be scrupulously respected by those who have known only the facts of governmental omnipotence on the one hand and, on the other, of mass dependence upon, and consequently subservience to, the state and its representatives.","In the field of mass communications as in almost every other field of enterprise, technological progress has hurt the Little Man and helped the Big Man. As lately as fifty years ago, every democratic country could boast of a great number of small journals and local newspapers. Thousand of country editors expressed thousands of independent opinions. Somewhere or other almost anybody could get almost anything printed. Today the press is still legally free; but most of the little papers have disappeared. The cost of wood-pulp, of modern printing machinery and of syndicated news is too high for the Little Man. In the totalitarian East there is political censorship, and the media of mass communication are controlled by the State. In the democratic West there is economic censorship and the media of mass communication are controlled by members of the Power Elite. Censorship by rising costs and the concentration of communication power in the hands of a few big concerns is less objectionable than State ownership and government propaganda; but certainly it is not something of which a Jeffersonian democrat could possibly approve.","\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0639\u0646 \u063a\u064a\u0631\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0648\u062d\u0629 \u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u060c \u0648\u062d\u064a\u0646\u0626\u0630 \u064a\u0642\u0633\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645","The impersonal forces of over-population and over-organization, and the social engineers who are trying to direct these forces, are pushing us in the direction of a new medieval system.","Public health and social reform are the indispensable preconditions of any kind of general enlightenment","The individual,\\" he began in a soft and sadly philosophical tone, \\"is not a self-supporting universe.

I do muscular work, because I have muscles; and if I don\u2019t use my muscles I shall become a bad-tempered sitting-addict.","Mustapha Mond paused, put down the first book and, picking up the other, turned over the pages. \u201cTake this, for example, he said, and in his deep voice once more began to read: \u201c \u2018A man grows old; he feels in himself that radical sense of weakness, of listlessness, of discomfort, which accompanies the advance of age; and, feeling thus, imagines himself merely sick, lulling his fears with the notion that this distressing condition is due to some particular cause, from which, as from an illness, he hopes to recover. Vain imaginings! That sickness is old age; and a horrible disease it is. They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charms has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play us false\u2014a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. Yes, we inevitably turn to God; for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses.\u2019 \u201d Mustapha Mond shut the book and leaned back in his chair. \u201cOne of the numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn\u2019t dream about was this\u201d (he waved his hand), \u201cus, the modern world. \u2018You can only be independent of God while you\u2019ve got youth and prosperity; independence won\u2019t take you safely to the end.\u2019 Well, we\u2019ve now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. What follows? Evidently, that we can be independent of God. \u2018The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.\u2019 But there aren\u2019t any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment is superfluous. And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires, when youthful desires never fail? A substitute for distractions, when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last? What need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity? of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is the social order?\u201d","Consider the matter dispassionately, Mr. Foster, and you will see that no offence is so heinous as unorthodoxy of behaviour.

When they are heard, they should enable the hearer to understand this meaning, and this according to the four categories of substance, of activity, of quality and of relationship. For example cow and horse belong to the category of substance. He cooks or he prays belongs to the category of activity. White and black belong to the category of quality. Having money or possessing cows belongs to the category of relationship. Now there is no class of substance to which the Brahman belongs, no common genus. It cannot therefore be denoted by words which, like \u201cbeing in the ordinary sense, signify a category of things.

(Alternatively, he may be presumed to be the recipient of extraordinary graces; for in many instances divine and infernal miracles are, most unhappily, identical. The levitation of saintly ecstatic is distinguishable from the levitation of ecstatics demoniacs only in virtue of the moral antecedents and consequences of the event.

I want danger. I want freedom. I want goodness. I want sin.","It is man\'s intelligence that makes him so often behave more stupidly than the beasts. ... Man is impelled to invent theories to account for what happens in the world. Unfortunately, he is not quite intelligent enough, in most cases, to find correct explanations. So that when he acts on his theories, he behaves very often like a lunatic. Thus, no animal is clever enough, when there is a drought, to imagine that the rain is being withheld by evil spirits, or as punishment for its transgressions. Therefore you never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. No horse, for example would kill one of its foals to make the wind change direction. Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies. Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat\'s meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, intelligent enough.","that is the secret of happiness and virtue\u2014liking what you\u2019ve got to do.

Actual happiness always pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn\'t nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt.

For of course some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work intelligently--though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy members of society, as possible.

With fitted, harmonious words the magicians summoned rabbits out of empty hats and spirits from the elements. Their descendants, the literary men, still go on with the process, morticing their verbal formulas together, and, before the power of the finished spell, trembling with delight and awe. Rabbits out of empty hats? No, their spells are more subtly powerful, for they evoke emotions out of empty minds. Formulated by their art the most insipid statements become enormously significant. For example, I proffer the constatation, \'Black ladders lack bladders.\' A self-evident truth, one on which it would not have been worth while to insist, had I chosen to formulate it in such words as \'Black fire-escapes have no bladders,\' or, \'Les echelles noires manquent de vessie.\' But since I put it as I do, \'Black ladders lack bladders,\' it becomes, for all its self-evidence, significant, unforgettable, moving. The creation by word-power of something out of nothing\u2014what is that but magic? And, I may add, what is that but literature?

The vast majority of human beings dislike and even actually dread all notions with which they are not familiar. Trotter, in his admirable Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War, has called them the \'stable-minded,\' and has set over against them a minority of \'unstable-minded people,\' fond of innovation for its own sake.... The tendency of the stable-minded man... will always be to find that \'whatever is, is right.\' Less subject to the habits of thought formed in youth, the unstable-minded naturally take pleasure in all that is new and revolutionary. It is to the unstable-minded that we owe progress in all its forms, as well as all forms of destructive revolution. The stable-minded, by their reluctance to accept change, give to the social structure its durable solidity. There are many more stable- than unstable-minded people in the world (if the proportions were changed we should live in a chaos); and at all but very exceptional moments they possess power and wealth more than proportionate to their numbers. Hence it comes about that at their first appearance innovators have generally been persecuted and always derided as fools and madmen. A heretic, according to the admirable definition of Bossuet, is one who \'emits a singular opinion\'\u2014that is to say, an opinion of his own, as opposed to one that has been sanctified by general acceptance. That he is a scoundrel goes without saying. He is also an imbecile\u2014a \'dog\' and a \'devil,\' in the words of St. Paul, who utters \'profane and vain babblings.\' No heretic (and the orthodoxy from which he departs need not necessarily be a religious orthodoxy; it may be philosophic, ethical, artistic, economic), no emitter of singular opinions, is ever reasonable in the eyes of the stable-minded majority. For the reasonable is the familiar, is that which the stable-minded are in the habit of thinking at the moment when the heretic utters his singular opinion. To use the intelligence in any other than the habitual way is not to use the intelligence; it is to be irrational, to rave like a madman.","Like any other form of imperialism, theological imperialism is a menace to permanent world peace. The reign of violence will never come to an end until, first, most human beings accept the same, true philosophy of life; until, second, this Perennial Philosophy is recognized as the highest factor common to all the world religions; until, third, the adherents of every religion renounce the idolatrous time-philosophies, with which, in their own particular faith, the Perennial Philosophy of eternity has been overlaid; until, fourth, there is a world-wide rejection of all the political pseudo-religions, which place man\'s supreme good in future time and therefore justify and commend the commission of every sort of present iniquity as a means to that end. If these conditions are not fulfilled, no amount of political planning, no economic blue-prints however ingeniously drawn, can prevent the recrudescence of war and revolution.","Perhaps the forces that now menace freedom are too strong to be resisted for very long.

Vain imaginings! That sickness is old age; and a horrible disease it is.They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makesmen turn to religion as they advance in years. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, thereligious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, asthe passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and lessexcitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by theimages, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereuponGod emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards thesource of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave tothe world of sensations its life and charms has begun to leak away from us, nowthat phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from withinor from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, somethingthat will never play us false-a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth.

Technically, it would be perfectly simple to reduce all lower-caste working hours to three or four a day. But would they be any the happier for that? No, they wouldn\'t. The experiment was tried, more than a century and a half ago. The whole of Ireland was put on to the four-hour day. What was the result? Unrest and a large increase in the consumption of soma; that was all.

We should suffer acutely if we were confined in a narrower space. You cannot pour upper-caste champagne-surrogate into lower-caste bottles. It\'s obvious theoretically. But it has also been proved in actual practice. The result of the Cyprus experiment was convincing.\\"\\"What was that?\\" asked the Savage.Mustapha Mond smiled. \\"Well, you can call it an experiment in rebottling if you like. It began in A.F. 473. The Controllers had the island of Cyprus cleared of all its existing inhabitants and re-colonized with a specially prepared batch of twenty-two thousand Alphas. All agricultural and industrial equipment was handed over to them and they were left to manage their own affairs. The result exactly fulfilled all the theoretical predictions. The land wasn\'t properly worked; there were strikes in all the factories; the laws were set at naught, orders disobeyed; all the people detailed for a spell of low-grade work were perpetually intriguing for high-grade jobs, and all the people with high-grade jobs were counter-intriguing at all costs to stay where they were.

A generous extravagance, undreamed of in other parts of the world, is the American rule. Men and women earn largely and spend what they have on the national pleasures, which are all social and stimulative of vitality. Modernity also tends to heighten vitality \u2013 or to be more exact, it affects the expression of vitality, externalising it in the form of vehement action. The joyful acceptance of change, which so profoundly influences American industry, business methods and domestic architecture, reacts on the affairs of daily, personal life. Pleasure is associated with a change of place and environment, finally with mere movement for its own sake. People leave their homes if they want entertainment. They externalise their vitality in visiting places of public amusement, in dancing and motoring \u2013 in doing anything that is not quietly sitting by their own fireside (or rather by their own radiator). What is known as \'night life\' flourishes in America as nowhere else in the world. And nowhere, perhaps, is there so little conversation. In America vitality is given its most obviously vital expression. Hence there appears to be even more vitality in the Americans than perhaps there really is. A man may have plenty of vitality and yet keep still; his motionless calm may be mistaken for listlessness. There can be no mistake about people who dance and rush about. American vitality is always obviously manifested. It expresses itself vigorously to the music of the drum and saxophone, to the ringing of telephone bells and the roar of street cars. It expresses itself in terms of hastening automobiles, of huge and yelling crowds, of speeches, banquets, \'drives,\' slogans, sky signs. It is all movement and noise, like the water gurgling out of a bath down the waste. Yes, down the waste.","La actual felicidad siempre parece muy menguada en comparaci\xf3n con las compensaciones que brinda la miseria.

Because of the essential irrationality of this power, even the best-intentioned of public speakers probably do more harm than good. When an orator, by the mere magic of words and a golden voice, persuades his audience of the rightness of a bad cause, we are very properly shocked. We ought to feel the same dismay whenever we find the same irrelevant tricks being used to persuade people of the rightness of a good cause. The belief engendered may be desirable, but the grounds for it are intrinsically wrong, and those who use the devices of oratory for instilling even right beliefs are guilty of pandering to the least creditable elements in human nature.","In Hitler\u2019s words, the propagandist should adopt \u2018a systematically one-sided attitude towards every problem that has to be dealt with\u2019.

Opponents should not be argued with; they should be attacked, shouted down, or, if they become too much of a nuisance, liquidated.","One of these advantages, as Laubardemont was quick to realize, consisted in this: that it was now possible (through the mouth of a devil who had been duly constrained in the presence of the Sacrament) to flatter the Cardinal in an entirely new and supernatural manner. In the minutes of an exorcism of May 20, 1634, written entirely in Laubardemont\u2019s hand, we read the following: \u201cQuestion: \u2018What do you say about the great Cardinal, the protector of France?\u2019 The devil answered, swearing by the name of God, \u2018He is the scourge of all my good friends.\u2019 Question: \u2018Who are your good friends?\u2019 Answer: \u2018The heretics.\u2019 Question: \u2018What are the other heroic aspects of his person?\u2019 Answer: \u2018His work for the relief of the people, the gift of government, which he has received from God, his desire to preserve peace in Christendom, the single-minded love he bears to the King\u2019s person.\u2019 It was a handsome tribute and, coming as it did, direct from hell, it could be accepted as the simple truth.\u201d","Lo que el hombre ha unido, la Naturaleza no puede separarlo.","LOVE God is love, and there are blessed moments when even to unregenerate human beings it is granted to know Him as love. But it is only in the saints that this knowledge becomes secure and continuous. By those in the earlier stages of the spiritual life God is apprehended predominantly as law. It is through obedience to God the Law-Giver that we come at last to know God the loving Father. The law which we must obey, if we would know God as love, is itself a law of love. \u201cThou shalt love God with all thy soul, and with all thy heart, with all thy mind and with all thy strength. And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. We cannot love God as we should, unless we love our neighbors as we should. We cannot love our neighbors as we should, unless we love God as we should. And, finally, we cannot realize God as the active, all-pervading principle of love, until we ourselves have learned to love Him and our fellow creatures. Idolatry consists in loving a creature more than we love God. There are many kinds of idolatry, but all have one thing in common: namely, self-love. The presence of self-love is obvious in the grosser forms of sensual indulgence, or the pursuit of wealth and power and praise. Less manifestly, but none the less fatally, it is present in our inordinate affections for individuals, persons, places, things, and institutions. And even in men\u2019s most heroic sacrifices to high causes and noble ideals, self-love has its tragic place. For when we sacrifice ourselves to any cause or ideal that is lower than the highest, less than God Himself, we are merely sacrificing one part of our unregenerate being to another part which we and other people regard as more creditable. Self-love still persists, still prevents us from obeying perfectly the first of the two great commandments. God can be loved perfectly only by those who have killed out the subtlest, the most nobly sublimated forms of self-love. When this happens, when we love God as we should and therefore know God as love, the tormenting problem of evil ceases to be a problem, the world of time is seen to be an aspect of eternity, and in some inexpressible way, but no less really and certainly, the struggling, chaotic multiplicity of life is reconciled in the unity of the all-embracing divine charity.\u201d","La actual felicidad siempre parece muy menguada en comparaci\xf3n de las compensaciones que brinda la miseria.

Little Percy, the hero, was never good at games, but he was always clever. He passes through the usual public school and the usual university and comes to London, where he lives among the artists. He is bowed down with melancholy thought; he carries the whole weight of the universe upon his shoulders. He writes a novel of dazzling brilliance; he dabbles delicately in Amour and disappears, at the end of the book, into the luminous Future.\\" Denis blushed scarlet.

But though it may account for the origins, mere tailoring can never explain the luxuriant development of drapery as a major theme of all the plastic arts. Artists, it is obvious, have always loved drapery for its own sake\u2014or, rather, for their own. When you paint or carve drapery, you are painting or carving forms which, for all practical purposes, are non-representational-the kind of unconditioned forms on which artists even in the most naturalistic tradition like to let themselves go. In the average Madonna or Apostle the strictly human, fully representational element accounts for about ten per cent of the whole. All the rest consists of many coloured variations on the inexhaustible theme of crumpled wool or linen. And these non-representational nine-tenths of a Madonna or an Apostle may be just as important qualitatively as they are in quantity. Very often they set the tone of the whole work of art, they state the key in which the theme is being rendered, they express the mood, the temperament, the attitude to life of the artist.","Denis pursued, having ready-made ideas about everything.

They point out, for example, that democracy can hardly be expected to flourish in societies where political and economic power is being progressively concentrated and centralized. But the progress of technology has led and is still leading to just such concentration and centralization of power. As the machinery of mass production is made more efficient it tends to become more complex and more expensive \u2013 and so less available to the enterpriser of limited means. Moreover, mass production cannot work without mass distribution; but mass distribution raises problems which only the largest producers can satisfactorily solve. In a world of mass production and mass distribution the Little Man, with his inadequate stock of working capital, is at a grave disadvantage. In competition with the Big Man, he loses his money and finally his very existence as an independent producer; the Big Man has gobbled him up. As the Little Men disappear, more and more economic power comes to be wielded by fewer and fewer people. Under a dictatorship the Big Business, made possible by advancing technology and the consequent ruin of Little Business, is controlled by the State \u2013 that is to say, by a small group of party leaders and the soldiers, policemen and civil servants who carry out their orders.","el individuo siente, la comunidad se resiente -cit\xf3 Lenina.","Mescalin opens up the way of Mary, but shuts the door on that Martha.

For the intellectual is by definition the man for whom, in Goethe\u2019s phrase, \u2018the word is essentially fruitful.\u2019 He is the man who feels that \u2018what we perceive by the eye is foreign to us as such and need not impress us deeply.\u2019 And yet, though himself an intellectual and one of the supreme masters of language, Goethe did not always agree with his own evaluation of the word. \u2018We talk,\u2019 he wrote in middle life, \u2018far too much. We should talk less and draw more. I personally should like to renounce speech altogether and, like organic Nature, communicate everything I have to say in sketches. That fig tree, this little snake, the cocoon on my window sill quietly awaiting its future \u2013 all these are momentous signatures. A person able to decipher their meaning properly would soon be able to dispense with the written or the spoken word altogether. The more I think of it, there is something futile, mediocre, even (I am tempted to say) foppish about speech. By contrast, how the gravity of Nature and her silence startle you, when you stand face to face with her, undistracted, before a barren ridge or in the desolation of the ancient hills.\u2019 We can never dispense with language and the other symbol systems; for it is by means of them, and only by their means, that we have raised ourselves above the brutes, to the level of human beings. But we can easily become the victims as well as the beneficiaries of these systems. We must learn how to handle words effectively; but at the same time we must preserve and, if necessary, intensify our ability to look at the world directly and not through that half-opaque medium of concepts, which distorts every given fact into the all too familiar likeness of some generic label or explanatory abstraction. Literary or scientific, liberal or specialist, all our education is predominantly verbal and therefore fails to accomplish what it is supposed to do.

Virochana, the demonic being who is the apotheosis of power-loving, extraverted somatotonia, finds it perfectly natural to identify himself with his body, and he goes back to the other Titans to seek a purely material salvation. Incarnated in the present century, Virochana would have been an ardent Communist, Fascist or nationalist. Indra sees through material salvationism and is then offered dreamsalvation, deliverance out of bodily existence into the intermediate world between matter and spirit\u2014that fascinatingly odd and exciting psychic universe, out of which miracles and foreknowledge, \u201cspirit communications and extra-sensory perceptions make their startling irruptions into ordinary life. But this freer kind of individualized existence is still all too personal and ego-centric to satisfy a soul conscious of its own incompleteness and eager to be made whole. Indra accordingly goes further and is tempted to accept the undifferentiated consciousness of deep sleep, of false samadhi and quietistic trance, as the final deliverance. But he refuses, in Brahmananda\u2019s words, to mistake tamas for sattvas, sloth and sub-consciousness for poise and super-consciousness. And so, by discrimination, he comes to the realization of the Self, which is the enlightenment of the darkness that is ignorance and the deliverance from the mortal consequences of that ignorance.\u201d","In the latter half of the twentieth century, two visionary books cast their shadows over our futures.

Y","How have individuals been affected by the technological advances of recent years? Here is the answer to this question given by a philosopher-psychiatrist, Dr. Erich Fromm: Our contemporary Western society, in spite of its material, intellectual and political progress, is increasingly less conducive to mental health, and tends to undermine the inner security, happiness, reason and the capacity for love in the individual; it tends to turn him into an automaton who pays for his human failure with increasing mental sickness, and with despair hidden under a frantic drive for work and so-called pleasure.Our \\"increasing mental sickness\\" may find expression in neurotic symptoms. These symptoms are conspicuous and extremely distressing. But \\"let us beware,\\" says Dr. Fromm, \\"of defining mental hygiene as the prevention of symptoms. Symptoms as such are not our enemy, but our friend; where there are symptoms there is conflict, and conflict always indicates that the forces of life which strive for integration and happiness are still fighting.\\" The really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. \\"Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does.\\" They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish \\"the illusion of individuality,\\" but in fact they have been to a great extent deindividualized. Their conformity is developing into something like uniformity. But \\"uniformity and freedom are incompatible. Uniformity and mental health are incompatible too. ... Man is not made to be an automaton, and if he becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed.","If you go to New South Wales, you will see marsupials hopping about the countryside.

We start as infants in the animal eternity of life in the moment, without anxiety for the future or regret for the past; we grow up into the specifically human condition of those who look before and after, who live to a great extent, not in the present but in memory and anticipation, not spontaneously but by rule and with prudence, in repentance and fear and hope; and we can continue, if we so desire, up and on in a returning sweep towards a point corresponding to our starting place in animality, but incommensurably above it. Once more life is lived in the moment - the life now, not of a sub-human creature, but of a being in whom charity has cast out fear, vision has taken the place of hope, selflessness has put a stop to the positive egotism of complacent reminiscence and the negative egotism of remorse.","How have individuals been affected by the technological advances of recent years? Here is the answer to this question given by a philosopher-psychiatrist, Dr Erich Fromm: \u2018Our contemporary Western society, in spite of its material, intellectual and political progress, is increasingly less conducive to mental health, and tends to undermine the inner security, happiness, reason and the capacity for love in the individual; it tends to turn him into an automaton who pays for his human failure with increasing mental sickness, and with despair hidden under a frantic drive for work and so-called pleasure.\u2019 Our \u2018increasing mental sickness\u2019 may find expression in neurotic symptoms. These symptoms are conspicuous and extremely distressing. But \u2018let us beware\u2019, says Dr Fromm, \u2018of defining mental hygiene as the prevention of symptoms. Symptoms as such are not our enemy, but our friend; where there are symptoms there is conflict, and conflict always indicates that the forces of life which strive for integration and happiness are still fighting.\u2019 The really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. \u2018Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does.\u2019 They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness.","Heaven is merely a vantage point from which the divine Ground can be more clearly seen than on the level of ordinary individualized existence.","Organization is indispensable; for liberty arises and has meaning only within a self-regulating community of freely cooperating individuals. But, though indispensable, organization can also be fatal. Too much organization transforms men and women into automata, suffocates the creative spirit and abolishes the very possibility of freedom. As usual, the only safe course is in the middle, between the extremes of laissez-faire at one end of the sacle and of total control at the other.","O que nos leva por fim - continuou o Sr. Foster - a deixar o dom\xednio da simples imita\xe7\xe3o servil da natureza para entrar no mundo mais interessante da inven\xe7\xe3o humana","Turning to God without turning from self\' - the formula is absurdly simple; and yet, simple as it is, it explains all the follies and iniquities committed in the name of religion.",">>Mein lieber junger Freund<< sagte Mustafa Mannesmann. >>Die Zivilisation hat nicht den geringsten Bedarf an Edelmut oder Heldentum. Die Dinge sind Merkmale politischer Unt\xfcchtigkeit. In einer wohlgeordneten Gesellschaft wie der unseren findet niemand Gelegenheit zu Edelmut und Heldentum. Solche Gelegenheiten ergeben sich nur in ganz ungefestigten Verh\xe4ltnissen. Wo es Kriege gibt, Gewissenskonflikte, Versuchungen, den man widerstehen, und Liebe, die man erk\xe4mpfen oder verteidigen muss - dort haben Heldentum und Edelmut selbstverst\xe4ndlich einen gewissen Sinn.

The Higher Criticism, as it is mockingly called, denies the possibility of miracles, prediction, and real inspiration, and attempts to account for the Bible as a natural development. Slowly but surely, during the last eighty years, the spirit of Infidelity has been robbing the Germans of their Bible and their faith, so that Germany is to-day a nation of unbelievers. Higher Criticism has thus made the war possible; for it would be absolutely impossible for any Christian nation to wage war as Germany is waging it.","Even the poorest government is rich enough to provide its subjects with a substantial measure of death control. Birth control is a very different matter. Death control is something which can be provided for a whole people by a few technicians working in the pay of a benevolent government.

It must be practised by countless individuals, from whom it demands more intelligence and will power than most of the world\u2019s teeming illiterates possess, and (where chemical or mechanical methods of contraception are used) an expenditure of more money than most of these millions can now afford. Moreover, there are nowhere any religious traditions in favour of unrestricted death, whereas religious and social traditions in favour of unrestricted reproduction are widespread.

Here is the answer to this question given by a philosopher-psychiatrist, Dr Erich Fromm: \u2018Our contemporary Western society, in spite of its material, intellectual and political progress, is increasingly less conducive to mental health, and tends to undermine the inner security, happiness, reason and the capacity for love in the individual; it tends to turn him into an automaton who pays for his human failure with increasing mental sickness, and with despair hidden under a frantic drive for work and so-called pleasure.\u2019 Our \u2018increasing mental sickness\u2019 may find expression in neurotic symptoms. These symptoms are conspicuous and extremely distressing. But \u2018let us beware\u2019, says Dr Fromm, \u2018of defining mental hygiene as the prevention of symptoms. Symptoms as such are not our enemy, but our friend; where there are symptoms there is conflict, and conflict always indicates that the forces of life which strive for integration and happiness are still fighting.\u2019 The really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. \u2018Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does.\u2019 They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish \u2018the illusion of individuality\u2019, but in fact they have been to a great extent de-individualized. Their conformity is developing into something like uniformity. But \u2018uniformity and freedom are incompatible. Uniformity and mental health are incompatible too . . . Man is not made to be an automaton, and if he becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed.\u2019 In the course of evolution nature has gone to endless trouble to see that every individual is unlike every other individual. We reproduce our kind by bringing the father\u2019s genes into contact with the mother\u2019s. These hereditary factors may be combined in an almost infinite number of ways. Physically and mentally, each one of us is unique. Any culture which, in the interests of efficiency or in the name of some political or religious dogma, seeks to standardize the human individual, commits an outrage against man\u2019s biological nature.","We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies \u2013 all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes.","The philosophy that rationalizes power politics and justifies war and military training is always (whatever the official religion of the politicians and war makers) some wildly unrealistic doctrine of national, racial or ideological idolatry, having, as its inevitable corollaries, the notions of Herrenvolk and \u201cthe lesser breeds without the Law.","As flores do campo e as paisagens t\xeam um grave defeito: s\xe3o gratuitas.

These were swallowed, irritated the mucous membrane as they passed through the intestine, thus acting as a purgative, and could be recovered from the chamber pot, washed and used again, indefinitely. After the first capital outlay, there was no further need for spending money on cathartics. Dr. Patin might fulminate and the Parlement forbid; but for the costive French bourgeois, the appeal of antimony was irresistible. Perpetual Pills were treated as heirlooms and after passing through one generation were passed on to the next.","Mind, we are told, is nothing but a food-gathering mechanism; con-trolled by unconscious forces, either aggressive or sexual; the product of social and economic pressures; a bundle of conditioned reflexes.All this is quite true so far as it goes; quite false if it goes no further. For obviously, if mind is only some kind of a nothing-but, none of its affirmations can make any claim to a general validity. But all nothing-but philoso-phies actually make such claims. Therefore they cannot be true; for if they were true, that would be the proof that they are false.","Unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of a mere individual; it strikes at Society itself.

You escape the state-appointed baby-tamers; but your society condemns you to pass your childhood in an exclusive family, with only a single set of siblings and parents. They\u2019re foisted on you by hereditary predestination. You can\u2019t get rid of them, can\u2019t take a holiday from them, can\u2019t go to anyone else for a change of moral or psychological air.

And, of course, stability isn\u2019t nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.","A crowd is chaotic, has no purpose of its own and is capable of anything except intelligent action and realistic thinking. Assembled in a crowd, people lose their powers of reasoning and their capacity for moral choice. They become very excitable, they lose all sense of individual or collective responsibility, they are subject to sudden accesses of rage, enthusiasm and panic.The crowd-intoxicated individual escapes from responsibility, intelligence and morality into a kind of frantic, animal mindlessness.Marching diverts men\'s thoughts.

The technical, verbal part of literature is simply a development of magic. Words are man\'s first and most grandiose invention. With language he created a whole new universe; what wonder if he loved words and attributed power to them! With fitted, harmonious words the magicians summoned rabbits out of empty hats and spirits from the elements. Their descendants, the literary men, still go on with the process, morticing their verbal formulas together, and, before the power of the finished spell, trembling with delight and awe. Rabbits out of empty hats? No, their spells are more subtly powerful, for they evoke emotions out of empty minds. Formulated by their art the most insipid statements become enormously significant.","You\'ve got to be good before you can do good - or at any rate do good without doing harm at the same time. Helping with one hand and hurting with the other - that\'s what the ordinary reformer does.","Uno cree las cosas porque ha sido condicionado para creerlas.... La gente cree en Dios porque ha sido condicionada para creer en Dios.","The dictatorships of tomorrow will deprive men of their freedom, but will give them in exchange a happiness none the less real, as a subjective experience, for being chemically induced. The pursuit of happiness is one of the traditional rights of man; unfortunately, the achievement of happiness may turn out to be incompatible with another of man\u2019s rights \u2014 namely, liberty.","Primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: they are gratuitous. A love of nature keeps no factories busy.","Organization is indispensable; for liberty arises and has meaning only within a self-regulating community of freely co-operating individuals. But, though indispensable, organization can also be fatal. Too much organization transforms men and women into automata, suffocates the creative spirit and abolishes the very possibility of freedom. As usual, the only safe course is in the middle, between the extremes of laissez-faire at one end of the scale and of total control at the other.","La civilizaci\xf3n no tiene necesidad de nobleza ni hero\xedsmo. Ambas cosas son sintomas de ineficacia pol\xedtica.","Another disproportionately fascinating symbol is the Singing Commercial. Singing Commercials are a recent invention; but the Singing Theological and the Singing Devotional -- the hymn and the psalm -- are as old as religion itself. Singing Militaries, or marching songs, are coeval with war, and Singing Patriotics, the precursors of our national anthems, were doubtless used to promote group solidarity, to emphasize the dis\xadtinction between \\"us\\" and \\"them,\\" by the wandering bands of paleolithic hunters and food gatherers. To most people music is intrinsically attractive. Moreover, melodies tend to ingrain themselves in the listener\'s mind. A tune will haunt the memory during the whole of a lifetime. Here, for example, is a quite uninterest\xading statement or value judgment. As it stands nobody will pay attention to it. But now set the words to a catchy and easily remembered tune. Immediately they become words of power. Moreover, the words will tend automatically to repeat themselves every time the mel\xadody is heard or spontaneously remembered. Orpheus has entered into an alliance with Pavlov -- the power of sound with the conditioned reflex. For the commercial propagandist, as for his colleagues in the fields of poli\xadtics and religion, music possesses yet another advan\xadtage. Nonsense which it would be shameful for a rea\xadsonable being to write, speak or hear spoken can be sung or listened to by that same rational being with pleasure and even with a kind of intellectual convic\xadtion. Can we learn to separate the pleasure of singing or of listening to song from the all too human tend\xadency to believe in the propaganda which the song is putting over? That again is the question.","What fun it would be if one didn\'t have to think about happiness!","Yo soy yo, y desear\xeda no serlo.

The arhat and the quietist may not practice contemplation in its fullness; but if they practice it at all, they may bring back enlightening reports of another, a transcendent country of the mind; and if they practice it in the height, they will become conduits through which some beneficent influence can flow out of that other country into a world of darkened selves, chronically dying for lack of it.\u201d","Uno puede tomarse unas vacaciones de la realidad siempre que se le antoje, y volver de las mismas sin siquiera un dolor de cabeza o una mitolog\xeda","Cien repeticiones tres noches por semana, durante cuatro a\xf1os -pens\xf3 Bernard Marx, que era especialista en hipnopedia-.

In practice great masses of human beings have again and again been sacrificed to applied science. The conflict between science, as it has been applied up to the present, and human interests was clearly stated by Thorstein Veblen in his Science in the Modern World. In this essay Veblen distinguishes between what he calls the pragmatic and the scientific point of view. Pragmatically human beings know pretty well what is good for them, and have developed myths and fairy tales, proverbs and popular philosophies, behaviour-patterns and moralities, in order to illustrate and embody their findings about life. The findings of science\u2014especially of science as applied for the benefit of the holders of centralized economic and political power\u2014are frequently in conflict with humanity\u2019s pragmatic values, and this conflict has been and still is the source of much unhappiness, frustration and bitterness.","To be shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception, to be shown for a few timeless hours the outer and the inner world, not as they appear to an animal obsessed with survival or to a human being obsessed with words and notions, but as they are apprehended, directly and unconditionally, by Mind at Large \u2013 thus an experience of inestimable value to everyone and especially to the intellectual. For the intellectual is by definition the man for whom, in Goethe\u2019s phrase, \u2018the word is essentially fruitful.\u2019 He is the man who feels that \u2018what we perceive by the eye is foreign to us as such and need not impress us deeply.\u2019 And yet, though himself an intellectual and one of the supreme masters of language, Goethe did not always agree with his own evaluation of the word. \u2018We talk,\u2019 he wrote in middle life, \u2018far too much. We should talk less and draw more. I personally should like to renounce speech altogether and, like organic Nature, communicate everything I have to say in sketches. That fig tree, this little snake, the cocoon on my window sill quietly awaiting its future \u2013 all these are momentous signatures. A person able to decipher their meaning properly would soon be able to dispense with the written or the spoken word altogether. The more I think of it, there is something futile, mediocre, even (I am tempted to say) foppish about speech. By contrast, how the gravity of Nature and her silence startle you, when you stand face to face with her, undistracted, before a barren ridge or in the desolation of the ancient hills.\u2019 We can never dispense with language and the other symbol systems; for it is by means of them, and only by their means, that we have raised ourselves above the brutes, to the level of human beings. But we can easily become the victims as well as the beneficiaries of these systems. We must learn how to handle words effectively; but at the same time we must preserve and, if necessary, intensify our ability to look at the world directly and not through that half-opaque medium of concepts, which distorts every given fact into the all too familiar likeness of some generic label or explanatory abstraction. Literary or scientific, liberal or specialist, all our education is predominantly verbal and therefore fails to accomplish what it is supposed to do. Instead of transforming children into fully developed adults, it turns out students of the natural sciences who are completely unaware of Nature as the primary fact of experience, it inflicts upon the world students of the Humanities who know nothing of humanity, their own or anyone else\u2019s.In a world where education is predominantly verbal, highly educated people find it all but impossible to pay serious attention to anything but words and notions. There is always money for, there are always doctrines in, the learned foolery of research into what, for scholars, is the all-important problem: Who influenced whom to say what when? Even in this age of technology the verbal humanities are honoured. The non-verbal humanities, the arts of being directly aware of the given facts of our existence, are almost completely ignored.Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic tradition into which he has been born - the beneficiary in as much as language gives access to the accumulated records of other people\'s experience, the victim in so far as it confirms him in the belief that reduced awareness is the only awareness and as it bedevils his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his concepts for data, his words for actual things. That which, in the language of religion, is called \\"this world\\" is the universe of reduced awareness, expressed, and, as it were, petrified by language.","Home, home-a few small rooms, stiflingly over-inhabited by a man, by a periodically teeming woman, by a rabble of boys and girls of all ages.

He could never, poor fellow, have seen a bunch of flowers shining with their own inner light and all but quivering under the pressure of the significance with which they were charged; could never have perceived that what rose and iris and carnation so intensely signified was nothing more, and nothing less, than what they were - a transience that was yet eternal life, a perpetual perishing that was at the same time pure Being, a bundle of minute, unique particulars in which, by some unspeakable and yet self-evident paradox, was to be seen the divine source of all existence.I continued to look at the flowers, and in their living light I seemed to detect the qualitative equivalent of breathing - but of a breathing without returns to a starting point, with no recurrent ebbs but only a repeated flow from beauty to heightened beauty, from deeper to ever deeper meaning. Words like \\"grace\\" and \\"transfiguration\\" came to my mind, and this, of course, was what, among other things, they stood for. My eyes traveled from the rose to the carnation, and from that feathery incandescence to the smooth scrolls of sentient amethyst which were the iris. The Beatific Vision, Sat Chit Ananda, Being-Awareness-Bliss-for the first time I understood, not on the verbal level, not by inchoate hints or at a distance, but precisely and completely what those prodigious syllables referred to.","From their earliest years, as soon, that is, as the examining psychologists have assigned them their place in the classified scheme, the Men of Faith will have had their special education under the eye of the Intelligences.

When there is a change in the being of the knower, there is a corresponding change in the nature and amount of knowing. For example, the being of a child is transformed by growth and education into that of a man; among the results of this transformation is a revolutionary change in the way of knowing and the amount and character of the things known. As the individual grows up, his knowledge becomes more conceptual and systematic in form, and its factual, utilitarian content is enormously increased. But these gains are offset by a certain deterioration in the quality of immediate apprehension, a blunting and a loss of intuitive power.","liberty, as we all know, cannot flourish in a country that is permanently on a war footing, or even a near-war footing.

That most popular and influential of all recent inventions, the radio, is nothing but a conduit through which pre-fabricated din can flow into our homes. And this din goes far deeper, of course, than the ear-drums. It penetrates the mind, filling it with a babel of distractions - news items, mutually irrelevant bits of information, blasts of corybantic or sentimental music, continually repeated doses of drama that bring no catharsis, but merely create a craving for daily or even hourly emotional enemas.","The legs, for example of that chair \u2013 how miraculous their tubularity, how supernatural their polished smoothness!

But excessive privilege and power are standing Temptations to pride, greed, vanity and cruelty; oppression results in fear and envy; warm breeze hatred, misery and despair. All such negative emotions are fatal to the spiritual life. Only the pure in heart and poor in spirit can come to the Knowledge of God.

D. Broad, \u2018that we should do well to consider much more seriously than we have hitherto been inclined to do the type of theory which Bergson put forward in connection with memory and sense perception. The suggestion is that the function of the brain and nervous system and sense organs is in the main eliminative and not productive. Each person is at each moment capable of remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe. The function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being overwhelmed and confused by this mass of largely useless and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive or remember at any moment, and leaving only that very small and special selection which is likely to be practically useful.\u2019 According","...este es el secreto de la felicidad y la virtud: amar lo que uno tiene que hacer.

They seemed to have imagined that it could be allowed to go on indefinitely, regardless of everything else. Knowledge was the highest good, truth the supreme value; all the rest was secondary and subordinate. True, ideas were beginning to change even then. Our Ford himself did a great deal to shift the emphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness. Mass production demanded the shift. Universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning; truth and beauty can\'t. And, of course, whenever the masses seized political power, then it was happiness rather than truth and beauty that mattered. Still, in spite of everything, unrestricted scientific research was still permitted. People still went on talking about truth and beauty as though they were the sovereign goods.

Thanks to his reasoning powers and to the instrument of reason, language, man (in his merely human condition) lives nostalgically, apprehensively and hopefully in the past and future as well as in the present; has no instincts to tell him what to do; must rely on personal cleverness, rather than on inspiration from the divine Nature of Things; finds himself in a condition of chronic civil war between passion and prudence and, on a higher level of awareness and ethical sensibility, between egotism and dawning spirituality. But this \\"wearisome condition of humanity\\" is the indispensable prerequisite of enlightenment and deliverance. Man must live in time in order to be able to advance into eternity, no longer on the animal, but on the spiritual level; he must be conscious of himself as a separate ego in order to be able consciously to transcend separate selfhood; he must do battle with the lower self in older that he may become identified with that higher Self within him, which is akin to the divine Not-Self; and finally he must make use of his cleverness in order to pass beyond cleverness to the intellectual vision of Truth, the immediate, unitive knowledge of the divine Ground. Reason and its works \\"are not and cannot be a proximate means of union with God.\\" The proximate means is \\"intellect,\\" in the scholastic sense of the word, or spirit. In the last analysis the use and purpose of reason is to create the internal and external conditions favourable to its own transfiguration by and into spirit. It is the lamp by which it finds the way to go beyond itself. We see, then, that as a means to a proximate means to an End, discursive reasoning is of enormous value. But if, in our pride and madness, we treat it as a proximate means to the divine End (as so many religious people have done and still do), or if, denying the existence of an eternal End, we regard it as at once the means to Progress and its ever-receding goal in time, cleverness becomes the enemy, a source of spiritual blindness, moral evil and social disaster. At no period in history has cleverness been so highly valued or, in certain directions, so widely and efficiently trained as at the present time. And at no time have intellectual vision and spirituality been less esteemed, or the End to which they are proximate means less widely and less earnestly sought for. Because technology advances, we fancy that we are making corresponding progress all along the line; because we have considerable power over inanimate nature, we are convinced that we are the self-sufficient masters of our fate and captains of our souls; and because cleverness has given us technology and power, we believe, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, that we have only to go on being yet cleverer in a yet more systematic way to achieve social order, international peace and personal happiness.","Conformity to the will of God, submission, docility to the leadings of the Holy Ghost in practice, if not verbally, these are the same as conformity to the Perfect Way, refusing to have preferences and cherish opinions, keeping the eyes open so that dreams may cease and Truth reveal itself.","Todas las personas que no se conforman con la ortodoxia, que tienen ideas propias.

The long orgy was at an end. If there had been no exorcists, it would never have begun.","He was thinking of death; death in the form of a new life growing and growing in his belly, like an embryo in a womb.

We know that the pursuit of good ends does not justify the employment of bad means. But what about those situations, now of such frequent occurrence, in which good means have end results which turn out to be bad? For example, we go to a tropical island and with the aid of DDT we stamp out malaria and, in two or three years, save hundreds of thousands of lives. This is obviously good. But the hundreds of thousands of hu\xadman beings thus saved, and the millions whom they beget and bring to birth, cannot be adequately clothed, housed, educated or even fed out of the island\'s availa\xadble resources. Quick death by malaria has been abol\xadished; but life made miserable by undernourishment and over-crowding is now the rule, and slow death by outright starvation threatens ever greater numbers.","El alma del saber puede convertirse en el mism\xedsimo cuerpo de la falsedad.

For their triumphs in the boudoir and the bed, such men as Marsillac and Nemours and the Chevalier de Grammont enjoyed a fame almost equal, while it lasted, to that of Gustavus Adolphus or Wallenstein. In the fashionable slang of the time, one \u2018embarked\u2019 on one of these glorious affairs, embarked deliberately and self-consciously for the express purpose of cutting a more considerable figure in the world. Sex can be used either for self-affirmation or for self-transcendence\u2014either to intensify the ego and consolidate the social persona by some kind of conspicuous \u2018embarkation\u2019 and heroic conquest, or else to annihilate the persona and transcend the ego in an obscure rapture of sensuality, a frenzy of romantic passion or, more creditably, in the mutual charity of the perfect marriage. With his peasant girls and his middle-class widows of little scruple and large appetite, the parson could get all the self-transcendence he wanted. Philippe Trincant now offered an occasion for the most agreeable and modish kind of self-affirmation\u2014with a hoped-for sequel, when the conquest had been consummated, of some peculiarly rare and precious kind of sensual self-transcendence.\u201d","The truth is, of course, that we are all organically related to God, to Nature and to our fellow-men. If every human being were constantly and consciously in a proper relationship with his divine, natural and social environments there would be only so much suffering as Creation makes inevitable.","The world\'s stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can\'t get. They\'re well off; they\'re safe; ignorant of passion and old age; they\'re plagued with no mothers or fathers; they\'ve got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they\'re so conditioned that they practically can\'t help behaving as they ought to behave.

In Brave New World, on the other hand, all are permitted to indulge their sex\xadual impulses without let or hindrance. The society de\xadscribed in Orwell\'s fable is a society permanently at war, and the aim of its rulers is first, of course, to exercise power for its own delightful sake and, second, to keep their subjects in that state of constant tension which a state of constant war demands of those who wage it. By crusading against sexuality the bosses are able to maintain the required tension in their followers and at the same time can satisfy their lust for power in a most gratifying way. The society described in Brave New World is a world-state, in which war has been eliminated and where the first aim of the rulers is at all costs to keep their subjects from making trouble. This they achieve by (among other methods) legaliz\xading a degree of sexual freedom (made possible by the abolition of the family) that practically guarantees the Brave New Worlders against any form of destruc\xadtive (or creative) emotional tension. In 1984 the lust for power is satisfied by inflicting pain; in Brave New World, by inflicting a hardly less humiliating pleasure.","From his point of view and at the level where he had chosen to do his dreadful work, Hitler was perfectly correct in his estimate of human nature. To those of us who look at men and women as individuals rather than as members of crowds, or of regimented collec\xadtives, he seems hideously wrong. In an age of accelerat\xading over-population, of accelerating over-organization and ever more efficient means of mass communication, how can we preserve the integrity and reassert the value of the human individual? This is a question that can still be asked and perhaps effectively answered. A generation from now it may be too late to find an answer and perhaps impossible, in the stifling collec\xadtive climate of that future time, even to ask the ques\xadtion.","Las palabras pueden ser como los rayos X, si se emplean adecuadamente: pasan a trav\xe9s de todo.

In theological language, this fear is due to the incompatibility between man\u2019s egotism and the divine purity, between man\u2019s self-aggravated separateness and the infinity of God.","What about self-denial, then?

But it\'s a matter of experience and observation that most idealism leads to war, persecution and mass insanity. Man cannot live by bread alone; but if he chooses to nourish his mind on the wrong kind of spiritual food, he won\'t even get bread. He won\'t even get bread, because he\'ll be so busy killing or preparing to kill his neighbours in the name of God, or Country, or Social Justice that he won\'t be able to cultivate his fields. Nothing could be more certain or obvious. But at the same time,\\" Mr. Propter continued, \\"nothing is more certain than that most people will go on choosing the wrong spiritual food and thereby indirectly choosing their own destruction.","Um Estado totalit\xe1rio verdadeiramente eficiente seria aquele em que os chefes pol\xedticos de um Poder Executivo todo-poderoso e seu ex\xe9rcito de administradores controlassem uma popula\xe7\xe3o de escravos que n\xe3o tivessem de ser coagidos porque amariam sua servid\xe3o.

The sun was shining and the shadows of the laths made a zebra-like pattern on the ground and across the seat and back of a garden chair, which was standing at this end of the pergola. That chair--shall I ever forget it? Where the shadows fell on the canvas upholstery, stripes of a deep but glowing indigo alternated with stripes of incandescence so intensely bright that it was hard to believe that they could be made of anything but blue fire. For what seemed an immensely long time I gazed without knowing, even without wishing to know, what it was that confronted me. At any other time I would have seen a chair barred with alternate light and shade. Today the precept swallowed up the concept. I was so completely absorbed in looking, so thunderstruck by what I actually saw, that I could not be aware of anything else. Garden furniture, laths, sunlight, shadow--these were no more than names and notions, mere verbalization, for utilitarian or scientific purposes, after the event. The even was this succession of azure furnace doors separated by gulfs of unfathomable gentian. It was wonderful, wonderful to the point, almost, of being terrifying.","In the same way, the reader of a book who happens to be out of tune with the author\'s prevailing mood will be bored to death by the things that were written with the greatest enthusiasm.

Well, why not reduce the equation to a simpler form by multiplying both sides by nought? In which case, you have m equals infinity times nought.

From lovelessness in relation to Nature we advance to lovelessness in relation to art - a lovelessness so extreme that we have effectively killed all the fundamental or useful arts and set up various kinds of mass-production by machines in their place. And of course this lovelessness in regard to art is at the same time a lovelessness in regard to the human beings who have to perform the fool-proof and grace-proof tasks imposed by our mechanical art-surrogates and by the interminable paper work connected with mass-production and mass-distribution.","In religion as in natural science, experience is determined only by experience.

It is of such that St. Francis de Sales is speaking when he says, \u201cGod did not deprive thee of the operation of his love, but thou didst deprive His love of thy cooperation. God would never have rejected thee, if thou hadst not rejected Him. To be clearly and constantly aware of the divine, guidance is given only to those who are already far advanced in the life of the spirit. In its earlier stages we have to work, not by the direct perception of God\u2019s successive graces, but by faith in their existence. We have to accept as a working hypothesis that the events of our lives are not merely fortuitous, but deliberate tests of intelligence and character, specially devised occasions (if properly used) for spiritual advance.\u201d","We cannot hope to utter anything worth saying, unless we read and inwardly digest the utterances of our betters.","What the rest of us see only under the influence of mescaline, the artist is congenitally equipped to see all the time.

It is in order that we may discover this fact for ourselves, by direct experience, that we exist. The final end and purpose of every human being is the unitive knowledge of God\u2019s being. What is the nature of God\u2019s being? The invocation to the Lord\u2019s Prayer gives us the answer. \u201cOur Father which art in heaven. God is, and is ours\u2014immanent in each sentient being, the life of all lives, the spirit animating every soul. But this is not all. God is also the transcendent Creator and Law-Giver, the Father who loves and, because He loves, also educates His children. And finally, God is \u201cin heaven.\u201d That is to say, He possesses a mode of existence which is incommensurable and incompatible with the mode of existence possessed by human beings in their natural, unspiritualized condition. Because He is ours and immanent, God is very close to us. But because He is also in heaven, most of us are very far from God. The saint is one who is as close to God as God is close to him. It is through prayer that men come to the unitive knowledge of God. But the life of prayer is also a life of mortification, of dying to self. It cannot be otherwise; for the more there is of self, the less there is of God. Our pride, our anxiety, our lusts for power and pleasure are God-eclipsing things. So too is that greedy attachment to certain creatures which passes too often for unselfishness and should be called, not altruism, but alter-egoism. And hardly less God-eclipsing is the seemingly self-sacrificing service which we give to any cause or ideal that falls short of the divine. Such service is always idolatry, and makes it impossible for us to worship God as we should, much less to know Him. God\u2019s kingdom cannot come unless we begin by making our human kingdoms go. Not only the mad and obviously evil kingdoms, but also the respectable ones\u2014the kingdoms of the scribes and pharisees, the good citizens and pillars of society, no less than the kingdoms of the publicans and sinners. God\u2019s being cannot be known by us, if we choose to pay our attention and our allegiance to something else, however creditable that something else may seem in the eyes of the world.\u201d","Those who detect no meaning in the world generally do so because, for one reason or another, it suits their books that the world should be meaningless.","La felicidad real siempre aparece escu\xe1lida en comparaci\xf3n con las compensaciones que ofrece la desdicha.","picked up the first volume that came to hand. It was on Van Gogh, and the picture at which the book opened was \u201cThe Chair\u2014that astounding portrait of a Ding an Sich, which the mad painter saw, with a kind of adoring terror, and tried to render on his canvas. But it was a task to which the power even of genius proved wholly inadequate. The chair Van Gogh had seen was obviously the same in essence as the chair I had seen.\u201d","Even the most ordinary experience of a thing or event in time can never be fully or adequately described in words. The experience of seeing the sky or having neuralgia is incommunicable; the best we can do is to say \'blue\' or \'pain,\' in the hope that those who hear us may have had experiences similar to our own and so be able to supply their own version of the meaning. God, however, is not a thing or event in time, and the time-bound words which cannot do justice even to temporal matters are even more inadequate to the intrinsic nature and our own unitive experience of that which belongs to an incommensurably different order. To suppose that people can be saved by studying and giving assent to formulae is like supposing that one can get to Timbuctoo by poring over a map of Africa. Maps are symbols, and even the best of them are inaccurate and imperfect symbols.

This immediate knowledge unites the knower with that which is known.Third: man possesses a double nature, a phenomenal ego and an eternal Self, which is the inner man, the spirit, the spark of divinity within the soul. It is possible for a man, if he so desires, to identify himself with the spirit and therefore with the Divine Ground, which is of the same or like nature with the spirit.Fourth: man\u2019s life on earth has only one end and purpose: to identify himself with his eternal Self and so to come to unitive knowledge of the Divine Ground.","He thought of Anne, of love hopeless and unattainable.

It is perfectly possible for a man to be out of prison, and yet not free -- to be under no physical constraint and yet to be a psychological captive, compelled to think, feel and act as the representatives of the national State, or of some private interest within the nation, want him to think, feel and act. There will never be such a thing as a writ of habeas mentem; for no sheriff or jailer can bring an illegally imprisoned mind into court, and no person whose mind had been made captive by the methods outlined in earlier articles would be in a position to complain of his captivity. The nature of psychological compulsion is such that those who act under constraint remain under the impression that they are acting on their own initiative. The vic\xadtim of mind-manipulation does not know that he is a victim. To him, the walls of his prison are invisible, and he believes himself to be free. That he is not free is apparent only to other people. His servitude is strictly objective.","Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly \u2013 they\u2019ll go through anything.","To discover the Kingdom of God exclusively within oneself is easier than to discover it, not only there, but also in the outer world of minds and things and living creatures. It is easier because the heights within reveal themselves to those who are ready to exclude from their purview all that lies without. And though this exclusion may be a painful and mortificatory process, the fact remains that it is less arduous than the process of inclusion, by which we come to know the fullness as well as the heights of spiritual life. Where there is exclusive concentration on the heights within, temptations and distractions are avoided and there is a general denial and suppression. But when the hope is to know God inclusively to realize the divine Ground in the world as well as in the soul, temptations and distractions must not be avoided, but submitted to and used as opportunities for advance; there must be no suppression of outward-turning activities, but a transformation of them so that they become sacramental.","It is the inactivity of self-will and ego-centred cleverness that makes possible the activity within the emptied and purified soul of the eternal Suchness. And when eternity is known in the heights within, it is also known in the fullness of experience, outside in the world.","As flores do campo e as paisagens, advertiu, t\xeam um grave-defeito: s\xe3o gratuitas.

Sometimes the entranced person feels impelled to speak about his or her experience. Deleuze, who was one of the best observers in the second generation of Animal Magnetists, records that this state of somnambulism is characterized by a complete detachment from all personal interests, by the absence of passion, by indifference to acquired opinions and prejudices and by \\"a novel manner of viewing objects , a quick and direct judgment, accompanied with an intimated conviction...Thus the somnambulist possesses at the same time the torch which gives him his light and the compass that points out his way. \\"This torch and this compass\\", Deleuze concludes, \\" are not the product of somnambulism; they are always in us, but the distracting cares of the world, the passions and, above all, pride, and attachment to perishable things prevent us from perceiving the one and consulting the other.\\" (Less dangerously and more effectively than the drugs which sometimes produce \\"anesthetic revelations\\" hypnotism temporarily abolishes distractions and allays the passions, leaving the consciousness free to occupy itself with what lies beyond the haunt of the immanent maniacs.) \\"In the new situation,\\" Deleuze continues, \\"the mind is filled with religious ideas, with which, perhaps, it was never before occupied\\".","In Hitler\u2019s words, the propagandist should adopt \u201ca systematically one-sided attitude towards every problem that has to be dealt with. He must never admit that he might be wrong or that people with a different point of view might be even partially right. Opponents should not be argued with; they should be attacked, shouted down, or, if they become too much of a nuisance, liquidated. The morally squeamish intellectual may be shocked by this kind of thing. But the masses are always convinced that \u201cright is on the side of the active aggressor.\u201d","Gestalt psychologists, such as Samuel Renshaw, have devised methods for widening the range and increasing the acuity of human perceptions. But do our educators apply them? The answer is, No.","Words are man\u2019s first and most grandiose invention. With language he created a whole new universe; what wonder if he loved words and attributed power to them!","Pavlov\'s findings were confirmed in the most dis\xadtressing manner, and on a very large scale, during the two World Wars. As the result of a single catastrophic experience, or of a succession of terrors less appalling but frequently repeated, soldiers develop a number of disabling psychophysical symptoms. Temporary unconsciousness, extreme agitation, lethargy, functional blindness or paralysis, completely unrealistic responses to the challenge of events, strange reversals of lifelong patterns of behavior -- all the symptoms, which Pavlov observed in his dogs, reappeared among the victims of what in the First World War was called \\"shell shock,\\" in the Second, \\"battle fatigue.\\" Every man, like every dog, has his own individual limit of endurance. Most men reach their limit after about thirty days of more or less continuous stress under the conditions of mod\xadern combat. The more than averagely susceptible suc\xadcumb in only fifteen days. The more than averagely tough can resist for forty-five or even fifty days. Strong or weak, in the long run all of them break down. All, that is to say, of those who are initially sane. For, ironically enough, the only people who can hold up indefinitely under the stress of modern war are psychotics. Individual insanity is immune to the consequences of collective insanity.","- J\xf3l gondold meg - \xf3vta Maryt h\xe1zass\xe1gk\xf6t\xe9s\xfck el\u0151tt -, szeg\xe9ny asszony leszel.

Neither is God inside, in the sense that the Protestants use the phrase - safely stowed away in the imagination, in the feelings and intellect, in the soul. He\'s there, of course, among other places. But he\'s also inside in the sense that a lump of bread\'s inside when you\'ve eaten it. He\'s in the very body, in the blood and bowels, in the heart and skin and loins. God\'s the total result, spiritual and physical, of any thought or action that makes for life, of any vital relation with the world. God\'s a quality of actions and relations - a felt, experienced quality. At any rate, he\'s that for our purposes, for purposes of living. Because, of course, for purposes of knowing and speculating he may be dozens of other things as well. He may be Rock of Ages; he may be the Jehovah of the Old Testament; he may be anything you like. But what\'s that got to do with us as living corporeal beings? Nothing, nothing but harm, at any rate. The moment you allow speculative truth to take the place of felt instinctive truth as a guide to living, you ruin everything.","To think of God as mere Power, and not also, at the same time as Power, Love and Wisdom, comes quite naturally to the ordinary, unregenerate human mind.

Deliberately hiding. It was a question of forcing him to come out of his lair, his abstract absolute lair, and compelling him to incarnate himself as a felt experienced quality of personal actions. It was a matter of violently dragging him from outsideness and aboveness to insideness. But God was a joker. Spandrell had conjured him with violence to appear; and out of the bloody steam of the magically compelling sacrifice had emerged only a dust-bin. But the very failure of the incantation had been a proof that God was there, outside. Nothing happens to a man except that which is like himself. Dust-bins to dust-bins, dung to dung. He had not succeeded in compelling God to pass from outsideness to insideness. But the appearance of the dust-bin confirmed the reality of God as a providence, God as a destiny, God as the giver or withholder of grace, God as the \u2018redestinating saviour or destroyer. Dust-bins had been his predestined lot. In giving him dust-bins yet again, the providential joker was merely being consistent.","It is a knowledge of the intrinsic significance of every existent.

Conditioned from earliest infancy (and perhaps also biologically predestined), the average middle- or lower-caste indi\xadvidual will never require conversion or even a re\xadfresher course in the true faith. The members of the highest caste will have to be able to think new thoughts in response to new situations; consequently their training will be much less rigid than the train\xading imposed upon those whose business is not to rea\xadson why, but merely to do and die with the minimum of fuss. These upper-caste individuals will be mem\xadbers, still, of a wild species -- the trainers and guard\xadians, themselves only slightly conditioned, of a breed of completely domesticated animals. Their wildness will make it possible for them to become heretical and rebellious. When this happens, they will have to be either liquidated, or brainwashed back into orthodoxy, or (as in Brave New World) exiled to some island, where they can give no further trouble, except of course to one another. But universal infant condition\xading and the other techniques of manipulation and con\xadtrol are still a few generations away in the future.

The literature of religious experience abounds in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming those who have come, too suddenly, face to face with some manifestation of the Mysterium tremendum. In theological language, this fear is due to the in- compatibility between man\'s egotism and the divine purity, between man\'s self-aggravated separateness and the infinity of God. Following Boehme and William Law, we may say that, by unregenerate souls, the divine Light at its full blaze can be apprehended only as a burning, purgatorial fire. An almost identical doctrine is to be found in The Tibetan Book of the Dead, where the departed soul is described as shrinking in agony from the Pure Light of the Void, and even from the lesser, tempered Lights, in order to rush headlong into the comforting darkness of selfhood as a reborn human being, or even as a beast, an unhappy ghost, a denizen of hell. Anything rather than the burning brightness of unmitigated Reality - anything!","Because it was not founded upon an eternity-philosophy, a doctrine of divinity dwelling in all living creatures, the modern movement in favour of kindness to animals was and is perfectly compatible with intolerance, persecution and systematic cruelty towards human beings.Young Nazis are taught to be gentle with dogs and cats, ruthless with Jews. That is because Nazism is a typical time-philosophy, which regards the ultimate good as existing, not in eternity, but in the future. Jews are, ex hypothesi, obstacles in the way of the realization of the supreme good; dogs and cats are not. The rest follows logically.","Uno cree las cosas porque ah sido condicionado para creerlas.","As the art and science of manipulation come to be better understood, the dictators of the future will doubtless learn to combine [techniques of propaganda] with the non-stop distractions which, in the West, are now threatening to drown in a sea of irrelevance the rational [information] essential to the maintenance of individual liberty.","\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0434\u043b\u044f \xab\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u0432\xbb \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0436\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043d, \u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u0447\u0438\u0432. \u041b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b; \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0442, \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442.","Our Ford himself did a great deal to shift the emphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness.

All that the conscious ego can do is to formulate wishes, which are then carried out by forces which it controls very little and understands not at all. When it does anything more -when it tries too hard, for example, when it worries, when it becomes apprehensive about the future -it lowers the effectiveness of those forces and may even cause the devitalized body to fall ill. In my present state, awareness was not referred to as ego; it was, so to speak, on its own. This meant that the physiological intelligence controlling the body was also on its own.
