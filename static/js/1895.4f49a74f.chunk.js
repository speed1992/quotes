I\u2019m not like an ordinary world. I have my madness, I live in another dimension and I do not have time for things that have no soul.","The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence.","People are strange: They are constantly angered by trivial things, but on a major matter like totally wasting their lives, they hardly seem to notice.","The difference between a democracy and a dictatorship is that in a democracy you vote first and take orders later; in a dictatorship you don\'t have to waste your time voting.","Wherever the crowd goes run in the other direction. They\'re always wrong.","Don\'t fight your demons. Your demons are here to teach you lessons. Sit down with your demons and have a drink and a chat and learn their names and talk about the burns on their fingers and scratches on their ankles. Some of them are very nice.","If something burns your soul with purpose and desire, it\u2019s your duty to be reduced to ashes by it. Any other form of existence will be yet another dull book in the library of life.","I see men assassinated around me every day. I walk through rooms of the dead, streets of the dead, cities of the dead; men without eyes, men without voices; men with manufactured feelings and standard reactions; men with newspaper brains, television souls and high school ideas.","The wisest thing to do if you\u2019re living in hell is to make yourself comfortable.","the free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it - basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.","Find what you love and let it kill you.","Beware of those who seek constant crowds; they are nothing alone.","The world is full of boring, identical and mindless people.","Sometimes I feel as if we are all trapped in a movie. We know our lines, where to walk, how to act, only there is no camera. Yet, we can\'t break out of the movie. And it\'s a bad one.","I will remember the kisses our lips raw with love and how you gave me everything you had and how I offered you what was left of me, and I will remember your small room the feel of you the light in the window your records your books our morning coffee our noons our nights our bodies spilled together sleeping the tiny flowing currents immediate and forever your leg my leg your arm my arm your smile and the warmth of you who made me laugh again.","In my next life I want to be a cat. To sleep 20 hours a day and wait to be fed. To sit around licking my ass.","You begin saving the world by saving one man at a time; all else is grandiose romanticism or politics.","Some people never go crazy, What truly horrible lives they must live.","Success is always dangerous. It can make an asshole out of anybody.","Some lose all mind and become soul,insane. some lose all soul and become mind, intellectual. some lose both and become accepted","Simplicity is always the secret, to a profound truth, to doing things, to writing, to painting. Life is profound in its simplicity","Some people like what you do, some people hate what you do, but most people simply don\'t give a damn.","I lapsed into my pathetic cut-off period. Often with humans, both good and bad, my senses simply shut off, they get tired, I give up. I am polite. I nod. I pretend to understand because I don\u2019t want anybody to be hurt. That is the one weakness that has lead me into the most trouble. Trying to be kind to others I often get my soul shredded into a kind of spiritual pasta. No matter. My brain shuts off. I listen. I respond. And they are too dumb to know that I am not there.","You have to die a few times before you can really live.","Do you hate people? I don\'t hate them...I just feel better when they\'re not around.","Beauty is nothing, beauty won\u2019t stay.

It\'s just a little while, and then it burns away... Love is a fog that burns with the first daylight of reality.","The problem was you had to keep choosing between one evil or another, and no matter what you chose, they sliced a little more off you, until there was nothing left. At the age of 25 most people were finished. A whole goddamned nation of assholes driving automobiles, eating, having babies, doing everything in the worst way possible, like voting for the presidential candidate who reminded them most of themselves.","If you\'re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don\'t even start.","Almost everybody is born a genius and buried an idiot.","I guess the only time most people think about injustice is when it happens to them.","I stopped looking for a Dream Girl, I just wanted one that wasn\'t a nightmare.","We\'re all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn\'t. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.","nobody can save you but yourself and you\u2019re worth saving. it\u2019s a war not easily won but if anything is worth winning then this is it.","I am a series of small victories and large defeats and I am as amazed as any other that I have gotten from there to here.","Slavery was never abolished, it was only extended to include all the colors.","It\'s not the large things that send a man to the madhouse... no, it\'s the continuing series of small tragedies... not the death of his love but the shoelace that snaps with no time left.","We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.","An artist is a man who says a difficult thing in a simple way","what matters most is how well you walk through the fire","Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, I\'m not going to make it, but you laugh inside \u2014 remembering all the times you\'ve felt that way.","You know the typical crowd, Wow, it\u2019s Friday night, what are you going to do? Just sit there? Well, yeah. Because there\u2019s nothing out there. It\u2019s stupidity. Stupid people mingling with stupid people. Let them stupidify themselves. I\u2019ve never been bothered with the need to rush out into the night. That\u2019s all. Sorry for all the millions, but I\u2019ve never been lonely. I like myself. I\u2019m the best form of entertainment I have.","Sundays kill more people than bombs.","I am not like \\n other people. \\n I am \\n burning in hell. The hell of \\n myself.","That\'s the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.","This is very important -- to take leisure time. Pace is the essence. Without stopping entirely and doing nothing at all for great periods, you\'re gonna lose everything...just to do nothing at all, very, very important. And how many people do this in modern society? Very few. That\'s why they\'re all totally mad, frustrated, angry and hateful.","I was laying in bed one night and I thought \'I\'ll just quit - to hell with it.\' And another little voice inside me said \'Don\'t quit - save that tiny little ember of spark.\' And never give them that spark because as long as you have that spark, you can start the greatest fire again.","I am not a snob; it is simply that I am not interested with what most people have to say, or what they want to do \u2014 mostly with my time.","If you\'re losing your soul and you know it, then you\'ve still got a soul left to lose.","We don\u2019t even ask happiness, just a little less pain.","There are only two things wrong with money: too much or too little.","Animals never worry about Heaven or Hell. Neither do I.

I loved to mix the two together.","Only the boring get bored","The masses are always wrong...Wisdom is doing everything the crowd does not do. All you do is reverse the totality of their learning and you have the heaven they\'re looking for.","I\'ve never been lonely. I\'ve been in a room... I\'ve felt suicidal, I\'ve been depressed. I\'ve felt awful ... awful beyond all , but I never felt that one other person could enter that room and cure what was bothering me...or that any number of people could enter that room. In other words, loneliness is something I\'ve never been bothered with because I\'ve always had this terrible itch for solitude.","My dear, Find what you love and let it kill you. Let it drain you of your all. Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness. Let it kill you and let it devour your remains. For all things will kill you, both slowly and fastly, but it\u2019s much better to be killed by a lover. ~ Falsely yours","It\'s possible to love a human being if you don\'t know them too well.","Drinking is an emotional thing. It joggles you out of the standardism of everyday life, out of everything being the same. It yanks you out of your body and your mind and throws you against the wall. I have the feeling that drinking is a form of suicide where you\'re allowed to return to life and begin all over the next day. It\'s like killing yourself, and then you\'re reborn. I guess I\'ve lived about ten or fifteen thousand lives now.","The less I needed, the better I felt.","Love is a form of prejudice. You love what you need, you love what makes you feel good, you love what is convenient. How can you say you love one person when there are ten thousand people in the world that you would love more if you ever met them? But you\'ll never meet them.","My ambition is handicapped by laziness","the tired sunsets and the tired people - it takes a lifetime to die and no time at all.","Are people crazy? People waited all their lives. They waited to live, they waited to die. They waited in line to buy toilet paper. They waited in line for money. And if they didn\'t have any money they waited in longer lines. You waited to go to sleep and then you waited to awaken. You waited to get married and you waited to get divorced. You waited for it to rain, you waited for it to stop. You waited to eat and then you waited to eat again. You waited in a shrink\'s office with a bunch of psychos and you wondered if you were one.","For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can\'t readily accept the God formula, the big answers don\'t remain stonewritten. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.","\u200e\\"she\u2019 mad but she\u2019 magic. there\u2019 no lie in her fire.","Are you becoming what you\'ve always hated?","Drink from the well of yourself and begin again.","The more cats you have, the longer you live. If you have a hundred cats, you\'ll live ten times longer than if you have ten. Someday this will be discovered, and people will have a thousand cats and live forever.","If you\'re going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It\'s the only good fight there is.","Those faces you see every day on the streets were not created entirely without hope: be kind to them: like you they have not escaped.","The nine-to-five is one of the greatest atrocities sprung upon mankind. You give your life to a function that doesn\'t interest you. This situation so repelled me that I was driven to drink, starvation, and mad females, simply as an alternative.","People empty me. I have to get away to refill.","Sex is interesting, but it\'s not totally important. I mean it\'s not even as important (physically) as excretion. A man can go seventy years without a piece of ass, but he can die in a week without a bowel movement.","I am for the small man who has not forgotten, for the man who loves his beer and his women and his sunlight","In a capitalistic society the losers slaved for the winners and you have to have more losers than winners.","If you let them kill you, they will","I think that everything should be made available to everybody, and I mean LSD, cocaine, codeine, grass, opium, the works. Nothing on earth available to any man should be confiscated and made unlawful by other men in more seemingly powerful and advantageous positions.","I was drawn to all the wrong things: I liked to drink, I was lazy, I didn\'t have a god, politics, ideas, ideals. I was settled into nothingness; a kind of non-being, and I accepted it. I didn\'t make for an interesting person. I didn\'t want to be interesting, it was too hard. What I really wanted was only a soft, hazy space to live in, and to be left alone.","I lie as truthfully as I can.","The crazy ones only laugh when there is no reason to laugh.","I like women who haven\u2019t lived with too many men. I don\u2019t expect virginity but I simply prefer women who haven\u2019t been rubbed raw by experience. There is a quality about women who choose men sparingly; it appears in their walk in their eyes in their laughter and in their gentle hearts. Women who have had too many men seem to choose the next one out of revenge rather than with feeling. When you play the field selfishly everything works against you: one can\u2019t insist on love or demand affection. You\u2019re finally left with whatever you have been willing to give which often is: nothing.","I don\'t remember going to bed, but in the morning, there I was.","Death is nothing, brother, it\'s life that\'s hard","Any asshole can chase a skirt, art takes discipline.","Capitalism has survived communism. Now, it eats away at itself.","The difference between a brave man and a coward is a coward thinks twice before jumping in the cage with a lion. The brave man doesn\'t know what a lion is. He just thinks he does.","Death meant little to me. It was the last joke in a series of bad jokes.","You can steal my women but don\'t play with my whiskey.","Pain is strange. A cat killing a bird, a car accident, a fire.... Pain arrives, BANG, and there it is, it sits on you. It\'s real. And to anybody watching, you look foolish. Like you\'ve suddenly become an idiot. There\'s no cure for it unless you know somebody who understands how you feel, and knows how to help.","I just want a hot cup of coffee,black,and I don\u2019t want to hear about your troubles.","With me, my main vision for life was to avoid as many people as possible. The less people I saw the better I felt.","I\'ve never met another man I\'d rather be.","If I never see you again I will always carry you inside outside on my fingertips and at brain edges and in centers centers of what I am of what remains.","I mean, say that you figure that everything is senseless, then it can\'t be quite senseless because you are aware that it\'s senseless and your awareness of senselessness almost gives it sense. You know what I mean?","People with no morals often considered themselves more free, but mostly they lacked the ability to feel or love.","as the spirit wanes the form appears","I walked around the block twice, passed 200 people and failed to see a human being.","If you have the ability to love, love yourself first.","Lighting new cigarettes, pouring more drinks. It has been a beautiful fight. Still is.","Censorship is the tool of those who have the need to hide actualities from themselves and from others. Their fear is only their inability to face what is real, and I can\'t vent any anger against them. I only feel this appalling sadness. Somewhere, in their upbringing, they were shielded against the total facts of our existence. They were only taught to look one way when many ways exist.","and when love came to us twice and lied to us twice we decided to never love again that was fair fair to us and fair to love itself. we ask for no mercy or no miracles; we are strong enough to live and to die and to kill flies, attend the boxing matches, go to the racetrack, live on luck and skill, get alone, get alone often, and if you can\'t sleep alone be careful of the words you speak in your sleep; and ask for no mercy no miracles; and don\'t forget: time is meant to be wasted, love fails and death is useless.","Style is the answer to everything. A fresh way to approach a dull or dangerous thing. To do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a dangerous thing without it. To do a dangerous thing with style is what I call art.","Knowledge without follow-through is worse than no knowledge.","To create art means to be crazy alone forever.","We\u2019ve died so many times now that we can only wonder why we still care.","I went to the worst of bars hoping to get killed but all I could do was to get drunk again.","Invent yourself and then reinvent yourself.","Intellectuals say simple things in difficult ways. Artists say difficult things in simple ways.","if it doesn\'t come bursting out of you in spite of everything, don\'t do it. unless it comes unasked out of your heart and your mind and your mouth and your gut, don\'t do it.","I felt like crying but nothing came out. it was just a sort of sad sickness, sick sad, when you can\'t feel any worse. I think you know it. I think everybody knows it now and then. but I think I have known it pretty often, too often.","There\'s nothing to stop a man from writing unless that man stops himself. If a man truly desires to write, then he will. Rejection and ridicule will only strengthen him. And the longer he is held back the stronger he will become, like a mass of rising water against a dam. There is no losing in writing, it will make your toes laugh as you sleep, it will make you stride like a tiger, it will fire the eye and put you face to face with death. You will die a fighter, you will be honored in hell. The luck of the word. Go with it, send it.","Things get bad for all of us, almost continually, and what we do under the constant stress reveals who/what we are.","The shortest distance between two points is often unbearable.","Insanity is relative. Who sets the norm?","Writing is something that you don\'t know how to do. You sit down and it\'s something that happens, or it may not happen. So, how can you teach anybody how to write? It\'s beyond me, because you yourself don\'t even know if you\'re going to be able to. I\'m always worried, well, you know, every time I go upstairs with my wine bottle. Sometimes I\'ll sit at that typewriter for fifteen minutes, you know. I don\'t go up there to write. The typewriter\'s up there. If it doesn\'t start moving, I say, well this could be the night that I hit the dust.","I couldn\'t get myself to read the want ads. The thought of sitting in front of a man behind a desk and telling him that I wanted a job, that I was qualified for a job, was too much for me. Frankly, I was horrified by life, at what a man had to do simply in order to eat, sleep, and keep himself clothed. So I stayed in bed and drank. When you drank the world was still out there, but for the moment it didn\'t have you by the throat.","I no longer want it all, just some comfort and some sex and some minor love.","nobody can save you but yourself. you will be put again and again into nearly impossible situations. they will attempt again and again through subterfuge, guise and force to make you submit, quit and/or die quietly inside. nobody can save you but yourself","Goodness can be found sometimes in the middle of hell.","Without literature, life is hell.","Drinking is another way of thinking, another way of living. It gives you two lives instead of one.","I still have a little whiskey left and therefore a chance.","Sometimes you just have to pee in the sink.","I have gotten so used to melancholia that I greet it like an old friend.","you boys can keep your virgins give me hot old women in high heels with asses that forgot to get old.","Beware Those Who Are ALWAYS READING BOOKS","I want so much that is not here and do not know where to go.","You\'ve got to know when to let a woman go if you want to keep her,and if you don\'t want to keep her you let her go anyhow so it\'s always a process of letting go, one way or the other.","I never write in the daytime. It\'s like running through the shopping mall with your clothes off. Everybody can see you. At night ... that\'s when you pull the tricks ... magic.","I had no interests. I had no interest in anything. I had no idea how I was going to escape. At least the others had some taste for life. They seemed to understand something that I didn\u2019t understand. Maybe I was lacking. It was possible. I often felt inferior. I just wanted to get away from them. But there was no place to go. Suicide? Jesus Christ, just more work. I felt like sleeping for five years but they wouldn\u2019t let me.","The male, for all his bravado and exploration, is the loyal one, the one who generally feels love. The female is skilled at betrayal and torture and damnation.","Human relationships are strange. I mean, you are with one person a while, eating and sleeping and living with them, loving them, talking to them, going places together, and then it stops.","I remember awakening one morning and finding everything smeared with the color of forgotten love.","Let it die. Let there be a new beginning. It\u2019s awful. Goodnight.","I didn\'t like parties.I didn\'t know how to dance and people frightened me, especially people at parties. They attempted to be sexy and gay and witty and although they hoped they were good at it, they weren \'t. They were bad at it. Their trying so hard only made it worse.","Pretty words, as pretty women, wrinkle up and die.","If I bet on humanity, I\'d never cash a ticket.","If you want to know where God is, ask a drunk.","I don\u2019t understand people, never will. It looks like I got to travel pretty much alone.","I have no time for things that have no soul.","Real loneliness is not necessarily limited to when you are alone.","I can almost understand why people leap from bridges.","We are like roses that have never bothered to bloom when we should have bloomed and it is as if the sun has become disgusted with waiting","An early taste of death is not necessarily a bad thing.","The streets were full of insane & dull people. Most of them lived in nice houses and didn\'t seem to work, and you wondered how they did it.","The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it","Things will be far worse than they are now. And far better. I wait.","I wasn\u2019t lonely. I experienced no self-pity. I was just caught up in a life in which I could \ufb01nd no meaning.","It\'s better to do a dull thing with style than a dangerous thing without it.","There may not be a hell, but those who judge may create one. I think people are over-taught. They are over-taught everything. You have to find out by what happens to you, how you will react. I\'ll have to use a strange term here... \\"good.\\" I don\'t know where it comes from, but I feel that there\'s an ultimate strain of goodness born in each of us. I don\'t believe in God, but I believe in this \\"goodness\\" like a tube running through our bodies. It can be nurtured. It\'s always magic, when on a freeway packed with traffic, a stranger makes room for you to change lanes... it gives you hope.","Human relationships didn\'t work anyhow. Only the first two weeks had any zing, then the participants lost their interest. Masks dropped away and real people began to appear: cranks, imbeciles, the demented, the vengeful, sadists, killers. Modern society had created its own kind and they feasted on each other. It was a duel to the death--in a cesspool.","There are times when those eyes inside your brain stare back at you.","there is always one woman to save you from another and as that woman saves you she makes ready to destroy","People were interesting at first. Then later, slowly but surely, all the flaws and madness would manifest themselves. I would become less and less to them; they would mean less and less to me.","Genius might be the ability to say a profound thing in a simple way.","there is a place in the heart that will never be filled a space and even during the best moments and the greatest times times we will know it we will know it more than ever there is a place in the heart that will never be filled and we will wait and wait in that space.","Writing is like going to bed with a beautiful woman and afterwards she gets up, goes to her purse and gives me a handful of money.","your letters got sadder. your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all lovers betray. it didn\'t help. you said you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and the bridge was over the river and you sat on the crying bench every night and wept for the lovers who had hurt and forgotten you.","when I was a boy I used to dream of becoming the village idiot. I used to lie in bed and imagine myself the happy idiot able to get food easily ...and easy sympathy, a planned confusion of not too much love or effort. some would claim that I have succeeded.","But my whole life has been a matter of fighting for one simple hour to do what I want to do. There was always something getting in the way of my getting to myself.","Never envy a man his lady. Behind it all lays a living hell.","Before my death I hope to obtain my life.","True revolution comes from true revulsion; when things get bad enough the kitten will kill the lion.","Thanksgiving. It proved you had survived another year with its wars, inflation, unemployment, smog, presidents. It was a grand neurotic gathering of clans: loud drunks, grandmothers, sisters, aunts, screaming children, would-be suicides. And don\'t forget indigestion. I wasn\'t different from anyone else: There sat the 18-pound bird on my sink, dead, plucked, totally disemboweled. Iris would roast it for me.","great writers are indecent people they live unfairly saving the best part for paper. good human beings save the world so that bastards like me can keep creating art, become immortal. if you read this after I am dead it means I made it.","Dog is much admired by Man because he believes in the hand which feeds him. A perfect set-up. For 13 cents a day you\'ve got a hired killer who thinks you are god. A dog can\'t tell a Nazi from a Republican from a Commie from a Democrat and, many times, neither can I.","I had no feeling for the things so many others needed.","There still might be a place for us somewhere.","I loved you like a man loves a woman he never touches, only writes to, keeps little photographs of.","When you play the field selfishly everything works against you: one can\u2019t insist on love or demand affection. you\u2019re finally left with whatever you have been willing to give which often is: nothing.","They never pay the slaves enough so they can get free, just enough so they can stay alive and come back to work.","It was like the beginning of life and laughter. It was the real meaning of the sun","being alone never felt right. sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right.","The Difference Between Art and Life is that Art is More Bearable","Bad poetry is caused by people who sit down and think, Now I am going to write a Poem.","there is a loneliness in this world so great that you can see it in the slow movement of the hands of a clock","I am a poem. There is no way out.","I enjoy the bad things that are said about me. It enhances sales and makes me feel evil. I don\'t like to feel good \'cause I am good. But evil? Yes. It gives me another dimension.","He asked, \\"What makes a man a writer?\\" \\"Well,\\" I said, \\"it\'s simple. You either get it down on paper, or jump off a bridge.","I will remember the kisses, our lips raw with love, and how you gave me everything you had and how I offered you what was left of me.","I am not a man who looks for solutions in God or politics. If somebody else wants to do the dirty work and create a better world for us and he can do it, I will accept it.","\\"Baby,\\" I said. \\"I\'m a genius but nobody knows it but me.\\"","There will always be something to ruin our lives, it all depends on what or which finds us first.

The earth swarmed with them.","When a hot woman meets a hermit one of them is going to change.","I was beaten down long ago in some alley in another world.","Gradually I came to realize that my understanding of women goes only as far as the pleasure is concerned.","Each person is only given so many evenings and each wasted evening is a gross violation against the natural course of your only life.","and love is a word used too much and much too soon.","Love is a fog that burns with the first daylight of reality.","stay with the beer. beer is continuous blood. a continuous lover.","It\u2019s so easy to be easy\u2014if you let it.","Don\'t wait for the good woman.

What I objected to was to be denied the right to sit in a small room and starve and drink cheap wine and go crazy in my own way and at my own leisure.","Life\'s as kind as you let it be.","the tigers have found me and I do not care.","Some men hope for revolution but when you revolt and set up your new government you find your new government is still the same old Papa, he has only put on a cardboard mask.","I wish to weep but sorrow is stupid. I wish to believe but belief is a graveyard.","It\u2019s when you hide things that you choke on them.","Most of the world was mad. And the part that wasn\'t mad was angry.

Little blades. She was helpless.","There is nothing that teaches you more than regrouping after failure and moving on. Yet most people are stricken with fear.

The only time they like them is when they are dead or if they have been for a long time. Writers only like to sniff their own turds. I am one of those. I don\'t even like to talk to writers, look at them or worse, listen to them. And the worst is to drink with them, they slobber all over themselves, really look piteous, look like they are searching for the wing of the mother.

In the end it hardly mattered; no matter what they did, we ended up lonely and insane.","If you want to know who your friends are, get yourself a jail sentence.","Why did I come here? I thought. Why is it always only a matter of choosing between something bad and something worse?","I made practice runs down to skid row to get ready for my future.","I didn\'t have any friends at school, didn\'t want any.

I\'ve been depressed. I\'ve felt awful -- awful beyond all -- but I never felt that one other person could enter that room and cure what was bothering me...or that any number of people could enter that room. In other words, loneliness is something I\'ve never been bothered with because I\'ve always had this terrible itch for solitude. It\'s being at a party, or at a stadium full of people cheering for something, that I might feel loneliness. I\'ll quote Ibsen, \\"The strongest men are the most alone.\\" I\'ve never thought, \\"Well, some beautiful blonde will come in here and give me a fuck-job, rub my balls, and I\'ll feel good.\\" No, that won\'t help.

All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you\'ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you\'re going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter.

People just blindly grabbed at whatever there was: communism, health foods, zen, surfing, ballet, hypnotism, group encounters, orgies, biking, herbs, Catholicism, weight-lifting, travel, withdrawal, vegetarianism, India, painting, writing, sculpting, composing, conducting, backpacking, yoga, copulating, gambling, drinking, hanging around, frozen yogurt, Beethoven, Back, Buddha, Christ, TM, H, carrot juice, suicide, handmade suits, jet travel, New York City, and then it all evaporated and fell apart.

They concentrate too much on fucking, movies, money, family, fucking. Their minds are full of cotton. They swallow God without thinking, they swallow country without thinking. Soon they forget how to think, they let others think for them. Their brains are stuffed with cotton. They look ugly, they talk ugly, they walk ugly.

Granted. But we must still realize that love is just the result of a chance encounter. Most people make too much of it. On these grounds a good fuck is not to be entirely scorned.

I don\u2019t think it hurts, sometimes, to remember where you came from. You know the places where I came from. Even the people who try to write about that or make films about it, they don\u2019t get it right. They call it \u201c9 to 5. It\u2019s never 9 to 5, there\u2019s no free lunch break at those places, in fact, at many of them in order to keep your job you don\u2019t take lunch. Then there\u2019s OVERTIME and the books never seem to get the overtime right and if you complain about that, there\u2019s another sucker to take your place. You know my old saying, \u201cSlavery was never abolished, it was only extended to include all the colors.\u201d And what hurts is the steadily diminishing humanity of those fighting to hold jobs they don\u2019t want but fear the alternative worse. People simply empty out. They are bodies with fearful and obedient minds. The color leaves the eye. The voice becomes ugly. And the body. The hair. The fingernails. The shoes. Everything does. As a young man I could not believe that people could give their lives over to those conditions. As an old man, I still can\u2019t believe it. What do they do it for? Sex? TV? An automobile on monthly payments? Or children? Children who are just going to do the same things that they did? Early on, when I was quite young and going from job to job I was foolish enough to sometimes speak to my fellow workers: \u201cHey, the boss can come in here at any moment and lay all of us off, just like that, don\u2019t you realize that?\u201d They would just look at me. I was posing something that they didn\u2019t want to enter their minds. Now in industry, there are vast layoffs (steel mills dead, technical changes in other factors of the work place). They are layed off by the hundreds of thousands and their faces are stunned: \u201cI put in 35 years\u2026\u201d \u201cIt ain\u2019t right\u2026\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\u201d They never pay the slaves enough so they can get free, just enough so they can stay alive and come back to work. I could see all this. Why couldn\u2019t they? I figured the park bench was just as good or being a barfly was just as good. Why not get there first before they put me there? Why wait? I just wrote in disgust against it all, it was a relief to get the shit out of my system. And now that I\u2019m here, a so-called professional writer, after giving the first 50 years away, I\u2019ve found out that there are other disgusts beyond the system. I remember once, working as a packer in this lighting fixture company, one of the packers suddenly said: \u201cI\u2019ll never be free!\u201d One of the bosses was walking by (his name was Morrie) and he let out this delicious cackle of a laugh, enjoying the fact that this fellow was trapped for life. So, the luck I finally had in getting out of those places, no matter how long it took, has given me a kind of joy, the jolly joy of the miracle. I now write from an old mind and an old body, long beyond the time when most men would ever think of continuing such a thing, but since I started so late I owe it to myself to continue, and when the words begin to falter and I must be helped up stairways and I can no longer tell a bluebird from a paperclip, I still feel that something in me is going to remember (no matter how far I\u2019m gone) how I\u2019ve come through the murder and the mess and the moil, to at least a generous way to die. To not to have entirely wasted one\u2019s life seems to be a worthy accomplishment, if only for myself. Your boy, Hank\u201d","and I said, I was beaten down long ago in some alley in another world.","SparkI always resented all the years, the hours, theminutes I gave them as a working stiff, itactually hurt my head, my insides, it made medizzy and a bit crazy \u2014 I couldn\u2019t understand themurdering of my yearsyet my fellow workers gave no signs ofagony, many of them even seemed satisfied, andseeing them that way drove me almost as crazy asthe dull and senseless work.the workers submitted.the work pounded them to nothingness, they werescooped-out and thrown away.I resented each minute, every minute as it wasmutilatedand nothing relieved the monotonous ever-structure.I considered suicide.I drank away my few leisure hours.I worked for decades.I lived with the worst of women, they killed whatthe job failed to kill.I knew that I was dying.something in me said, go ahead, die, sleep, becomethem, accept.then something else in me said, no, save the tiniestbit.it needn\u2019t be much, just a spark.a spark can set a whole forest onfire.just a spark.save it.I think I did.I\u2019m glad I did.what a lucky god damnedthing.","she died of alcoholism wrapped in a blanket on a deck chair on an ocean steamer.  all her books of terrified loneliness  all her books about the cruelty of loveless love  were all that was left of her  as the strolling vacationer discovered her body  notified the captain and she was quickly dispatched to somewhere else on the ship  as everything continued just as she had written it.","we are worn-down, hope stamped out.

Have a definite program, clearly worded, so if DO win you will have a suitable and decent form of government.","\u0417\u0435\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0430. \u0421\u043c\u043e\u0433, \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430, \u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0432\u044a\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445, \u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430, \u043e\u043c\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0430, \u043e\u0442\u0447\u0430\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e, \u0432\u0441\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e. \u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0449\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0432\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e \u0449\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0447\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0441 \u0438\u0437\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u044a\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435. \u0422\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0435 \u0442\u044a\u0436\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u0438\u0449\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u0447\u0435 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e.","get me in a room with more than 3 people I tend to act ill odd.","It was a lucky night.","\u0427\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0430\u0431\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0438\u0449\u043e, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0438\u0448\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u043d\u0435\u0449\u0430\u0442\u0430, \u043e\u0431\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u044f \u0433\u0438. \u041d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440, \u0430\u043a\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0448, \u0447\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0430\u0448 \u0432\u0441\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0442\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0435 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u043c\u0438\u0441\u044a\u043b, \u0437\u0430\u0449\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0448, \u0447\u0435 \u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u043c\u0438\u0441\u044a\u043b \u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435 \u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d \u0441\u043c\u0438\u0441\u044a\u043b. \u041d\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435? \u041e\u043f\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0435\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0437\u044a\u043c.","She says Thomas drank himself to death because he felt his talent was waning.

When I was a young man I felt these things were dumb, unsophisticated. I had bad blood, a twisted mind, a precarious upbringing. I was hard as granite, I leered at the sun. I trusted no man and especially no woman... I challenged everything, was continually being evicted, jailed, in and out of fights, in and out of my mind... Peace and happiness to me were signs of inferiority, tenants of the weak, an addled mind. But as I went on...it gradually began to occur to me that I wasn\'t different from the others, I was the same... Everybody was nudging, inching, cheating for some insignificant advantage, the lie was the weapon and the plot was empty... Cautiously, I allowed myself to feel good at times. I found moments of peace in cheap rooms just staring at the knobs of some dresser or listening to the rain in the dark. The less I needed the better I felt... I re-formulated. I don\'t know when, date, time, all that but the change occured. Something in me relaxed, smoothed out. I no longer had to prove that I was a man, I didn\u2019t have to prove anything. I began to see things: coffee cups lined up behind a counter in a cafe. Or a dog walking along a sidewalk. Or the way the mouse on my dresser top stopped there with its body, its ears, its nose, it was fixed, a bit of life caught within itself and its eyes looked at me and they were beautiful. Then...it was gone. I began to feel good, I began to feel good in the worst situations and there were plenty of those... I welcomed shots of peace, tattered shards of happiness... And finally I discovered real feelings of others, unheralded, like lately, like this morning, as I was leaving for the track, I saw my wife in bed, just the shape of her head there...so still, I ached for her life, just being there under the covers. I kissed her in the forehead, got down the stairway, got outside, got into my marvelous car, fixed the seatbelt, backed out the drive. Feeling warm to the fingertips, down to my foot on the gas pedal, I entered the world once more, drove down the hill past the houses full and empty of people, I saw the mailman, honked, he waved back at me.","Having a bunch of cats around is good.
