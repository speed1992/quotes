They are what they are.","It\'s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.","Happiness and freedom begin with a clear understanding of one principle: Some things are within our control, and some things are not. It is only after you have faced up to this fundamental rule and learned to distinguish between what you can and can\'t control that inner tranquility and outer effectiveness become possible.","It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.","Be careful whom you associate with. It is human to imitate the habits of those with whom we interact.

There must be time.

Your nobler self cannot wait any longer.","Progress is not achieved by luck or accident, but by working on yourself daily.","No matter what happens, it is within my power to turn it to my advantage.","These are the signs of a wise man: to reprove nobody, to praise nobody, to blame nobody, nor even to speak of himself or his own merits.","Wisdom means understanding without any doubt that circumstances do not rise to meet our expectations. Events happen as they may. People behave as they will.","An ignorant person is inclined to blame others for his own misfortune. To blame oneself is proof of progress.

Think more often of God than you breathe.","The people have a right to the truth as they have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.","Don\'t explain your philosophy.

Then you will forget your anger.","In trying to please other people, we find ourselves misdirected toward what lies outside our sphere of influence.

Nothing truly holds you back.  For your own will is always within your control.  Sickness may challenge your body. But are you merely your body? Lameness may impede your legs. But you are not merely your legs. Your will is bigger than your legs.

If you wish to be an extraordinary person, if you wish to become wise, then you should explicitly identify the kind of person you aspire to become.

Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person. Books are the training weights of the mind.

If you wish to be an extraordinary person, if you wish to be wise, then you should explicitly identify the kind of person you aspire to become.","It is not he who reviles or strikes you who insults you, but your opinion that these things are insulting.","Some things are in our control and others not.

Make the most of what you\'ve got.","It was the first and most striking characteristic of Socrates never to become heated in discourse, never to utter an injurious or insulting word -- on the contrary, he persistently bore insult from others and thus put an end to the fray.","What concerns me is not the way things are, but rather the way people think things are.","Attach yourself to what is spiritually superior, regardless of what other people think or do. Hold to your true aspirations no matter what is going on around you.","It is not he who gives abuse that affronts, but the view that we take of it as insulting; so that when one provokes you it is your own opinion which is provoking.","What is it that every man seeks? To be secure, to be happy, to do what he pleases without restraint and without compulsion.","First learn the meaning of what you say, and then speak.","We should do everything both cautiously and confidently at the same time.","It doesn\'t take much to lose everything, just a little departure from reason","Wish that everything should come about just as it does.","The world turns aside to let any man pass who knows where he is going.","If you seek truth you will not seek victory by dishonorable means, and if you find truth you will become invincible.","To get or not to get what we desire can be equally disappointing.","Although we can\'t control which roles are assigned to us, it must be our business to act our given role as best we possibly can and to refrain from complaining about it. Where ever you find yourself and in whatever circumstances, give an impeccable performance.","Imagine for yourself a character, a model personality, whose example you determine to follow, in private as well as in public.","Appearances to the mind are of four kinds. Things either are what they appear to be; or they neither are, nor appear to be; or they are, and do not appear to be; or they are not, and yet appear to be. Rightly to aim in all these cases is the wise man\'s task.","Man is troubled not by events, but by the meaning he gives them.","Don\'t seek to have events happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do happen, and all will be well with you.","These reasonings are unconnected: \\"I am richer than you, therefore I am better\\"; \\"I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better.\\" The connection is rather this: \\"I am richer than you, therefore my property is greater than yours;\\" \\"I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than yours.\\" But you, after all, are neither property nor style.","First tell yourself what you want to be, then do what you need to do.","Nothing great is produced suddenly, since not even the grape or the fig is. If you say to me now that you want a fig, I will answer to you that it requires time: let it flower first, then put forth fruit, and then ripen.","God has made all men to be happy.","Authentic happiness is always independent of external conditions. Vigilantly practice polite indifference to that which we can\'t control. Your happiness can only be found within.","I must die. I must be imprisoned. I must suffer exile. But must I die groaning? Must I whine as well? Can anyone hinder me from going into exile with a smile? The master threatens to chain me: what say you? Chain me? My leg you will chain--yes, but not my will--no, not even Zeus can conquer that.","Never say about anything, \\"I have lost it,\\" but only \\"I have given it back.\\" Is your child dead? It has been given back. Is your wife dead? She has been returned.","If you hear that someone is speaking ill of you, instead of trying to defend yourself you should say: \'He obviously does not know me very well, since there are so many other faults he could have mentioned.\'","If you seek Truth, you will not seek to gain a victory by every possible means; and when you have found Truth, you need not fear being defeated.","If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid with regard to external things. Don\'t wish to be thought to know anything; and even if you appear to be somebody important to others, distrust yourself. For, it is difficult to both keep your faculty of choice in a state conformable to nature, and at the same time acquire external things. But while you are careful about the one, you must of necessity neglect the other","Remember that you are but an actor, acting whatever part the Master has ordained. It may be short or it may be long. If he wishes you to represent a poor man, do so heartily; if a cripple, or a magistrate, or a private man, in each case act your part with honor.","Lampis the ship owner, on being asked how he acquired his great wealth, replied, My great wealth was acquired with no difficulty, but my small wealth, my first gains, with much labor.","When you actively engage in gradually refining yourself, you retreat from your lazy ways of covering yourself or making excuses. Instead of feeling a persistent current of low-level shame, you move forward by using the creative possibilities of this moment, your current situation.","It is better to die of hunger having lived without grief and fear, than to live with a troubled spirit, amid abundance","If you set your heart upon philosophy, you must straightway prepare yourself to be laughed at and mocked by many who will say Behold a philosopher arisen among us! or How came you by that brow of scorn? But do you cherish no scorn, but hold to those things which seem to you the best, as one set by God in that place. Remember too, that if you abide in those ways, those who first mocked you, the same shall afterwards reverence you; but if you yield to them, you will be laughed at twice as much as before.","A half-hearted spirit has no power. Tentative efforts lead to tentative outcomes. Average people enter into their endeavors headlong and without care.","All human beings seek the happy life, but many confuse the means - for example, wealth and status - with that life itself.  This misguided focus on the means to a good life makes people get further from the happy life.  The really worthwhile things are the virtuous activities that make up the happy life, not the external means that may seem to produce it.","The foolish and the uneducated have little use for freedom. Only the educated are free.","Men are disturbed not by the things that happen, but by their opinion of the things that happen.","He who exercises wisdom exercises the knowledge which is about God.","When we name things correctly, we comprehend them correctly, without adding information or judgements that aren\'t there.  Does someone bathe quickly?  Don\'t say be bathes poorly, but quickly.  Name the situation as it is, don\'t filter it through your judgments.  Give your assent only to that which is actually true.","We all dread a bodily paralysis, and would make use of every contrivance to avoid it; but none of us is troubled about a paralysis of the soul.","Sickness is a hindrance to the body, but not to your ability to choose, unless that is your choice. Lameness is a hindrance to the leg, but not to your ability to choose. Say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens, then you will see such obstacles as hindrances to something else, but not to yourself.","At this time is freedom anything but the right to live as we wish? Nothing else.","By accepting life\'s limits and inevitabilities and working with them rather than fighting them, we become free.","Embrace reality. Think about what delights you - the small luxuries on which you depend, the people whom you cherish most. But remember that they have their own distinct character, which is quite a separate matter from how we happen to regard them.","Who is not attracted by bright and pleasant children, to prattle, to creep, and to play with them?","Dare to look up to God and say, Deal with me in the future as Thou wilt; I am of the same mind as Thou art; I am Thine; I refuse nothing that pleases Thee; lead me where Thou wilt; clothe me in any dress Thou choosest.","Neither the victories of the Olympic Games nor those achieved in battles make the man happy. The only victories that make him happy are those achieved against himself. Temptations and tests are combats. You have beaten one, two, many times; still fight. If you defeat at last you will be happy your entire life, as if you have always defeated.","Give yourself fully to your endeavors. Decide to construct your character through excellent actions and determine to pay the price of a worthy goal. The trials you encounter will introduce you to your strengths.","Tentative efforts lead to tentative outcome.","Events do not just happen, but arrive by appointment.","It is a mark of a mean capacity to spend much time on the things which concern the body, such as much exercise, much eating, much drinking, much easing of the body, much copulation. But these things should be done as subordinate things: and let all your care be directed to the mind.","He who is not happy with little will never be happy with much.","Living a good life leads to enduring happiness. Goodness in and of itself is the practice AND the reward.","The cause of all human evils is the not being able to apply general principles to special cases.","What is yours is to play the assigned part well. But to choose it belongs to someone else","Circumstances don\'t make the man, they only reveal him to himself.","Difficulty shows what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. Why? So that you may become an Olympic conqueror; but it is not accomplished without sweat.","You bear God within you, poor wretch, and know it not.","It is my business, to manage carefully and dexterously whatever happens","Envy is the antagonist of the fortunate.","A soul that makes virtue its companion is like an over-flowing well, for it is clean and pellucid, sweet and wholesome, open to all, rich, blameless and indestructible.","Any one thing in the creation is sufficient to demonstrate a Providence to a humble and grateful mind.","The best place to get help is from yourself.","When you let go of your attention for a little while, do not think you may recover it whenever you please.","When one maintains his proper attitude in life, he does not long after externals.","Fortify yourself with contentment, for this is an impregnable fortress.","All religions must be tolerated for every man must get to heaven in his own way.","It is the sign of a dull mind to dwell upon the cares of the body, to prolong exercise, eating and drinking and other bodily functions. These things are best done by the way; all your attention must be given to the mind.","Watch yourself as you go about your daily business and later reflect on what you saw, trying to identify the sources of distress in your life and thinking about how to avoid that distress.","Be free from grief not through insensibility like the irrational animals, nor through want of thought like the foolish, but like a man of virtue by having reason as the consolation of grief.","Caretake this moment. Immerse yourself in its particulars. Respond to this person, this challenge, this deed. Quit evasions. Stop giving yourself needless trouble. It is time to really live; to fully inhabit the situation you happen to be in now.","It is not death or pain that is to be dreaded, but the fear of pain or death.","Each man\'s life is a kind of campaign, and a long and complicated one at that. You have to maintain the character of a soldier, and do each separate act at the bidding of the General.","Whenever you are angry, be assured that it is not only a present evil, but that you have increased a habit.","If you wish to live a life free from sorrow, think of what is going to happen as if it had already happened.","You know yourself what you are worth in your own eyes; and at what price you will sell yourself. For men sell themselves at various prices. This is why, when Florus was deliberating whether he should appear at Nero\'s shows, taking part in the performance himself, Agrippinus replied, \'Appear by all means.\' And when Florus inquired, \'But why do not you appear?\' he answered, \'Because I do not even consider the question.\'","Remember that you ought to behave in life as you would at a banquet. As something is being passed around it comes to you; stretch out your hand, take a portion of it politely. It passes on; do not detain it. Or it has not come to you yet; do not project your desire to meet it, but wait until it comes in front of you. So act toward children, so toward a wife, so toward office, so toward wealth.","On the occasion of every accident that befalls you, remember to turn to yourself and inquire what power you have for turning it to use.","Don\'t demand or expect that events happen as you would wish them do.  Accept events as they actually happen.  That way, peace is possible.","If someone irritates you, it is only your own response that is irritating you. Therefore, when anyone seems to be provoking you, remember that it is only your judgment of the incident that provokes you. -","Truth is a thing immortal and perpetual, and it gives to us a beauty that fades not away in time, nor does it take away the freedom of speech which proceeds from justice; but it gives to us the knowledge of what is just and lawful, separating from them the unjust and refuting them.","Everything has two handles; the one soft and manageable, the other such as will not endure to be touched. If then your brother do you an injury, do not take it by the hot hard handle, by representing to yourself all the aggravating circumstances of the fact; but look rather on the soft side, and extenuate it as much as is possible, by considering the nearness of the relation, and the long friendship and familiarity between you--obligations to kindness which a single provocation ought not to dissolve. And thus you will take the accident by its manageable handle.","He is free who lives as he wishes to live; who is neither subject to compulsion nor to hindrance, nor to force; whose movements to action are not impeded, whose desires attain their purpose, and who does not fall into that which he would avoid.","You are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be.","In life our first job is this, to divide and distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them I do control. Where will I find good and bad? In me, in my choices.","Do nothing in a depressed mood, nor as one afflicted, nor as thinking that you are in misery, for no one compels you to that.","We need to regularly stop and take stock; to sit down and determine within ourselves which things are worth valuing and which things are not; which risks are worth the cost and which are not. Even the most confusing or hurtful aspects of life can be made more tolerable by clear seeing and by choice.","It takes more than just a good looking body. You\'ve got to have the heart and soul to go with it.","Happiness is an equivalent for all troublesome things.","The greater the difficulty the more glory in surmounting it. Skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.","Seek not the good in external things;seek it in yourselves.","The good or ill of a man lies within his own will.","What really frightens and dismays us is not external events themselves, but the way in which we think about them.  It is not things that disturb us, but our interpretation of their significance.","The soul is unwillingly deprived of truth.","No man is able to make progress when he is wavering between opposite things.","Fight against yourself, recover yourself to decency, to modesty, to freedom. And, in the first place, condemn your actions; but when you have condemned them, do not despair of yourself. For both ruin and recovery are from within.","If you think you control things that are in the control of others, you will lament. You will be disturbed and you will blame both gods and men.","If you desire to be good, begin by believing that you are wicked.","Contentment, as it is a short road and pleasant, has great delight and little trouble.","The two powers which in my opinion constitute a wise man are those of bearing and forbearing.","The flourishing life cannot be achieved until we moderate our desires and see how superficial and fleeting they are.","In prosperity it is very easy to find a friend; but in adversity it is the most difficult of all things.","Only the educated are free.","We should not have either a blunt knife or a freedom of speech which is ill-managed.","It is impossible to begin to learn that which one thinks one already knows.","When any person treats you ill or speaks ill of you, remember that he does this or says this because he thinks it is his duty. It is not possible, then, for him to follow that which seems right to you, but that which seems right to himself.","If I can acquire money and also keep myself modest and faithful and magnanimous, point out the way, and I will acquire it.","Our duties naturally emerge form such fundamental relations as our families, neighborhoods, workplaces, our state or nation. Make it your regular habit to consider your roles-parent, child, neighbor, citizen, leader-and the natural duties that arise from them. Once you know who you are and to whom you are linked, you will know what to do.","Be not diverted from your duty by any idle reflections the silly world may make upon you, for their censures are not in your power and should not be at all your concerns.","To the rational being only the irrational is unendurable, but the rational is endurable.","Know you not that a good man does nothing for appearance sake, but for the sake of having done right?","No great thing is created suddenly.","To pay homage to beauty is to admire Nature; to admire Nature is to worship God","There is but one way to tranquility of mind and happiness, and that is to account no external things thine own, but to commit all to God.","Exceed due measure, and the most delightful things become the least delightful.","Practice yourself, for heaven\'s sake, in little things, and thence proceed to greater.","From now on practice saying to everything that appears unpleasant: You are merely an appearance and NOT what you appear to be.","The origin of sorrow is this: to wish for something that does not come to pass.","What else can I do, a lame old man, but sing hymns to God?  If I were a nightingale, I would do the nightingale\'s part; if I were a swan, I would do as a swan.  But now I am a rational creature, and I ought to praise God.  This is my work.  I do it, nor will I desert my post, so long as I am allowed to keep it.  And I ask you to join me in this same song.","Freedom and slavery, the one is the name of virtue, and the other of vice, and both are acts of the will.","If a person had delivered up your body to some passer-by, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in delivering up your own mind to any reviler, to be disconcerted and confounded?","Seek not good from without; seek it within yourselves, or you will never find it.","A vulgar man, in any ill that happens to him, blames others; a novice in philosophy blames himself; and a philosopher blames neither, the one nor the other.","Is freedom anything else than the power of living as we choose? Nothing else. Tell me then, you men, do you wish to live in error? We do not. No one who lives in error is free. Do you wish to live in fear? Do you wish to live in sorrow? Do you wish to live in tension? By no means. No one who is in a state of fear or sorrow or tension is free, but whoever is delivered from sorrows or fears or anxieties, he is at the same time also delivered from servitude.","What ought one to say then as each hardship comes? I was practicing for this, I was training for this.","People are not disturbed by things, but by the view they take of them.","If you can make music with someone you don\'t need words.\\nIf you wish to be a writer, write.","Choose the life that is noblest, for custom can make it sweet to thee.","At every occasion in your life, do not forget to commune with\\nyourself and ask of yourself how you can profit by it.","Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible be daily before your eyes, but chiefly death, and you win never entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.","Never call yourself a philosopher, nor talk a great deal among the unlearned about theorems, but act conformably to them.

Well, the fact is that some of us are wild beasts of a larger size, while others are little animals, malignant and petty.","It is not my place in society that makes me well off, but my judgements, and these I can carry with me... These alone are my own and cannot be taken away.","If what charms you is nothing but abstract principles, sit down and turn them over quietly in your mind: but never dub yourself a Philosopher.","One of the best ways to elevate your character is to emulate worthy role models","It is the nature of the wise to resist pleasures, but the foolish to be a slave to them.","Who are those people by whom you wish to be admired?

Do you wish to be admired by the mad?","Whoever wants to be free, therefore, let him not want or avoid anything that is up to others. Otherwise he will necessarily be a slave.","If thou rememberest that God standeth by to behold and visit all that thou doest; whether in the body or in the soul, thou surely wilt not err in any prayer or deed; and thou shalt have God to dwell with thee.","To accuse others for one\'s own misfortunes is a sign of want of education.

You will have to put yourself under discipline; to eat by rule, to avoid cakes and sweetmeats; to take exercise at the appointed hour whether you like it or not, in cold and heat; to abstain from cold drinks and wine at your will.

The person who followed these precepts would achieve happiness.","Getting distracted by trifles is the easiest thing in the world\u2026 Focus on your main duty","We do not choose our own parts in life, and have nothing to do with those parts. Our duty is confined to playing them well.","Cowardice, the dread of what will happen.","Liars are the cause of all the sins and crimes in the world.","Covetousness like jealousy, when it has taken root, never leaves a person, but with their life. Cowardice is the dread of what will happen.","If thy brother wrongs thee, remember not so much his wrong-doing, but more than ever that he is thy brother.","It is not the events but our viewpoint toward events that is the determining factor. We ought to be more concerned about removing wrong thoughts from the mind than removing tumors and abscesses from the body.","It is difficulties that show what men are.","We must ever bear in mind --that apart from the will there is nothing good or bad, and that we must not try to anticipate or to direct events, but merely to accept them with intelligence.","It is unreasonable to think we can earn rewards without being willing to pay their true price.

No man is free who is not master of himself. A man should so live that his happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things. The world turns aside to let any man pass who knows where he is going.","We are not to give credit to the many, who say that none ought to be educated but the free; but rather to the philosophers, who say that the well-educated alone are free.","When a man is proud because he can understand and explain the writings of Chrysippus, say to yourself, \'if Chrysippus had not written obscurely, this man would have had nothing to be proud of.\'","Not things, but opinions about things, trouble men.","It were no slight attainment could we merely fulfil what the nature of man implies.","Common and vulgar people ascribe all ills that they feel to others; people of little wisdom ascribe to themselves; people of much wisdom, to no one.","Whatever you would make habitual, practice it; and if you would not make a thing habitual, do not practice it, but accustom yourself to something else.","A thing either is what it appears to be; or it is not, but yet appears to be; or it is, but does not appear to be; or it is not, and does not appear to be.","To be getting an education means this: to be learning what is your own, and what is not your own.","If any be unhappy, let him remember that he is unhappy by reason of himself alone.

Your own purpose should seek harmony with nature itself.

Before you proceed, step back and look at the big picture, lest you act rashly on raw impulse.","The soul\'s impurity consists in bad judgements, and purification consists in producing in it right judgements, and the pure soul is one which has right judgements, for this alone is proof against confusion and pollution in its functions.","Do not laugh much or often or unrestrainedly.","It has been ordained that there be summer and winter, abundance and dearth, virtue and vice, and all such opposites for the harmony of the whole, and (Zeus) has given each of us a body, property, and companions.","Of pleasures, those which occur most rarely give the most delight.","What disturbs and alarms man are not the things, but his opinions and fancies about the things.","Men are not worried by things, but by their ideas about things.

When death appears as an evil, we ought immediately to remember that evils are things to be avoided, but death is inevitable.","If anyone should tell you that a particular person has spoken critically of you, don\'t bother with excuses or defenses. Just smile and reply, \\"I guess that person doesn\'t know about all my other faults. Otherwise, he wouldn\'t have mentioned only these.\\"","Asked, Who is the rich man? Epictetus replied, \ufffdHe who is content.","As it is pleasant to see the sea from the land, so it is pleasant for him who has escaped from troubles to think of them.","Pain or pleasure? I say pleasure.","Your master is he who controls that on which you have set your heart or wish to avoid.","It is impossible that happiness, and yearning for what is not present, should ever be united.","When you want to hear a philosopher, do not say, \'You say nothing to me\'; only show yourself worthy or fit to hear, and then you will see how you will move the speaker.","Let no man think that he is loved by any who loveth none.","One that desires to excel should endeavor in those things that are in themselves most excellent.","Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can, but does not want to.","We are not disturbed by what happens to us, but by our thoughts about what happens to us.","Forgiveness is better than revenge, for forgiveness is the sign of a gentle nature, but revenge is the sign of a savage nature. the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace.","If one oversteps the bounds of moderation, the greatest pleasures cease to please.","Remember that you are an actor in a drama of such sort as the Author chooses: if short, then in a short one; if long, then in a long one. If it be His pleasure that you should enact a poor man, or a cripple, or a ruler, or a private citizen, see that you act it well. For this is your business, to act well the given part. But to choose it belongs to Another.","Think of God more often than thou breathest.","Inner peace begins when we stop saying of things, \'I have lost it\' and instead say, \'It has been returned to where it came from.\'  Why should it be any concern of yours who gives your things back to the world that gave them to you?  The important thing is to take great care with what you have while the world lets you have it.","It is the part of an uneducated person to blame others where he himself fares ill; to blame himself is the part of one whose education has begun; to blame neither another nor his own self is the part of one whose education is already complete.","Two principles we should always have ready \u2014 that there is nothing good or evil save in the will; and that we are not to lead events, but to follow them.","You can be invincible, if you enter into no contest in which it is not in your power to conquer.","It is better to advise than upbraid, for the one corrects the erring; the other only convicts them.","Let thy speech of God be renewed day by day, aye, rather than thy meat and drink.","In every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then undertake it","It is wicked to withdraw from being useful to the needy, and cowardly to give way to the worthless.","What will the world be quite overturned when you die?","You ought to choose both physician and friend, not the most agreeable, but the most useful.","There is nothing good or evil save in the will.","Nothing great is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig.","When you close your doors, and make darkness within, remember never to say that you are alone, for you are not alone; nay, God is within, and your genius is within. And what need have they of light to see what you are doing?","No greater thing is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig.

Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen.","I am not eternity, but a man; a part of the whole, as an hour is of the day.","Do not so much be ashamed of that disgrace which proceeds from men\'s opinion as fly from that which comes from the truth.","The universe is but one great city, full of beloved ones, divine and human, by nature endeared to each other.","We ought to flee the friendship of the wicked, and the enmity of the good.","It is better by assenting to truth to conquer opinion, than by assenting to opinion to be conquered by truth.","Crows pick out the eyes of the dead, when the dead have no longer need of them; but flatterers mar the soul of the living, and her eyes they blind.","When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. An uninstructed person will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on himself.","The soul that companies with virtue is like an ever-flowing source. It is a pure, clear, and wholesome draught, sweet, rich and generous of its store, that injures not, neither destroys.","Act well your given part; the choice rests not with you.","If you would be well spoken of, learn to be well-spoken; and having learnt to be well- spoken, strive also to be well-doing; so shall you succeed in being well spoken of.","Difficulty shows what men are.","In theory there is nothing to hinder our following what we are taught;but in life there are many things to draw us aside.","As a man, casting off worn out garments taketh new ones, so the dweller in the body, entereth into ones that are new.","Nature hath given men one tongue but two ears, that we may hear from others twice as much as we speak.","If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.","It is not events that disturb the minds of men, but the view they take of them.","If I was a nightingale I would sing like a nightingale; if a swan, like a swan. But since I am a rational creature my role is to praise God.","What is death? A scary mask. Take it off-see, it doesn\'t bite.","If you would cure anger, do not feed it.

If you have anything better to be doing when you are so overtaken, get to work on that.","Not every difficult and dangerous thing is suitable for training, but only that which is conducive to success in achieving the object of our effort.","In theory it is easy to convince an ignorant person; in actual life, men not only object to offer themselves to be convinced, but hate the man who has convinced them.","Do not give sentence in another tribunal till you have been yourself judged in the tribunal of Justice.","Bid a singer in a chorus, Know Thyself; and will he not turn for the knowledge to the others, his fellows in the chorus, and to his harmony with them?","Remember that you are an actor in a play, and that the Playwright chooses the manner of it: If he wants you to act a poor man you must act the part with all your powers; and so if your part be a cripple or a magistrate or a plain man.

A third party attribute to it existence and forethought, but only for great and heavenly matters, not for anything that is on earth. A fourth party admit things on earth as well as in heaven, but only in general, and not with respect to each individual.

Why then are you ignorant of your high birth?","What thou avoidest suffering thyself seek not to impose on others.","A guide, on finding a man who has lost his way, brings him back to the right path\u2014he does not mock and jeer at him and then take himself off.

You have been given the principles that you ought to endorse, and you have endorsed them. What kind of teacher, then, are you still waiting for in order to refer your self-improvement to him? You are no longer a boy, but a full-grown man. If you are careless and lazy now and keep putting things off and always deferring the day after which you will attend to yourself, you will not notice that you are making no progress, but you will live and die as someone quite ordinary. From now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer, and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event. That is how Socrates fulfilled himself by attending to nothing except reason in everything he encountered.

It is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control.","People are not disturbed by things, but by the views they take of them.","Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it easier to maintain control.","You are a little soul carrying around a corpse","To accuse others for one\'s own misfortune is a sign of want of education. To accuse oneself shows that one\'s education has begun. To accuse neither oneself nor others shows that one\'s education is complete.","\u03a4\u03af\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c0\u03ad: \u03b5\u1f36\u03b8\' \u03bf\u1f55\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f03 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2. (First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.)","The greater the difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it. Skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.","Most of what passes for legitimate entertainment is inferior or foolish and only caters to or exploits people\'s weaknesses. Avoid being one of the mob who indulges in such pastimes. Your life is too short and you have important things to do. Be discriminating about what images and ideas you permit into your mind. If you yourself don\'t choose what thoughts and images you expose yourself to, someone else will, and their motives may not be the highest. It is the easiest thing in the world to slide imperceptibly into vulgarity. But there\'s no need for that to happen if you determine not to waste your time and attention on mindless pap.","Now is the time to get serious about living your ideals. How long can you afford to put off who you really want to be? Your nobler self cannot wait any longer. Put your principles into practice \u2013 now. Stop the excuses and the procrastination. This is your life! You aren\u2019t a child anymore. The sooner you set yourself to your spiritual program, the happier you will be. The longer you wait, the more you\u2019ll be vulnerable to mediocrity and feel filled with shame and regret, because you know you are capable of better. From this instant on, vow to stop disappointing yourself. Separate yourself from the mob. Decide to be extraordinary and do what you need to do \u2013 now.","If evil be said of thee, and if it be true, correct thyself; if it be a lie, laugh at it.","Small-minded people blame others. Average people blame themselves. The wise see all blame as foolishness","A ship should not ride on a single anchor, nor life on a singlehope","Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our actions. The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.","You know yourself what you are worth in your own eyes; and at what price you will sell yourself. For men sell themselves at various prices. This is why, when Florus was deliberating whether he should appear at Nero\'s shows, taking part in the performance himself, Agrippinus replied, \'Appear by all means.\' And when Florus inquired, \'But why do not you appear?\' he answered, \'Because I do not even consider the question.\' For the man who has once stooped to consider such questions, and to reckon up the value of external things, is not far from forgetting what manner of man he is.","Never depend on the admiration of others. There is no strength in it. Personal merit cannot be derived from an external source. It is not to be found in your personal associations, nor can it be found in the regard of other people. It is a fact of life that other people, even people who love you, will not necessarily agree with your ideas, understand you, or share your enthusiasms. Grow up! Who cares what other people think about you!","What really frightens and dismays us is not external events themselves, but the way in which we think about them. It is not things that disturb us, but our interpretation of their significance.","You become what you give your attention to.","Demand not that things happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do, and you will go on well.","It is not so much what happens to you as how you think about what happens.","Asked, Who is the rich man? Epictetus replied, \x93He who is content.","Even as the Sun doth not wait for prayers and incantations torise, but shines forth and is welcomed by all: so thou also waitnot for clapping of hands and shouts and praise to do thy duty;nay, do good of thine own accord, and thou wilt be loved like theSun.","Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things. Thus death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own views. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and of one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others or himself.","Tentative efforts lead to tentative outcomes. Therefore, give yourself fully to your endeavors. Decide to construct your character through excellent actions and determine to pay the price of a worthy goal. The trials you encounter will introduce you to your strengths. Remain steadfast...and one day you will build something that endures: something worthy of your potential.","If you want to make progress, put up with being perceived as ignorant or naive in worldly matters, don\'t aspire to a reputation for sagacity. If you do impress others as somebody, don\'t altogether believe it. You have to realize, it isn\'t easy to keep your will in agreement with nature, as well as externals. Caring about the one inevitably means you are going to shortchange the other.","Remember to act always as if you were at a symposium. When the food or drink comes around, reach out and take some politely; if it passes you by don\'t try pulling it back. And if it has not reached you yet, don\'t let your desire run ahead of you, be patient until your turn comes. Adopt a similar attitude with regard to children, wife, wealth and status, and in time, you will be entitled to dine with the gods. Go further and decline these goods even when they are on offer and you will have a share in the gods\' power as well as their company. That is how Diogenes, Heraclitus and philosophers like them came to be called, and considered, divine.","-\u2026.when things seem to have reached that stage, merely say \u201cI won\u2019t play any longer, and take your departure; but if you stay, stop lamenting.\u201d","Your happiness depends on three things, all of which are within your power: your will, your ideas concerning the events in which you are involved, and the use you make of your ideas.","Give me by all means the shorter and nobler life, instead of onethat is longer but of less account!","It is unrealistc to expect people to see you as you see yourself.","No great thing is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen.","Freedom is secured not by the fulfilling of men\'s desires, but by the removal of desire.","Nature hath given men one tongue but two ears, that we mayhear from others twice as much as we speak.","Control thy passions lest they take vengence on thee. ~ Epictetus","-Who are those people by whom you wish to be admired? Are they not these whom you are in the habit of saying that they are mad? What then? Do you wish to be admired by the mad?","No person is free who is not master of himself.","The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.","The first and most important field of philosophy is the application of principles such as \u201cDo not lie. Next come the proofs, such as why we should not lie. The third field supports and articulates the proofs, by asking, for example, \u201cHow does this prove it? What exactly is a proof, what is logical inference, what is contradiction, what is truth, what is falsehood?\u201d Thus, the third field is necessary because of the second, and the second because of the first. The most important, though, the one that should occupy most of our time, is the first. But we do just the opposite. We are preoccupied with the third field and give that all our attention, passing the first by altogether. The result is that we lie \u2013 but have no difficulty proving why we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d","Don\'t hope that events will turn out the way you want, welcome events in whichever way they happen: this is the path to peace.","If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid with regard to external things. Don\'t wish to be thought to know anything; and even if you appear to be somebody important to others, distrust yourself.","What would have become of Hercules do you think if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar - and no savage criminals to rid the world of? What would he have done in the absence of such challenges? Obviously he would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules. And even if he had, what good would it have done him? What would have been the use of those arms, that physique, and that noble soul, without crises or conditions to stir into him action?","It is more necessary for the soul to be cured than the body; for it is better to die than to live badly.","It is better to do wrong seldom and to own it, and to act right for the most part, than seldom to admit that you have done wrong and to do wrong often.","We must not believe the many, who say that only free people ought to be educated, but we should rather believe the philosophers who say that only the educated are free.","Do not afflict others with anything that you yourself would not wish to suffer. if you would not like to be a slave, make sure no one is your slave. If you have slaves, you yourself are the greatest slave, for just as freedom is incompatible with slavery, so goodness is incompatible with hypocrisy.","Is freedom anything else than the right to live as we wish? Nothing else.","Epictetus being asked how a man should give pain to his enemy answered, By preparing himself to live the best life that he can.","We suffer not from the events in our lives but from our judgement about them.","Do not try to seem wise to others. If you want to live a wise life, live it on your own terms and in your own eyes.","What concerns me is not the way things are, but the way people think things are.","Remember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand, and take a moderate share. Does it pass you? Do not stop it. Is it not come yet? Do not yearn in desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children , wife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods. And if you do not so much as take the things which are set before you, but are able even to forego them, then you will not only be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them also. For, by thus doing, Diogenes and Heraclitus, and others like them, deservedly became divine, and were so recognized.","When any person harms you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he acts or speaks from a supposition of its being his duty. Now, it is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from a wrong appearance, he is the person hurt, since he too is the person deceived. For if anyone should suppose a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but he who is deceived about it. Setting out, then, from these principles, you will meekly bear a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, \\"It seemed so to him.\\"....","Don\'t live by your own rules, but in harmony with nature","God save me from fools with a little philosophy\u2014no one is more difficult to reach.","Sickness is a problem for the body, not the mind \u2014 unless the mind decides that it is a problem. Lameness, too, is the body\'s problem, not the mind\'s. Say this to yourself whatever the circumstance and you will find without fail that the problem pertains to something else, not to you.","In banquets remember that you entertain two guests, body and soul: and whatever you shall have given to the body you soon eject: but what you shall have given to the soul, you keep always.","These reasonings do not cohere: I am richer than you, therefore I am better than you; I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better than you. On the contrary these rather cohere, I am richer than you, therefore my possessions are greater than yours: I am more eloquent than you, therefore my speech is superior to yours. But you are neither possession nor speech.","The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own...","If they are wise, do not quarrel with them; if they are fools, ignore them.","As the sun does not wait for prayers and incantations tob e induced to rise, but immediately shines and is saluted by all, so do you also not wait for clappings of hands and shouts of praise tob e induced to do good, but be a doer of good voluntarily and you will be beloved as much as the sun.","Concerning the Gods, there are those who deny the very existence of the Godhead; others say that it exists, but neither bestirs nor concerns itself not has forethought far anything. A third party attribute to it existence and forethought, but only for great and heavenly matters, not for anything that is on earth. A fourth party admit things on earth as well as in heaven, but only in general, and not with respect to each individual. A fifth, of whom were Ulysses and Socrates, are those that cry: --I move not without Thy knowledge!","We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them","Who then is invincible? The one who cannot be upset by anything outside their reasoned choice.","Don\'t put your purpose in one place and expect to see progress made somewhere else.","Man, what are you talking about? Me in chains? You may fetter my leg but my will, not even Zeus himself can overpower.","So what oppresses and scares us? It is our own thoughts, obviously, What overwhelms people when they are about to leaves friends, family, old haunts and their accustomed way of life? Thoughts.","Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but by the opinion about the things.","Those who are well constituted in the body endure both heat and cold: and so those who are well constituted in the soul endure both anger and grief and excessive joy and the other affects.","A city is not adorned by external things, but by the virtue of those who dwell in it.","[Do not get too attached to life] for it is like a sailor\'s leave on the shore and at any time, the captain may sound the horn, calling you back to eternal darkness.","Very little is needed for everything to be upset and ruined, only a slight lapse in reason.","Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things.","Caretake this moment. Immerse yourself in its particulars. Respond to this person, this challenge, this deed. Quit the evasions. Stop giving yourself needless trouble. It is time to really live; to fully inhabit the situation you happen to be in now. You are not some disinterested bystander. Participate. Exert yourself.","For even sheep do not vomit up their grass and show to the shepherds how much they have eaten; but when they have internally digested the pasture, they produce externally wool and milk. Do you also show not your theorems to the uninstructed, but show the acts which come from their digestion.","Why do you want to read anyway \u2013 for the sake of amusement or mere erudition? Those are poor, fatuous pretexts. Reading should serve the goal of attaining peace; if it doesn\u2019t make you peaceful, what good is it?","Everyone\'s life is a warfare, and that long and various.","For sheep don\'t throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk.","You will do the greatest services to the state, if you shall raise not the roofs of the houses, but the souls of the citizens: for it is better that great souls should dwell in small houses than for mean slaves to lurk in great houses.","What then, is it not possible to be free from faults? It is not possible; but this is possible: to direct your efforts incessantly to being faultess. For we must be content if by never remitting this attention we shall escape at least a few errors. When you have said \\"Tomorrow I will begin to attend,\\" you must be told that you are saying this: \\"Today I will be shameless, disregardful of time and place, mean;it will be in the power of others to give me pain, today I will be passionate and envious.See how many evil things you are permitting yourself to do. If it is good to use attention tomorrow, how much better is it to do so today? If tomorrow it is in your interest to attend, much more is it today, that you may be able to do so tomorrow also, and may not defer it again to the third day.","The philosopher\'s school, ye men, is a surgery: you ought not to go out of it with pleasure, but with pain. For you are not in sound health when you enter.","We are at the mercy of whoever wields authority over the things we either desire or detest. If you would be free, then, do not wish to have, or avoid, things that other people control, because then you must serve as their slave.","Whoever then would be free, let him wish for nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others; else he must necessarily be a slave.","If you want to improve, you must be content to be thought foolish and stupid.","There is no shame in making an honest effort.","Remind thyself that he whom thou lovest is mortal \x97 that whatthou lovest is not thine own; it is given thee for the present, notirrevocably nor for ever, but even as a fig or a bunch of grapes atthe appointed season of the year","It is a universal law \u2014 have no illusion \u2014 that every creature alive is attached to nothing so much as to its own self-interest.","Freedom is not archived by satisfying desire, but by eliminating it.","If someone tried to take control of your body and make you a slave, you would fight for freedom. Yet how easily you hand over your mind to anyone who insults you. When you dwell on their words and let them dominate your thoughts, you make them your master.","First say to yourself what you would be, and then do what you have to do.","When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, never shrink from being seen to do it, even though the world should misunderstand it; for if you are not acting rightly, shun the action itself; if you are, why fear those who wrongly censure you?","no man is free until he s a master of himself!!","Whenever anyone criticizes or wrongs you, remember that they are only doing or saying what they think is right. They cannot be guided by your views, only their own; so if their views are wrong, they are the ones who suffer insofar as they are misguided.","The condition and characteristic of an uninstructed person is this: he never expects from himself profit (advantage) nor harm, but from externals. The condition and characteristic of a philosopher is this: he expects all advantage and all harm from himself.","this is your business\u2014to act well the given part, but to choose it belongs to another.","An uninstructed person will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on himself.","Never say that I have taken it, only that I have given it back.","For it is not death or pain that is to be feared, but the fear of pain or death.","When someone is properly grounded in life, they shouldn\'t have to look outside themselves for approval.","Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man, otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper subject-matter. For as the material of the carpenter is wood, and that of statuary bronze, so the subject-matter of the art of living is each person\'s own life.","Man is troubled not by events, but by the meaning he gives to them.","What are we to do, then? To make the best of what lies within our power, and deal with everything else as it comes. \u2018How does it come, then?\u2019 As God wills.","Sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy.","No one is ever unhappy because of someone else.","Some young women confuse their self-worth with their ability to attract the attention of men, and so pour all their energies into makeup, clothing, and jewelry. If only they realized that virtue, honor, and self-respect are the marks of a true beauty.","If you wish your house to be well managed, imitate the Spartan Lycurgus. For as he did not fence his city with walls, but fortified the inhabitants by virtue and preserved the city always free;35 so do you not cast around (your house) a large court and raise high towers, but strengthen the dwellers by good-will and fidelity and friendship, and then nothing harmful will enter it, not even if the whole band of wickedness shall array itself against it.","Keep the prospect of death, exile and all such apparent tragedies before you every day \u2013 especially death \u2013 and you will never have an abject thought, or desire anything to excess.","These reasonings have no logical connection: \\"I am richer than you; therefore I am your superior.\\" \\"I am more eloquent than you; therefore I am your superior.\\" The true logical connection is rather this: \\"I am richer than you; therefore my possessions must exceed yours.\\" \\"I am more eloquent than you; therefore my style must surpass yours.\\" But you, after all, consist in neither property nor in style.","Many people who have progressively lowered their personal standards in an attempt to win social\xa0acceptance and life\u2019s comforts bitterly resent those\xa0of philosophical bent who refuse to compromise\xa0their spiritual ideals and who seek to better themselves.","If a man has reported to you, that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make any defense to what has been told you: but reply, The man did not know the rest of my faults, for he would not have mentioned these only.","You ought to realize, you take up very little space in the world as a whole\u2014your body, that is; in reason, however, you yield to no one, not even to the gods, because reason is not measured in size but sense. So why not care for that side of you, where you and the gods are equals?","If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the pleasure of any one, be assured that you have ruined your scheme of life. Be contented, then, in everything, with being a philosopher; and if you with to seem so likewise to any one, appear so to yourself, and it will suffice you.","You should be especially careful when associating with one of your former friends or acquaintances not to sink to their level; otherwise you will lose yourself. If you are troubled by the idea that \u2018He\u2019ll think I\u2019m boring and won\u2019t treat me the way he used to,\u2019 remember that everything comes at a price. It isn\u2019t possible to change your behavior and still be the same person you were before.","People with a strong physical constitution can tolerate extremes of hot and cold; people of strong mental health can handle anger, grief, joy and the other emotions.","Here are thieves and robbers and tribunals: and they that are called tyrants, who deem that they have after a fashion power over us, because of the miserable body and what appertains to it. Let us show them that they have power over none.","When a man is proud because he can understand and explain thewritings of Chrysippus, say to yourself, if Chrysippus had not writtenobscurely, this man would have had nothing to be proud of.","Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy.","As for us, we behave like a herd of deer. When they flee from the huntsman\'s feathers in affright, which way do they turn? What haven of safety do they make for? Why, they rush upon the nets! And thus they perish by confounding what they should fear with that wherein no danger lies. . . . Not death or pain is to be feared, but the fear of death or pain. Well said the poet therefore:\u2014  Death has no terror; only a Death of shame!","Take care not to hurt the ruling faculty of your mind. If you were to guard against this in every action, you should enter upon those actions more safely.","Remember from now on whenever something tends to make you unhappy, draw on this principle: \'This is no misfortune; but bearing with it bravely is a blessing.","So don\'t make a show of your philosophical learning to the uninitiated, show them by your actions what you have absorbed.","He who exercises wisdom, exercises the knowledge which is about God.","When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, never shun the being seen to do it, even though the world should make a wrong supposition about it; for, if you don\u2019t act right, shun the action itself; but, if you do, why are you afraid of those who censure you wrongly?","Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them.","There is a time and place for diversion and amusements, but you should never allow them to override your true purposes.","Never say about anything, I have lost it, but only I have given it back.","Don\u2019t seek that all that comes about should come about as you wish, but wish that everything that comes about should come about just as it does, and then you\u2019ll have a calm and happy life.","If you have an earnest desire towards philosophy, prepare yourself from the very first to have the multitude laugh and sneer, and say, \\"He is returned to us a philosopher all at once; \\"and \\"Whence this supercilious look?\\" Now, for your part, do not have a supercilious look indeed; but keep steadily to those things which appear best to you, as one appointed by God to this particular station. For remember that, if you are persistent, those very persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them, you will incur a double ridicule.","For where you find unrest, grief, fear, frustrated desire, failed aversion, jealousy and envy, happiness has no room for admittance. And where values are false, these passions inevitably follow.","Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but by the opinions about the things:","Restrict yourself to choice and refusal; and exercise them carefully, with discipline and detachment.","It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgements concerning them.","Nothing great comes into being all at once, for that is not the case even with a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me now, \u2018I want a fig,\u2019 I\u2019ll reply, \u2018That takes time.","To admonish is better than to reproach for admonition is mild and friendly, but reproach is harsh and insulting; and admonition corrects those who are doing wrong, but reproach only convicts them.","Reading should serve the goal of attaining peace; if it doesn\u2019t make you peaceful, what good is it?","Fortify yourself with contentment for this is an impregnable fortress.","What saith Antisthenes? Hast thou never heard?\u2014 It is a kingly thing, O Cyrus, to do well and to be evil spoken of.","Circumstances do not rise to meet our expectations. Events happen as they do. People behave as they are. Embrace what you actually get.","Asked how a man should best grieve his enemy, Epictetus replied, \\"By setting himself to live the noblest life himself.","Be happy when you find that doctrines you have learned and analysed are being tested by real events. If you\u2019ve succeeded in removing or reducing the tendency to be mean and critical, or thoughtless, or foul-mouthed, or careless, or nonchalant; if old interests no longer engage you, at least not to the same extent; then every day can be a feast day \u2013 today because you acquitted yourself well in one set of circumstances, tomorrow because of another.","Is then the fruit of a fig-tree not perfect suddenly and in one hour, and would you possess the fruit of a man\'s mind in so short a time and so easily?","Who, then, is the invincible human being? One who can be disconcerted by nothing that lies outside the sphere of choice.","What you shun enduring yourself, attempt not to impose on others. You shun slavery- beware enslaving others! If you can endure to do that, one would think you had been once upon a time a slave yourself. For vice has nothing in common with virtue, nor Freedom with slavery.","Remember that you must behave in life as at a dinner party. Is anything brought around to you? Put out your hand and take your share with moderation. Does it pass by you? Don\u2019t stop it. Is it not yet come? Don\u2019t stretch your desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you. Do this with regard to children, to a wife, to public posts, to riches, and you will eventually be a worthy partner of the feasts of the gods. And if you don\u2019t even take the things which are set before you, but are able even to reject them, then you will not only be a partner at the feasts of the gods, but also of their empire.","Above all, remember that the door stands open. Be not more fearful than children; but as they, when they weary of the game, cry, \\"I will play no more,\\" even so, when thou art in the like case, cry, \\"I will play no more\\" and depart. But if thou stayest, make no lamentation.","If you choose, you are free; if you choose, you need blame no man\u2014accuse no man. All things will be at once according to your mind and according to the Mind of God.","The gods do not exists, and even if they exist they do not trouble themselves about people, and we have nothing in common with them. The piety and devotion to the gods that the majority of people invoke is a lie devised by swindlers and con men and, if you can believe it, by legislators, to keep criminals in line by putting the fear of God into them.","Adopt new habits yourself: consolidate your principles by putting them into practice.","Tell yourself what you want to be, then act your part accordingly.","Free is the person who lives as he wishes and cannot be coerced, impeded or compelled, whose impulses cannot be thwarted, who always gets what he desires and never has to experience what he would rather avoid.","Never praise or blame people on common grounds; look to their judgements exclusively. Because that is the determining factor, which makes everyone\'s actions either good or bad.","We should realize that an opinion is not easily formed unless a person says and hears the same things every day and practises them in real life.","It is possible to learn the will of nature from the things in which we do not differ from each other. For example, when someone else\'s little slave boy breaks his cup we are ready to say, \u201cIt\'s one of those things that just happen. Certainly, then, when your own cup is broken you should be just the way you were when the other person\'s was broken. Transfer the same idea to larger matters. Someone else\'s child is dead, or his wife. There is no one would not say, \u201cIt\'s the lot of a human being.\u201d But when one\'s own dies, immediately it is, \u201cAlas! Poor me!\u201d But we should have remembered how we feel when we hear of the same thing about others.\u201d","If you pin your hopes on things outside your control, taking upon yourself things which rightfully belong to others, you are liable to stumble, fall, suffer, and blame both gods and men. But if you focus your attention only on what is truly your own concern, and leave to others what concerns them, then you will be in charge of your interior life. No one will be able to harm or hinder you. You will blame no one, and have no enemies.","Isn\u2019t reading a kind of preparation for life?\u2019 But life is composed of things other than books. It is as if an athlete, on entering the stadium, were to complain that he\u2019s not outside exercising.This was the goal of your exercise, of your weights, your practice ring and your training partners.","If you have assumed a character beyond your strength, you have both played a poor figure in that, and neglected one that is within your powers.","Let your will to avoid have no concern with what is not in man\'s power; direct it only to things in man\'s power that are contrary to nature.","Friend, lay hold with a desperate grasp, ere it is too late, on Freedom, on Tranquility, on Greatness of soul!","The knowledge of what is mine and what is not mine, what I can and cannot do. I must die. But must I die bawling? I must be exiled; but is there anything to keep me from going with a smile, calm and self-composed?","If you wish it, you are free; if you wish it, you\u2019ll find fault with no one, you\u2019ll cast blame on no one, and everything that comes about will do so in accordance with your own will and that of God.","For what else is tragedy than the portrayal in tragic verse of the sufferings of men who have attached high value to external things? [27]","Protect what belongs to you at all costs; don\'t desire what belongs to another.","For I am not Eternity, but a human being\u2014a part of the whole, as an hour is part of the day. I must come like the hour, and like the hour must pass!","Control thy passions lest they take vengeance on thee.","He who is discontented with what he has, and with what has been granted to him by fortune, is one who is ignorant of the art of living, but he who bears that in a noble spirit, and makes reasonable use of all that comes from it, deserves to be regarded as a good man.","I must die; so must I die groaning too?","28. If a person gave your body to any stranger he met on his way, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in handing over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens to verbally attack you?","Those proficient praise no one, blame no one, and accuse no one. They say nothing concerning their self as being anybody or knowing anything.","You will never have to experience defeat if you avoid contests whose outcome is outside your control.","Disease is an impediment to the body, but not to the will, unless the will itself chooses. Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the will. And add this reflection on the occasion of everything that happens; for you will find it an impediment to something else, but not to yourself.","It is always our choice whether or not we wish to pay the price for life\'s rewards. And often it is best for us not to pay the price, for the price might be our integrity.","Never say of anything that I\'ve lost it, only that I\'ve given it back.","The wise person knows it is fruitless to project hopes and fears on the future. This only leads to forming melodramatic representations in your mind and wasting time.","CIRCUMSTANCES DON\u2019T MAKE THE MAN, THEY ONLY REVEAL HIM TO HIMSELF","What is death? A \\"tragic mask.\\" Turn it and examine it. See, it does not bite. The poor body must be separated from the spirit either now or later, as it was separated from it before. Why, then, are you troubled, if it be separated now? for if it is not separated now, it will be separated afterward. Why? That the period of the universe may be completed, for it has need of the present, and of the future, and of the past. What is pain? A mask. Turn it and examine it. The poor flesh is moved roughly, then, on the contrary, smoothly. If this does not satisfy you, the door is open: if it does, bear. For the door ought to be open for all occasions; and so we have no trouble.","You journey to Olympia to see the work of Phidias; and each of you holds it a misfortune not to have beheld these things before you die. Whereas when there is no need even to take a journey, but you are on the spot, with the works before you, have you no care to contemplate and study these?  Will you not then perceive either who you are or unto what end you were born: or for what purpose the power of contemplation has been bestowed on you?  \\"Well, but in life there are some things disagreeable and hard to bear.\\"  And are there none at Olympia? Are you not scorched by the heat? Are you not cramped for room? Have you not to bathe with discomfort? Are you not drenched when it rains? Have you not to endure the clamor and shouting and such annoyances as these? Well, I suppose you set all this over against the splendour of the spectacle and bear it patiently. What then? have you not received greatness of heart, received courage, received fortitude? What care I, if I am great of heart, for aught that can come to pass? What shall cast me down or disturb me? What shall seem painful? Shall I not use the power to the end for which I received it, instead of moaning and wailing over what comes to pass?","That Socrates should ever have been so treated by the Athenians!\\" Slave! why say \\"Socrates\\"? Speak of the thing as it is: That ever then the poor body of Socrates should have been dragged away and haled by main force to prision! That ever hemlock should have been given to the body of Socrates; that that should have breathed its life away!\u2014Do you marvel at this? Do you hold this unjust? Is it for this that you accuse God? Had Socrates no compensation for this? Where then for him was the ideal Good? Whom shall we hearken to, you or him? And what says he?  \\"Anytus and Melitus may put me to death: to injure me is beyond their power.\\"  And again:\u2014  \\"If such be the will of God, so let it be.","But to be hanged\u2014is that not unendurable?\\" Even so, when a man feels that it is reasonable, he goes off and hangs himself.","For in this Case, we are not to give Credit to the Many, who say, that none ought to be educated but the Free; but rather to the Philosophers, who say, that the Well-educated alone are free.","Epictetus has had a long-standing resonance in the United States; his uncompromising moral rigour chimed in well with Protestant Christian beliefs and the ethical individualism that has been a persistent vein in American culture. His admirers ranged from John Harvard and Thomas Jefferson in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau in the nineteenth. More recently, Vice-Admiral James Stockdale wrote movingly of how his study of Epictetus at Stanford University enabled him to survive the psychological pressure of prolonged torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam between 1965 and 1973. Stockdale\u2019s story formed the basis for a light-hearted treatment of the moral power of Stoicism in Tom Wolfe\u2019s novel A Man in Full (1998).52","Finally, when he crowns it off by becoming a senator, then he becomes a slave in fine company, then he experiences the poshest and most prestigious form of enslavement.","When then any man assents to that which is false, be assured that he did not intend to assent to it as false, for every soul is unwillingly deprived of the truth, as Plato says; but the falsity seemed to him to be true.","Don\'t concern yourself with other people\'s business. It\'s his problem if he receives you badly. And you cannot suffer for another person\'s fault. So don\'t worry about the behavior of other.","So if you like doing something, do it regularly; if you don\'t like doing something, make a habit of doing something different.","In literature, too, it is not great achievement to memorize what you have read while not formulating an opinion of your own.","Why are you pestering me, pal? My own evils are enough for me.","The soul is like the bowl of water, with the soul\'s impressions like the rays of light that strike the water. Now, if the water is disturbed, the light appears to be disturbed together with it \u2014 though of course it is not. So when someone loses consciousness, it is not the person\'s knowledge and virtues that are impaired, it is the breath that contains them. Once the breath returns to normal, knowledge and the virtues are restored to normal also.","Stop honouring externals, quit turning yourself into the tool of mere matter, or of people who can supply you or deny you those material things.","Demand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.","Disease is an impediment to the body, but not to the will, unless the will itself chooses. Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the will. And add this reflection on the occasion of everything that happens; for you will find it an impediment to something else, but not to yourself. X","Death is not dreadful or else it would have appeared dreadful to Socrates.","For if we had any sense, what else should we do, both in public and in private, than sing hymns and praise the deity, and recount all the favours that he has conferred!","Conduct yourself in all matters, grand and public or small and domestic, in accordance with the laws of nature. Harmonizing your will with nature should be your utmost ideal.","What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgements about these things.","When you are feeling upset, angry, or sad,\xa0Epictetus said,\xa0\u201cdon\u2019t blame another for your state of mind. Your condition is the result of your own opinions and interpretations. . . .\u201d","Never call yourself a philosopher, nor talk a great deal among the unlearned about theorems, but act conformably to them. Thus, at an entertainment, don\u2019t talk how persons ought to eat, but eat as you ought. For remember that in this manner Socrates also universally avoided all ostentation. And when persons came to him and desired to be recommended by him to philosophers, he took and recommended them, so well did he bear being overlooked. So that if ever any talk should happen among the unlearned concerning philosophic theorems, be you, for the most part, silent. For there is great danger in immediately throwing out what you have not digested. And, if anyone tells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have begun your business. For sheep don\u2019t throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you likewise not show theorems to the unlearned, but the actions produced by them after they have been digested.","And the way to be free is to let go of anything that is not within your control.","It isn\'t death, pain, exile or anything else you care to mention that accounts for the way we act, only our opinion about death, pain and the rest.","Nothing important comes into being overnight; even grapes and figs need time to ripen. If you say that you want a fig now, I will tell you to be patient. First, you must allow the tree to flower, then put forth fruit; then you have to wait until the fruit is ripe. So if the fruit of a fig tree is not brought to maturity instantly or in an hour, how do you expect the human mind to come to fruition, so quickly and easily?","That is the way things are weighed and disagreements settled \u2014 when standards are established. Philosophy aims to test and set such standards. And the wise man is advised to make use of their findings right way.","It is the act of an ill-instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition; it is the act of one who has begun to be instructed, to lay blame on himself; and of one whose instruction is completed, neither to blame another, nor himself.","He wants what he cannot have, and does not want what he can\'t refuse \u2014 and isn\'t aware of it. He doesn\'t know the difference between his own possessions and others\'. Because, if he did, he would never be thwarted of disappointed.Or nervous.","We aren\'t filled with fear except by things that are bad; and not by them, either, as long as it is in our power to avoid them.","I want to die, even though I don\'t have to.","You\'d have a better chance persuading someone to change their sexual orientation than reaching people who have rendered themselves so deaf and blind.","People are ready to acknowledge some of their faults, but will admit to others only with reluctance.","Does anyone bathe hastily? Do not say that they do it ill, but hastily. Does anyone drink much wine? Do not say that they do ill, but that they drink a great deal. For unless you perfectly understand their motives, how should you know if they act ill? Thus you will not risk yielding to any appearances except those you fully comprehend.","Faced with pain, you will discover the power of endurance. If you are insulted, you will discover patience. In time, you will grow to be confident that there is not a single impression that you will not have the moral means to tolerate.","Don\u2019t explain your philosophy. Embody it.","I have learned to see that whatever comes about is nothing to me if it lies beyond the sphere of choice.","In short, we do not abandon any discipline for despair of ever being the best in it.","Les feuilles tombent, la figue s\xe8che, remplace la figue fra\xeeche, le raisin sec la grappe m\xfbre, voil\xe0 selon toi des paroles de mauvaise augure ! Mais il n\u2019y a l\xe0 que la transformation d\u2019\xe9tats ant\xe9rieurs en d\u2019autres ; il n\u2019y a pas de destruction, mais un am\xe9nagement et une disposition bien r\xe9gl\xe9e. L\u2019\xe9migration n\u2019est qu\u2019un petit changement. La mort en est un plus grand, mais il ne va pas de l\u2019\xeatre actuel au non-\xeatre, mais au non-\xeatre de l\u2019\xeatre actuel. Alors ne serais-je plus ? Tu ne seras pas ce que tu es mais autre chose dont le monde aura alors besoin.","Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain or pleasure, glory or disgrace, be set before you, remember that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off; and that by one failure and defeat honor may be lost or\u2014won.","Remember then that if you think the things which are by nature slavish to be free, and the things which are in the power of others to be your own, you will be hindered, you will lament, you will be disturbed, you will blame both gods and men: but if you think that only which is your own to be your own, and if you think that what is another\'s, as it really is, belongs to another, no man will ever compel you, no man will hinder you, you will never blame any man, you will accuse no man, you will do nothing involuntarily (against your will), no man will harm you, you will have no enemy, for you will not suffer any harm. If","Who are these people whose admiration you seek? Aren\u2019t they the ones you are used to describing as mad? Well, then, is that what you want \u2013 to be admired by lunatics?","If you are told that such an one speaks ill of you, make no defense against what was said, but answer, \\"He surely knows not my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these only!","Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them.","What, for instance, does it mean to be insulted? [29] Stand by a rock and insult it, and what have you accomplished? If someone responds to insult like a rock, what has the abuser gained with his invective? If, however, he has his victim\u2019s weakness to exploit, then his efforts are worth his while.","And what else can I do, lame old man that I am, than sing the praise of God? If I were a nightingale, I would perform the work of a nightingale, and if I were a swan, that of a swan. But as it is, I am a rational being, and I must sing the praise of God.This is my work, and I accomplish it, and I will never abandon my post for as long as it is granted to me to remain in it; and I invite all of you to join me in this same song.","If what philosophers say of the kinship of God and Man be true, what remains for men to do but as Socrates did:\u2014never, when asked one\'s country, to answer, \\"I am an Athenian or a Corinthian,\\" but \\"I am a citizen of the world.","who is your master?

If someone endeavours to turn his mind towards these things, and to persuade himself to accept of his own free will what must necessarily come about, he will live a very balanced and harmonious life.","Most people are impulsive, however, and having committed to the thing, they persist, just making more confusion for themselves and others until it all end in mutual recrimination.","Supprime donc en toi toute aversion pour ce qui ne d\xe9pend pas de nous et, cette aversion, reporte-la sur ce qui d\xe9pend de nous et n\u2019est pas en accord avec la nature.

Nay, fellow man, make this your object, \'Look how I fail not to get what I will. Look how I escape what I will to avoid. Let death come and you shall know; bring me pains, prison, dishonour, condemnation.\' This is the true field of display for a young man come from school. Leave those other trifles to other men; let no one ever hear you say a word on them, do not tolerate any compliments upon them; assume the air of being no one and of knowing nothing. Show that you know this only, how not to fail and how not to fall.","When you find your direction, check to make sure that it is the right one.","People find particular things, however, frightening; and it\'s when someone is able to threaten or entice us with those that the man himself becomes frightening.","Aye, but to debase myself thus were unworthy of me.\\" \\"That,\\" said Epictetus, \\"is for you to consider, not for me. You know yourself what you are worth in your own eyes; and at what price you will sell yourself. For men sell themselves at various prices. This was why, when Florus was deliberating whether he should appear at Nero\'s shows, taking part in the performance himself, Agrippinus replied, \'But why do not you appear?\' he answered, \'Because I do not even consider the question.\' For the man who has once stooped to consider such questions, and to reckon up the value of external things, is not far from forgetting what manner of man he is. Why, what is it that you ask me? Is death preferable, or life? I reply, Life. Pain or pleasure? I reply, Pleasure.\\" \\"Well, but if I do not act, I shall lose my head.\\" \\"Then go and act! But for my part I will not act.\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"Because you think yourself but one among the many threads which make up the texture of the doublet. You should aim at being like men in general\u2014just as your thread has no ambition either to be anything distinguished compared with the other threads. But I desire to be the purple\u2014that small and shining part which makes the rest seem fair and beautiful. Why then do you bid me become even as the multitude? Then were I no longer the purple.","Is you naturally entitled, then, to a good father? No, only to a father.

Most of us are afraid of mortification of the body, and would contrive all means to avoid such a thing, but we care not about the soul\'s mortification. And indeed with regard to the soul, if a man be in such a state as not to apprehend anything, or understand at all, we think that he is in a bad condition; but if the sense of shame and modesty are deadened, this we call even power (or strength).","If you decide to do something, don\'t shrink from being seen doing it, even if the majority of people disapprove. If you\'re wrong to do it, then you should shrink from doing it altogether; but if you\'re right, then why worry how people will judge you?","you are a little soul carrying around a corpse.","Every circumstance comes with two handles, which one of which you can hold it, while with the other conditions are insupportable.","Why are we not angry if we are told that we have a headache, and why are we angry if we are told that we reason badly, or choose wrongly?\\" The reason is that we are quite certain that we have not a headache, or are not lame, but we are not so sure that we make a true choice. So having assurance only because we see with our whole sight, it puts us into suspense and surprise when another with his whole sight sees the opposite, and still more so when a thousand others deride our choice. For we must prefer our own lights to those of so many others, and that is bold and difficult.","Whatever your mission, stick by it as if it were a law and you would be committing sacrilege to betray it. Pay no attention to whatever people might say; this no longer should influence you.","Remember that in life you ought to behave as at a banquet. Suppose that something is carried round and is opposite to you. Stretch out your hand and take a portion with decency. Suppose that it passes by you. Do not detain it. Suppose that it is not yet come to you. Do not send your desire forward to it, but wait till it is opposite to you.","Happiness and freedom begin with a clear understanding of one principle: Some things are within our control, and some things are not.

[33] \u2018But how can I do it?\u2019 You\u2019ve often heard how \u2013 you need to suspend desire completely, and train aversion only on things within your power. You should dissociate yourself from everything outside yourself \u2013 the body, possessions, reputation, books, applause, as well as office or lack of office. Because a preference for any of them immediately makes you a slave, a subordinate, and prone to disappointment.","I cannot call somebody \u2018hard-working\u2019 knowing only that they read and write.

Arrogant opinion expects that there is nothing further needed, and mistrust assumes that under the torrent of circumstance there can be no happiness.","Understand what words you use first, then use them.","You are a little soul carrying a dead body, as Epictetus said.","[23] Our situation is like that at a festival.* Sheep and cattle are driven to it to be sold, and most people come either to buy or to sell, while only a few come to look at the spectacle of the festival, to see how it is proceeding and why, and who is organizing it, and for what purpose. [24] So also in this festival of the world. Some people are like sheep and cattle and are interested in nothing but their fodder; for in the case of those of you who are interested in nothing but your property, and land, and slaves, and public posts, all of that is nothing more than fodder. [25] Few indeed are those who attend the fair for love of the spectacle, asking, \u2018What is the universe, then, and who governs it? No one at all? [26] And yet when a city or household cannot survive for even a very short time without someone to govern it and watch over it, how could it be that such a vast and beautiful structure could be kept so well ordered by mere chance and good luck? [27] So there must be someone governing it. What sort of being is he, and how does he govern it? And we who have been created by him, who are we, and what were we created for? Are we bound together with him in some kind of union and interrelationship, or is that not the case?\u2019 [28] Such are the thoughts that are aroused in this small collection of people; and from then on, they devote their leisure to this one thing alone, to finding out about the festival before they have to take their leave. [29] What comes about, then? They become an object of mockery for the crowd, just as the spectators at an ordinary festival are mocked by the traders; and even the sheep and cattle, if they had sufficient intelligence, would laugh at those who attach value to anything other than fodder!","Prefer enduring satisfaction to immediate gratification.","Follow your principles as though they were laws. Do not worry if others criticize or laugh at you, for their opinions are not your concern.","Lucky is the man who dies at work.","Remember to act always as if you were at a symposium.

And if it has not reached you yet, don\'t let your desire run ahead of you, be patient until your turn comes.","If someone in the street were entrusted with your body, you would be furious. Yet you entrust your mind to anyone around who happens to insult you, and allow it to be troubled and confused. Aren\u2019t you ashamed of that?","Check your passions that you may not be punished by them.","You\'re not yet Socrates, but you can still live as if you want to be him.","you\u2019re unable to make someone change his views, recognize that he is a child, and clap as he does. Or if you don\u2019t care to act in such a way, you have only to keep quiet.","First to those universal principles I have spoken of: these you must keep at command, and without them neither sleep nor rise, drink nor eat nor deal with men: the principle that no one can control another\'s will, and that the will alone is the sphere of good and evil.","None of these things are foretold to me; but either to my paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But to me all omens are lucky, if I will. For whichever of these things happens, it is in my control to derive advantage from it.","If you win the adoration of others by pretending to be someone you\u2019re not, you may gain celebrity or high office\u2014but you will lose out on the fulfillment of a life best-suited to your attributes and abilities.","It is one thing to put bread and wine away in a store-room, and quite another to eat them. What is eaten is digested and distributed around the body, to become sinews, flesh, bones, blood, a good complexion, sound breathing. What is stored away is ready at hand, to be sure, to be taken out and displayed whenever you wish, but you derive no benefit from it, except that of having the reputation of possessing it. [","We must consider what is the time for singing, what the time for play, and in whose presence: what will be unsuited to the occasion; whether our companions are to despise us, or we to despise ourselves: when to jest, and whom to mock at: and on what occasion to be conciliatory and to whom: in a word, how one ought to maintain one\'s character in society. Wherever you swerve from any of these principles, you suffer loss at once; not loss from without, but issuing from the very act itself.","He did not say, \'Define me envy\', and then, when the man defined it, \'You define it ill, for the terms of the definition do not correspond to the subject defined.\' Such phrases are technical and therefore tiresome to the lay mind, and hard to follow, yet you and I cannot get away from them. We are quite unable to rouse the ordinary man\'s attention in a way which will enable him to follow his own impressions and so arrive at admitting or rejecting this or that. And therefore those of us who are at all cautious naturally give the subject up, when we become aware of this incapacity; while the mass of men, who venture at random into this sort of enterprise, muddle others and get muddled themselves, and end by abusing their opponents and getting abused in return, and so leave the field. But the first quality of all in Socrates, and the most characteristic, was that he never lost his temper in argument, never uttered anything abusive, never anything insolent, but bore with abuse from others and quieted strife.","The husbandman deals with land; physicians and trainers with the body; the wise man with his own Mind.","Whoever then would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others; else he must necessarily be a slave.","Never say of anything that I\'ve lost it, only that Ive given it back.","Who is a friend?\\" his answer was, \\"A second self (alter ego).","Tis true I know what evil I shall do but passion overpowers the better council.","If you are told that someone is talking badly of you, don\u2019t defend yourself against the story but reply: \u201cObviously he didn\u2019t know my other faults, or he would have mentioned them as well.","For sheep don\u2019t throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you likewise not show theorems to the unlearned, but the actions produced by them after they have been digested. 47.","End the habit of despising things that are not within your power, and apply your aversion to things that are within your power.","Asked, Who is the rich man? Epictetus replied, \\"He who is content.","Is this all the habit you acquired when you studied philosophy, to look to others and to hope for nothing from yourself and your own acts? Lament therefore and mourn, and when you eat be fearful that you will have nothing to eat to-morrow. Tremble for your wretched slaves, lest they should steal, or run away, or die. Live in this spirit, and never cease to live so, you who never came near philosophy, except in name, and disgraced its principles so far as in you lies, by showing them to be useless and unprofitable to those who take them up.","When, therefore, you see anyone eminent in honors, or power, or in high esteem on any other account, take heed not to be hurried away with the appearance, and to pronounce him happy; for, if the essence of good consists in things in our own control, there will be no room for envy or emulation.

Instead we would be satisfied to act accordingly. And rather than reckon, as we are used to doing, \u2018How many lines I read, or wrote, today,\u2019 we would pass in review how \u2018I applied impulse today the way the philosophers recommend","Yes, but my nose is running.\u2019 Then what do you have hands for, you slave?","You would fain be victor at the Olympic Games, you say. Yes, but weigh the conditions, weigh the consequences; then and then only, lay to your hand-if it be for your profit.

In a word, you must surrender yourself wholly to your trainer, as though to a physician.","of all things, the greatest, and most important, and most all-embracing, is this society in which human beings and God are associated together. From this are derived the generative forces to which not only my father and grandfather owe their origin, but also all beings that are born and grow on the earth, and especially rational beings, [5] since they alone are fitted by nature to enter into communion with the divine, being bound to God through reason.","REST.\u2014If a man should be able to assent to this doctrine as he ought, that we are all sprung from God in an especial manner, and that God is the father both of men and of gods, I suppose that he would never have any ignoble or mean thoughts about himself. But if C\xe6sar (the emperor) should adopt you, no one could endure your arrogance; and if you know that you are the son of Zeus, will you not be elated?","for your part, do not desire to be a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free; and the only way to this is a disregard of things which lie not within our own power.","Consider when, on a voyage, your ship is anchored; if you go on shore to get water you may along the way amuse yourself with picking up a shellish, or an onion. However, your thoughts and continual attention ought to be bent towards the ship, waiting for the captain to call on board; you must then immediately leave all these things, otherwise you will be thrown into the ship, bound neck and feet like a sheep. So it is with life. If, instead of an onion or a shellfish, you are given a wife or child, that is fine. But if the captain calls, you must run to the ship, leaving them, and regarding none of them. But if you are old, never go far from the ship: lest, when you are called, you should be unable to come in time.","But first consider how much more sparing and patient of hardship the poor are than we.","Is it not the same distance to God everywhere?","People feel disturbed not by things, but by the views they take of them.","If I show you, that you lack just what is most important and necessary to happiness, that hitherto your attention has been bestowed on everything rather than that which claims it most; and, to crown all, that you know neither what God nor Man is\u2014neither what Good or Evil is: why, that you are ignorant of everything else, perhaps you may bear to be told; but to hear that you know nothing of yourself, how could you submit to that? How could you stand your ground and suffer that to be proved? Clearly not at all. You instantly turn away in wrath. Yet what harm have I done to you?

What you give to the body, you presently lose; what you give to the soul, you keep for ever.","If then all things that grow, nay, our own bodies, are thus bound up with the whole, is not this still truer of our souls? And if our souls are bound up and in contact with God, as being very parts and fragments plucked from Himself, shall He not feel every movement of theirs as though it were His own, and belonging to His own nature?","we should put our trust not in the crowd, who say that only free men can be educated, but rather in the philosophers, who say that none but the educated can be free.","greatness of reason is measured not by height or length, but by the quality of its judgements.","Wherefore it is a shame for man to begin and to leave off where the brutes do.

Would it not be a desirable thing if men could be lulled and enchanted by the Stoics, and sleep and present themselves to you and to those like you to be shorn and milked?For this you ought to say to your brother Epicureans: but ought you not to conceal it from others, and particularly before every thing to persuade them, that we are by nature adapted for fellowship, that temperance is a good thing; in order that all things may be secured for you?Or ought we to maintain this fellowship with some and not with others? With whom then ought we to maintain it?With such as on their part also maintain it, or with such as violate this fellowship?And who violate it more than you who establish such doctrines?What then was it that waked Epicurus from his sleepiness, and compelled him to write what he did write?","Be careful to leave your sons [and daughters] well instructed rather than rich, for the hopes of the instructed are better than the wealth of the ignorant.\\" [in brackets: though I have only sons, I am--of course--someone\'s daughter]","Maak er van meet af aan een goede gewoonte van tegen elke pijnlijke indruk van buitenaf te zeggen: \'Jij bent niet meer dan een indruk!

Not even Zeus; nor would he wish to, but rather he has placed all of that in my own power, even as he had it himself, free from hindrance, compulsion, and restraint.","No te dejes apartar de tu deber por cualquier reflexi\xf3n vana que de ti pueda hacer el mundo necio, porque en tu poder no est\xe1n sus censuras, y, por consiguiente, no deben importarte nada","Bring on whatever difficulties you like, Zeus; I have resources and a constitution that you gave me by means of which I can do myself credit whatever happens.","[14] It is in accordance with this plan of action above all that one should train oneself. As soon as you leave the house at break of day, examine everyone whom you see, everyone whom you hear, and answer as if under questioning. What did you see? A handsome man or beautiful woman? Apply the rule. Does this lie within the sphere of choice, or outside it? Outside. Throw it away. [15] What did you see? Someone grieving over the death of his child? Apply the rule. Death is something that lies outside the sphere of choice. Away with it. You met a consul? Apply the rule. What kind of thing is a consulship? One that lies outside the sphere of choice, or inside? Outside. Throw that away too, it doesn\u2019t stand the test. Away with it; it is nothing to you. [16] If we acted in such a way and practised this exercise from morning until night, we would then have achieved something, by the gods. [17] But as things are, we\u2019re caught gazing open-mouthed at every impression that comes along, and it is only in the schoolroom that we wake up a little, if indeed we ever do. Afterwards, when we go outside, if we see someone in distress, we say, \u2018He\u2019s done for,\u2019 or if we see a consul, exclaim, \u2018A most fortunate man\u2019; if an exile, \u2018Poor wretch!\u2019; if someone in poverty, \u2018How terrible for him; he hasn\u2019t money enough to buy a meal.\u2019 [18] These vicious judgements must be rooted out, then; that is what we should concentrate our efforts on. For what is weeping and groaning? A judgement. What is misfortune? A judgement. What is civil strife, dissension, fault-finding, accusation, impiety, foolishness? [19] All of these are judgements and nothing more, and judgements that are passed, moreover, about things that lie outside the sphere of choice, under the supposition that such things are good or bad. Let someone transfer these judgements to things that lie within the sphere of choice, and I guarantee that he\u2019ll preserve his peace of mind, regardless of what his circumstances may be. [20] The mind is rather like a bowl filled with water, and impressions are like a ray of light that falls on that water. [21] When the water is disturbed, the ray of light gives the appearance of being disturbed, but that isn\u2019t really the case. [22] So accordingly, whenever someone suffers an attack of vertigo, it isn\u2019t the arts and virtues that are thrown into confusion, but the spirit in which they\u2019re contained; and when the spirit comes to rest again, so will they too.","Small-minded people habitually reproach others for their own misfortunes. Average people reproach themselves. Those who are dedicated to a life of wisdom understand that the impulse to blame something or someone is foolishness, that there is nothing to be gained in blaming, whether it be others or oneself.","Now I am being called upon for some purpose. I answer the call determined to observe the right limits; to act with restraint, but also with confidence, devoid of desire or aversion towards externals.","Care for your body as needed, but put your main energies and efforts into cultivating your mind.","It is not reasonings that are wanted now,\' he says, \'for there are books stuffed full of stoical reasonings. What is wanted, then? The man who shall apply them; whose actions may bear testimony to his doctrines. Assume this character for me, that we may no longer make use in the schools of the examples of the ancients, but may have some examples of our own.","In short, if we observe, we shall find that the animal man is pained by nothing so much as by that which is irrational; and, on the contrary, attracted to nothing so much as to that which is rational.","There are things that are within our power, and things that fall outside our power. Within our power are our own opinions, aims, desires, dislikes\u2014in sum, our own thoughts and actions. Outside our power are our physical characteristics, the class into which we were born, our reputation in the eyes of others, and honors and offices that may be bestowed on us.\xa0 Working within our sphere of control, we are naturally free, independent, and strong. Beyond that sphere, we are weak, limited, and dependent. If you pin your hopes on things outside your control, taking upon yourself things which rightfully belong to others, you are liable to stumble, fall, suffer, and blame both gods and men. But if you focus your attention only on what is truly your own concern, and leave to others what concerns them, then you will be in charge of your interior life. No one will be able to harm or hinder you. You will blame no one, and have no enemies.\xa0 If you wish to have peace and contentment, release your attachment to all things outside your control. This is the path of freedom and happiness. If you want not just peace and contentment, but power and wealth too, you may forfeit the former in seeking the latter, and will lose your freedom and happiness along the way.","I am prepared to show you that you have resources and a character naturally strong and resilient; show me in return what grounds you have for being peevish and malcontent.","Epictetus is not superior to Socrates; but if he is not inferior, this is enough for me; for I shall never be a Milo, and yet I do not neglect my body; nor shall I be a Croesus, and yet I do not neglect my property; nor, in a word, do we neglect looking after anything because we despair of reaching the highest degree.","I hope death overtakes me when I\u2019m occupied solely with the care of my character, in an effort to make it passionless, free, unrestricted and unrestrained.","Because I have no natural gifts, shall I on that account give up my discipline? Far be it from me! Epictetus will not be better than Socrates, but if only I am not worse, that suffices me. For I shall not be a Milo, either, and yet I do not neglect my body, nor a Croesus, and yet I do not neglect my property, nor, in a word, is there any other field in which we give up the appropriate discipline merely from despair of attaining the highest.","reconciliation. Remember that you are friends, you\u2019ve known each for other a long time, and the relationship is worth keeping.","For it is always true that to whatever point the perfecting of anything leads us, progress is an approach towards this point.","It is not reasonings that are wanted now for there are books stuffed full of stoical reasonings. What is wanted, then? The man who shall apply them; whose actions may bear testimony to his doctrines. Assume this character for me, that we may no longer make use in the schools of the examples of the ancients, but may have some examples of our own.","A person\u2019s worth, after all, is not found in possessions or style.","If someone, says Epictetus, refuses to accept what is patently obvious, it is not easy to find arguments to use against him that could cause him to change his mind.","There is one road to peace and happiness (keep the thought near by morning, noon and night): renunciation of externals;","But if with trembling and lamentation you seek not to fall into that which you avoid, tell me how you are improving.","When you are alone, you should call this tranquility and freedom and when you are with many you shouldn\u2019t call this a crowd, or trouble or uneasiness but festival and company and contentedly accept it.","A fool cannot be convinced or even compelled to renounce his folly.","But I want power and renown so that I may help other people, you say. What do you mean by \u201chelp\u201d? Can you really give them happiness and satisfaction\u2014things that are in their own spheres of power, not yours?\u201d","Voc\xea deseja vencer nos Jogos Ol\xedmpicos?

Otherwise you will begin with spirit, indeed, careless of the consequences, and when these are developed, you will shamefully desist. \u201cI would conquer at the Olympic Games. But consider what precedes and what follows, and then, if it be for your advantage, engage in the affair. You must conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from dainties; exercise your body, whether you choose it or not, at a stated hour, in heat and cold; you must drink no cold water, and sometimes no wine\u2014in a word, you must give yourself up to your trainer as to a physician. Then, in the combat, you may be thrown into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, swallow an abundance of dust, receive stripes [for negligence], and, after all, lose the victory. When you have reckoned up all this, if your inclination still holds, set about the combat. Otherwise, take notice, you will behave like children who sometimes play wrestlers, sometimes gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy,\xa0when they happen to have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one time a wrestler, and another a gladiator; now a philosopher, now an orator; but nothing in earnest. Like an ape you mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. For you have never entered upon anything considerately; nor after having surveyed and tested the whole matter, but carelessly, and with a halfway zeal. Thus some, when they have seen a philosopher and heard a man speaking like Euphrates[3]\u2014though, indeed, who can speak like him?\u2014have a mind to be philosophers, too. Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do you think that you can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything\u2014in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please\u2014that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar\u2019s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you\u2014that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob.\u201d","[24] In a piece of embossed silverware, what is best: the silver or the workmanship? The substance of the hand is mere flesh, but what is important is the works that the hand produces. [25] Now, appropriate actions are of three kinds:* first, those relating to mere existence, secondly, those relating to existence of a particular kind, and thirdly, those that are themselves principal duties. And what are those? [26] Fulfilling one\u2019s role as a citizen, marrying, having children, honouring God, taking care of one\u2019s parents, and, in a word, having our desires and aversions, and our motives to act and or not to act, as each of them ought to be, in accordance with our nature. And what is our nature? [27] To be people who are free, noble-minded, and self-respecting. For what other animal blushes; what other animal has a sense of shame? [28] Pleasure should be subordinated to these duties as a servant, as an attendant,* so as to arouse our zeal, so as to ensure that we consistently act in accord with nature.","No, it is events that give rise to fear -- when another has the power over them or can prevent them, that person becomes able to inspire fear. How is the fortress destroyed? Not by iron or fire, but by judgments... here is where we must begin, and it is from this front that we must seize the fortress and throw out tyrants.","Take the example of a public speaker. He is confident that he has written a good speech, he has committed the thing to memory, and can deliver it smoothly. Still he agonizes, [6] because it\u2019s not enough for him to be competent, he also hungers for the crowd\u2019s approval.","As the sun does not wait for prayers and incantations to be induced to rise, but immediately shines and is saluted by all: so do you also not wait for clappings of hands, and shouts and praise to be induced to do good, but be a doer of good voluntarily, and you will be beloved as much as the sun.","What do we value? Externals. What do we look after? Externals. [12] So of course, we are going to experience fear and nervousness.","Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things.","The whole point of learning is to live out the teachings.","when we love, hate or fear such things, then the people who administer them are bound to become our masters.","With every accident, ask yourself what abilities you have for making a proper use of it. If you see an attractive person, you will find that self-restraint is the ability you have against your desire. If you are in pain, you will find fortitude. If you hear unpleasant language, you will find patience. And thus habituated, the appearances of things will not hurry you away along with them.","Caretake this moment. Immerse yourself in its particulars. Respond to this person, this challenge, this deed. Quit the evasions. Stop giving yourself needless trouble. It is time to really live; to fully inhabit the situation you happen to be in now. You are not some disinterested bystander. Participate. Exert yourself. Respect your partnership with providence. Ask yourself often, How may I perform this particular deed such that it would be consistent with and acceptable to the divine will? Heed the answer and get to work. When your doors are shut and your room is dark, you are not alone. The will of nature is within you as your natural genius is within. Listen to its importunings. Follow its directives. As concerns the art of living, the material is your own life. No great thing is created suddenly. There must be time. Give your best and always be kind.","Do not worry if others criticize or laugh at you, for their opinions are not your concern.","People who are ignorant of philosophy blame others for their own misfortunes. Those who are beginning to learn philosophy blame themselves. Those who have mastered philosophy blame no one.","Approach life as your own Olympic Games\u2014","When you feel burning desire for something that appears pleasureful, you are like a person under a spell. Instead of acting on impulse, take a step back\u2014wait till the enchantment fades and you can see things as they are.","So in the field of assent you cannot be hindered or obstructed. \u2018Evidently.","When we are invited to a banquet, we take what is put before us. If someone should order the host to serve him fish or pastries, he would seem eccentric. But out in the world, we ask the gods for things they do not give us\u2500even though there are many things they have given us.","Philosophy is for living, not just learning.","Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well.","Lead me, Fate, wherever you will, and I will cheerfully follow. For, even if I kick and wail, all the same I must follow. \u2014Cleanthes","Every day you should put the ideas in action that protect against attachment to externals such as individual people, places or institutions \u2013 even your own body.","But God has introduced man to be a spectator of God and of his works; and not only a spectator of them, but an interpreter. For this reason it is shameful for man to begin and to end where irrational animals do; but rather he ought to begin where they begin, and to end where nature ends in us; and nature ends in contemplation and understanding, and in a way of life conformable to nature. Take care then not to die without having been spectators of these things.","Therefore your will is your own business too.","When you are by yourself you should call it peace and liberty, and consider yourself the gods\u2019 equal. When you\u2019re with a large group you shouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re in a mob or crowd, but a guest at a feast or festival \u2013 and in that spirit learn to enjoy it.","Whoever yields to fate becomes wise, by learning the laws of heaven. \u2014Euripides","They may kill me, but they cannot hurt me. \u2014Socrates","[33] Consider at what price you sell your integrity; but please, for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t sell it cheap.","When it is time to leave the sun and moon behind, how will you react? [34] Will you sit down and cry, like an infant? Did nothing that you heard and studied in school get through to you? Why did you advertise yourself as a philosopher when you might have told the truth: \u2018I made it through a couple of primers, then read a little Chrysippus \u2013 but I hardly crossed the threshold of philosophy.\u2019 [35] How can you associate yourself with Socrates, who lived and died as he did, or with Diogenes?","if you shall seem to some to be a person of importance, distrust yourself.","They are all just so many opportunities to justify your ways to man, by showing just how little circumstances amount to.","These reasonings are unconnected: \u201cI am richer than you, therefore I am better; \u201cI am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better.\u201d The connection is rather this: \u201cI am richer than you, therefore my property is greater than yours;\u201d \u201cI am more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than yours.\u201d But you, after all, are neither property nor style.\u201d","The true basis for being respected is to appear refined and modest.","why act the part of a Jew when you\u2019re Greek?

And when we see someone hesitating between two creeds, we\u2019re accustomed to say, \u2018He is no Jew, but is merely acting the part.\u2019 But when he assumes the frame of mind of one who has been baptized * and has made his choice, then he really is a Jew, and is called by that name.","Inner peace begins when we stop saying of things, \u201cI have lost it and instead say, \u201cIt has been returned to where it came from.\u201d","Getting rid of these, too, requires looking to God for help, trusting him alone, and submitting to his direction. [47] Then if you\u2019re not willing to do this \u2013 all tears and agitation \u2013 you will serve someone physically more powerful than you, and continue to look outside yourself for happiness, fated never to find it. And that is because you look for it in the wrong place, forgetting to look where it really lies.","I see good people dying of cold and hunger.\u2019 Well, don\u2019t you see wicked people dying of luxury, pride and excess?","Take example from the wrestling-masters. Has the boy fallen down? Get up, again, they say; wrestle again until you have made yourself strong. That\u2019s the sort of attitude you should have\u2026For both ruin and salvation have their source within you.","If you didn\u2019t learn these things in order to demonstrate them in practice, what did you learn them for?","Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions. The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed. Aiming therefore at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself to be carried, even with a slight tendency, towards the attainment of lesser things. Instead, you must entirely quit some things and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would both have these great things, along with power and riches, then you will not gain even the latter, because you aim at the former too: but you will absolutely fail of the former, by which alone happiness and freedom are achieved. Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, \u201cYou are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be. And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, by this: whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not; and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.\u201d","When we are guests at a dinner party, we content ourselves with the food on offer; if anyone were to tell the host to put out fish or cake, he would seem rude. In real life, however, we ask the gods for what they do not give, and this though they have provided us with plenty.","If any one trusted your body to the first man he met, you would be indignant, but yet you trust your mind to the chance comer, and allow it to be disturbed and confounded if he revile you; are you not ashamed to do so?","These are not the circumstances that I want.\u2019 Is it up to you to choose them?

Then formulate answers as if they were posing questions.","Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, \u201cYou are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be. And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, by this: whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not; and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.\u201d","Let someone transfer these opinions to the workings of the will, and I personally guarantee his peace of mind, no matter what his outward circumstances are like.","Do not say of anything \u201cI have lost it, but rather, \u201cI have given it back.\u201d Has your wife died? You have given her back. Has your child died? You have given him back. Have you lost your home? You have given it back. \u201cBut,\u201d you may retort, \u201ca bad person took it.\u201d It is not your concern by what means something returns to the Source from which it came. For as long as the Source entrusts something to your hands, treat it as something borrowed, like a traveller at an inn.\u201d","The soul is like a bowl of water, with the soul\u2019s impressions like the rays of light that strike the water. [21] Now, if the water is disturbed, the light appears to be disturbed together with it \u2013 though of course it is not.","Is there smoke in the house? If it\u2019s not suffocating, I will stay indoors; if it proves too much, I\u2019ll leave. Always remember \u2013 the door is open.","Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it is easier to maintain control.","No greater thing is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig; if you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer you that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen.","Syytt\xe4\xe4 toisia omasta onnettomuudestansa on sivistym\xe4tt\xf6myyden merkki; syytt\xe4\xe4 itse\xe4ns\xe4 on sivistyksen alkeiden ilmaus, olla syytt\xe4m\xe4tt\xe4 muita ja itse\xe4ns\xe4 on n\xe4yte ihmisen sivistyksest\xe4.","It is for you to arrange your priorities; but whatever you decide to do, don\u2019t do it resentfully, as if you were being imposed on.","At a feast, do not give a speech about how everyone should eat. Only eat as you should. Socrates never made a spectacle of himself or put on an air of authority. In philosophical conversations, follow his example\u2014stay mostly silent; ask questions and listen intently. If anyone calls you ignorant and says you know nothing, be sure that you are now a true student of philosophy.","If you commit to philosophy, be prepared at once to be laughed at and made the butt of many snide remarks, like, \u2018Suddenly there\u2019s a philosopher among us!\u2019 and \u2018What makes him so pretentious now?\u2019 Only don\u2019t be pretentious: just stick to your principles as if God had made you accept the role of philosopher. And rest assured that, if you remain true to them, the same people who made fun of you will come to admire you in time; whereas, if you let these people dissuade you from your choice, you will earn their derision twice over.","Because when you engage in the same things as the masses, you lower yourself to their level.","Those are the reflections you should recur to morning and night. Start with things that are least valuable and most liable to be lost \u2013 things such as a jug or a glass \u2013 and proceed to apply the same ideas to clothes, pets, livestock, property; then to yourself, your body, the body\u2019s parts, your children, your siblings and your wife. [112] Look on every side and mentally discard them. Purify your thoughts, in case of an attachment or devotion to something that doesn\u2019t belong to you and will hurt to have wrenched away. [113] And as you exercise daily, as you do at the gym, do not say that you are philosophizing (admittedly a pretentious claim), but that you are a slave presenting your emancipator;14 because this is genuine freedom that you cultivate.","An ignorant person is one who is tossed about between elation and despair by external forces and events.","Kun korppi koikkuu onnettomuutta ennustaen, \xe4lk\xf6\xf6n se n\xe4ky sinua s\xe4ik\xe4ytt\xe4k\xf6, vaan heti selit\xe4 ja sano itsellesi: tuo ei aavista mit\xe4\xe4n minulle, vaan ehk\xe4 raukalle ruumiilleni tai v\xe4h\xe4p\xe4t\xf6isille varoilleni tai mukamalle maineelleni tai lapsilleni tai vaimolleni.

They overtake the farmer at the plough, the sailor at the helm; [6] what do you want to be doing when they come upon you? Because you have to be doing something when you go; and if you can find anything better than this to be doing, then do it by all means.","We can familiarize ourselves with the will of nature by calling to mind our common experiences. When a friend breaks a glass, we are quick to say, \u2018Oh, bad luck.\u2019 It\u2019s only reasonable, then, that when a glass of your own breaks, you accept it in the same patient spirit. Moving on to graver things: when somebody\u2019s wife or child dies, to a man we all routinely say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s part of life.\u2019 But if one of our own family is involved, then right away it\u2019s \u2018Poor, poor me!\u2019 We would do better to remember how we react when a similar loss afflicts others.","Did you ever see me any way but with a smile on my face, ready to obey any orders that you had for me?","Whatever is enough is abundant in the eyes of virtue.","Don\u2019t demand that things happen as you wish, but wish that they happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.","One person likes tending to his farm, another to his horse; I like to daily monitor my self-improvement.","Geef me de moed om alles te accepteren wat niet in mijn vermogen ligt, de kracht om alles te veranderen wat wel in mijn vermogen ligt, en de wijsheid om tussen die twee te onderscheiden.","Goodness exists independently of our conception of it. The good is out there and it always has been out there, even before we began to exist.","Well, then, biting, kicking, wanton imprisonment and beheading \u2013 is that what our nature entails? No; rather, acts of kindness, cooperation and good will. And so, whether you like it or not, a person fares poorly whenever he acts like an insensitive brute.","When did anger, however, ever teach someone to play music or pilot a ship?","Whenever you see someone holding political power, set against it the fact that you yourself have no need of power. Whenever you see someone wealthy, observe what you have instead of that. For if you have nothing in its place, you are in a miserable state; but if you have the absence of the need to have wealth, realize that you have something greater and much more valuable. One man has a beautiful wife, you have the absence of longing for a beautiful wife. Do you think these are little things? How much would these very people \u2013 the wealthy, the powerful, the ones who live with beautiful women \u2013 pay for the ability to look down on wealth and power and those very women whom they adore and get?","Content yourself with being a lover of wisdom, a seeker of the truth. Return and return again to what is essential and worthy. Do not try to seem wise to others. If you want to live a wise life, live it on your own terms and in your own eyes.","For as wood is the material of the carpenter, and marble that of the sculptor, so the subject matter of the art of life is the life of the self.","Show me someone untroubled with disturbing thoughts about illness, danger, death, exile or loss of reputation. By all the gods, I want to see a Stoic!","The soul stands on unassailable ground, if it has abandoned external things; it is independent in its own fortress; and every weapon that is hurled falls short of the mark. Fortune has not the long reach with which we credit her; she can seize none except him that clings to her. Let us then recoil from her as far as we are able. This will be possible for us only through knowledge of self and of the world of Nature. The soul should know whither it is going and whence it came, what is good for it and what is evil, what it seeks and what it avoids, and what is that Reason which distinguishes between the desirable and the undesirable, and thereby tames the madness of our desires and calms the violence of our fears. Some men flatter themselves that they have checked these evils by themselves even without the aid of philosophy; but when some accident catches them off their guard, a tardy confession of error is wrung from them. Their boastful words perish from their lips when the torturer commands them to stretch forth their hands, and when death draws nearer!","Consciousness of its weakness will keep you from tackling difficult subjects.","But when he comes in thunder and lightning brandishing these things, and I show fear in response, in effect I have been brought face to face with my master, just like a runaway slave.","So-and-so\u2019s son died.\u2019 (\u2018The question\u2019). Answer: \u2018Since it\u2019s nothing he can control, it isn\u2019t bad.","It is difficult circumstances that show real men.","If, however, I liberate myself from my master \u2013 which is to say, from the emotions that make my master frightening \u2013 what troubles can I have? No man is my master any longer.","Consider when, on a voyage, your ship is anchored; if you go on shore to get water you may along the way amuse yourself with picking up a shellfish, or an onion. However, your thoughts and continual attention ought to be bent towards the ship, waiting for the captain to call on board; you must then immediately leave all these things, otherwise you will be thrown into the ship, bound neck and feet like a sheep. So it is with life. If, instead of an onion or a shellfish, you are given a wife or child, that is fine.","But it\u2019s not right of Zeus to do this.\u2019 Why? Because he made you tough and proud, removed the stigma of evil from these circumstances and made it possible for you to be happy despite them? Or because he left the door open when things finally don\u2019t agree with you? Friend, take advantage of it, and stop blaming God.","Settle on the type of person you want to be and stick to it, whether alone or in company.","Let man be pleased with whatever has pleased God; let him marvel at himself and his own resources for this very reason, that he cannot be overcome, that he has the very powers of evil subject to his control, and that he brings into subjection chance and pain and wrong by means of that strongest of powers \u2013 reason. Love reason! The love of reason will arm you against the greatest hardships.","As the fire-lights in harbors by a few pieces of dry wood raises a great flame and give sufficient help to ships which are wandering on the sea; so also an illustrious man in a state which is tempest-tossed, while he is himself satisfied with a few things does great services to his citizens.","If you wish to have peace and contentment, release your attachment to all things outside your control.","Externals include the body and its members, as well as material goods. If you grow attached to any of them as if they were your own, you will incur the penalties prescribed for a thief.","It\u2019s a living soul I want one of you to show me, the soul of a person willing to work with, and never criticize, either God or a fellow human being. One who will never fail, or have experiences he does not want; who will never give in to anger, jealousy or the desire to dominate others.","If you decide to do something, don\u2019t shrink from being seen doing it, even if the majority of people disapprove. If you\u2019re wrong to do it, then you should shrink from doing it altogether; but if you\u2019re right, then why worry how people will judge you?","Nothing important comes into being overnight; even grapes or figs need time to ripen. If you say that you want a fig now, I will tell you to be patient. First, you must allow the tree to flower, then put forth fruit; then you have to wait until the fruit is ripe. [8] So if the fruit of a fig tree is not brought to maturity instantly or in an hour, how do you expect the human mind to come to fruition, so quickly and easily?","I will define him simply as someone set on becoming a god rather than a man.","These inferences are invalid: \u201cI am richer than you, therefore I am better than you, and \u201cI am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better than you.\u201d But the following inferences are more cogent: \u201cI am richer than you, therefore my property is better than yours,\u201d or \u201cI am more eloquent than you, therefore my diction is better than yours.\u201d But you yourself are neither property nor diction.\u201d","People are not disturbed by things themselves, but by the views they take of those things.","Things and people are not what we wish them to be nor what they seem to be. They are what they are.","I am richer than you, therefore my wealth is superior to yours\u2019; and \u2018I am a better speaker, therefore my diction is better than yours.\u2019 But you are neither wealth nor diction.","The fear of death stems from the view that it is fearful.","We have two ears and one mouth-so that we can listen twice as much as we speak","Whatever your mission, stick by it as if it were a law and you would be committing sacrilege to betray it.","Just begin, believe me, and you will see the truth of what I\u2019ve been saying.","No. Instead from school it\u2019s straight off to the theatre, to a gladiatorial game, to an athletic show or the circus. Then from there you come back here, and from here, off you go again, the same people, the same pursuits \u2013 [15] you show no serious discipline, concern, or care for yourself.","remain steadfast in pursuing your mission, always willing to shed distractions.","Some things are within our power while others are not.","Lead me, Zeus, lead me, Destiny, To the goal I was long ago assigned And I will follow without hesitation. Even should I resist, In a spirit of perversity, I will have to follow nonetheless. [2] Whoever yields to necessity graciously We account wise in God\u2019s ways.","Each time an obstacle arises, remind yourself of this truth. While it may hinder some part of you, it cannot constrain your true self.","These reasonings have no logical connection: \u201cI am richer than you, therefore I am your superior. \u201cI am more eloquent than you, therefore I am your superior.\u201d The true logical connection is rather this: \u201cI am richer than you, therefore my possessions must exceed yours.\u201d \u201cI am more eloquent\xa0than you, therefore my style must surpass yours.\u201d But you, after all, consist neither in property nor in style.\u201d","End the habit of despising things that are not within your power,","I cannot stay in harmony if I let myself become upset by things beyond my control.","Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things.","No man is free unless he is the master of himself.","death is nothing to fear in itself, or Socrates would have run from it.","When you are feeling upset, angry, or sad, don\u2019t blame another for your state of mind.","A vine cannot behave olively, nor an olive tree vinely \u2013 it is impossible, inconceivable.","Every difficulty in life presents us with an opportunity to turn inward and to invoke our own submerged inner resources. The trials we endure can and should introduce us to our strengths...Dig deeply. You possess strengths you might not realize you have. Find the right one. Use it.","The object of your love is mortal; it is not one of your possessions; it has been given to you for the present, not inseparably nor forever. (Epictetus, The Discourses)\u201d","What, then, is your own? The way you live your life.","If you\u2019re writing to a friend, grammar will tell you what letters you ought to choose, but as to whether or not you ought to write to your friend, grammar won\u2019t tell you that.","Whatever rules you have adopted, abide by them as laws, and as if you would be impious to transgress them; and do not regard what anyone says of you, for this, after all, is no concern of yours. How long, then, will you delay to demand of yourself the noblest improvements, and in no instance to transgress the judgments of reason? You have received the philosophic principles with which you ought to be conversant; and you have been conversant with them. For what other master, then, do you wait as an excuse for this delay in self-reformation? You are no longer a boy but a grown man. If, therefore, you will be negligent and slothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, purpose to purpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, you will insensibly continue to accomplish nothing and, living and dying, remain of vulgar mind. This instant, then, think yourself worthy of living as a man grown up and a proficient. Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain or pleasure, glory or disgrace, be set before you, remember that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off; and that by one failure and defeat honor may be lost or\u2014won. Thus Socrates became perfect, improving himself by everything, following\xa0reason alone. And though you are not yet a Socrates, you ought, however, to live as one seeking to be a Socrates.","If you hear that someone is speaking ill of you, instead of trying to defend yourself you should say: \u2018He obviously does not know me very well, since there are so many other faults he could have mentioned\u2019.","N\xe3o procures que tudo quanto acontece aconte\xe7a como desejas, antes deseja que tudo aconte\xe7a como de facto acontece. Desse modo ser\xe1s feliz.","It is better to die poor, while free from fear and grief, than to live surrounded by riches and filled with anxiety.","[13] But it sometimes comes about that, when we have properly granted certain premisses, certain conclusions are derived from them that, though false, nonetheless follow from them. [14] What am I to do, then? Accept the false conclusion? [15] And how is that possible? Then should I say that I was wrong to accept the premisses? No, this isn\u2019t permissible either. Or say: That doesn\u2019t follow from the premisses? But that again isn\u2019t permissible. [16] So what is one to do in such circumstances? Isn\u2019t it the same as with debts? Just as having borrowed on some occasion isn\u2019t enough to make somebody a debtor, but it is necessary in addition that he continues to owe the money and hasn\u2019t paid off the loan; likewise, our having accepted the premisses isn\u2019t enough to make it necessary for us to accept the inference, but we have to continue to accept the premisses. [","Whenever distress or displeasure arises in your mind, remind yourself, \u201cThis is only my interpretation, not reality itself. Then ask whether it falls within or outside your sphere of power. And, if it is beyond your power to control, let it go.\u201d","Study, not in order to add anything to your knowledge, but to make your knowledge better.","If you are praised by others, be skeptical of yourself. For it is no easy feat to hold onto your inner harmony while collecting accolades.","So in life our first job is this, to divide and distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them I do control","You should keep learning as long as you are ignorant, \u2013 even to the end of your life, if there is anything in the proverb. And the proverb suits the present case as well as any: \\"As long as you live, keep learning how to live.","When you desire something outside your sphere of power, you set yourself up for disappointment","If you have nothing better to do than praise me for it, then my speech was a failure.","endurance of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people\'s affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.","Continually remind yourself that you are a mortal being, and someday will die. This will inspire you not to waste precious time in fruitless activities, like stewing over grievances and striving after possessions.","You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own ruling faculty or externals, and apply yourself either to things within or without you; that is, be either a philosopher, or one of the vulgar.","Continually remind yourself that you are a mortal being, and someday will die.","How do I handle chance impressions, naturally or unnaturally?

Aren\u2019t you ashamed that you hand over your mind to anyone around, for it to be upset and confused if the person insults you?","Wisdom\'s seat is higher; she trains not the hands, but is mistress of our minds.","If a man, said Epictetus, opposes evident truths, it is not easy to find arguments by which we shall make him change his opinion. But this does not arise either from the man\'s strength or the teacher\'s weakness; for when the man, though he has been confuted, is hardened like a stone, how shall we then be able to deal with him by argument?","It is not wisdom that contrives arms, or walls, or instruments useful in war; nay, her voice is for peace, and she summons all mankind to concord. It is not she, I maintain, who is the artisan of our indispensable implements of daily use. Why do you assign to her such petty things? You see in her the skilled artisan of life. The other arts, it is true, wisdom has under her control; for he whom life serves is also served by the things which equip life. But wisdom\'s course is toward the state of happiness; thither she guides us, thither she opens the way for us. She shows us what things are evil and what things are seemingly evil; she strips our minds of vain illusion. She bestows upon us a greatness which is substantial, but she represses the greatness which is inflated, and showy but filled with emptiness; and she does not permit us to be ignorant of the difference between what is great and what is but swollen; nay, she delivers to us the knowledge of the whole of nature and of her own nature. She discloses to us what the gods are and of what sort they are; what are the nether gods, the household deities, and the protecting spirits; what are the souls which have been endowed with lasting life and have been admitted to the second class of divinities, where is their abode and what their activities, powers, and will.","No person is free who is not master of themselves.","The Good stands before us like an archer\u2019s target. Evil is not a thing in itself but a missing of the mark, an arrow gone astray.","It\u2019s something like going on an ocean voyage. What can I do? Pick the captain, the boat, the date, and the best time to sail. [11] But then a storm hits. Well, it\u2019s no longer my business; I have done everything I could. It\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem now \u2013 namely the captain\u2019s. [12] But then the boat actually begins to sink. What are my options? I do the only thing I am in a position to do, drown \u2013 but fearlessly, without bawling or crying out to God, because I know that what is born must also die.","For my part, I can say, \u2018bring what challenge you please and I will turn it to good account: bring illness, death, poverty, slander, a judgement of death: they will all be converted to advantage by my wand of Hermes.","Never call yourself a philosopher, nor talk a great deal among the unlearned about theorems, but act conformably to them. Thus, at an entertainment, don\u2019t talk how persons ought to eat, but eat as you ought.","Know, first, who you are; and then adorn yourself accordingly.","Do not say of anything \u201cI have lost it, but rather, \u201cI have given it back.\u201d","Working within our sphere of control, we are naturally free, independent, and strong. Beyond that sphere, we are weak, limited, and dependent.","If you act rashly, without regard to consequences, you may defeat your purposes.","Everything is estimated by the standard of its own good. The vine is valued for its productiveness and the flavour of its wine, the stag for his speed. We ask, with regard to beasts of burden, how sturdy of back they are; for their only use is to bear burdens. If a dog is to find the trail of a wild beast, keenness of scent is of first importance; if to catch his quarry, swiftness of foot; if to attack and harry it, courage. In each thing that quality should be best for which the thing is brought into being and by which it is judged. And what quality is best in man? It is reason; by virtue of reason he surpasses the animals, and is surpassed only by the gods. Perfect reason is therefore the good peculiar to man; all other qualities he shares in some degree with animals and plants. Man is strong; so is the lion. Man is comely; so is the peacock. Man is swift; so is the horse. I do not say that man is surpassed in all these qualities. I am not seeking to find that which is greatest in him, but that which is peculiarly his own. Man has body; so also have trees. Man has the power to act and to move at will; so have beasts and worms. Man has a voice; but how much louder is the voice of the dog, how much shriller that of the eagle, how much deeper that of the bull, how much sweeter and more melodious that of the nightingale! What then is peculiar to man? Reason. When this is right and has reached perfection, man\'s felicity is complete. Hence, if everything is praiseworthy and has arrived at the end intended by its nature, when it has brought its peculiar good to perfection, and if man\'s peculiar good is reason; then, if a man has brought his reason to perfection, he is praiseworthy and has readied the end suited to his nature. This perfect reason is called virtue, and is likewise that which is honourable.","It is not your concern by what means something returns to the Source from which it came.","Most of us would be seized with fear if our bodies went numb, and would do everything possible to avoid it, yet we take no interest at all in the numbing of our souls.","Do you think freedom is something good?\u2019 \u2018The greatest good of all.\u2019 \u2018Can anyone in possession of the greatest good be unhappy or unfortunate?\u2019 \u2018No.","Voc\xea deve se submeter \xe0 disciplina, comer de acordo, n\xe3o tocar em doces, treinar debaixo de rigores, numa hora fixa, no calor e no frio, n\xe3o beber \xe1gua muito gelada, nem vinho, a n\xe3o ser quando receber a ordem de fazer isso; voc\xea deve se entregar completamente ao seu treinador assim como o faria com o seu m\xe9dico e depois, quando chega a hora da competi\xe7\xe3o, voc\xea deve se arriscar a se machucar e algumas vezes ter a sua m\xe3o deslocada, torcer o tornozelo, engolir um bocado de areia, algumas vezes ser fustigado, e junto com isso tudo, ser derrotado.

You never will prove it, nor anything like it; for the law of nature and of god is this: Let the better always be superior to the worse\u2026 Thus I, too, lost my lamp to a thief because the thief was better at keeping awake than I. But he bought a lamp at the price of being a thief, a rogue, and a brute. That seemed to him a good bargain. \\tEpictetus","When you attend the games, do not get emotionally invested in the rivalry. Wish only that the best team or athlete wins. Avoid the extremes of elation at a win and devastation at a loss.","But if you try to avoid what you cannot control\u2014sickness, poverty, death\u2014you will inflict useless mental suffering upon yourself.","If you have a favorite cup, remember that it is only a cup that you prefer\u2014if it is broken, you can bear it.","What am I to do? Death is on my trail, and life is fleeting away; teach me something with which to face these troubles. Bring it to pass that I shall cease trying to escape from death, and that life may cease to escape from me. Give me courage to meet hardships; make me calm in the face of the unavoidable. Relax the straitened limits of the time which is allotted me. Show me that the good in life does not depend upon life\'s length, but upon the use we make of it; also, that it is possible, or rather usual, for a man who has lived long to have lived too little. Say to me when I lie down to sleep: \\"You may not wake again!\\" And when I have waked: \\"You may not go to sleep again!\\" Say to me when I go forth from my house: \\"You may not return!\\" And when I return: \\"You may never go forth again!\\" You are mistaken if you think that only on an ocean voyage there is a very slight space between life and death. No, the distance between is just as narrow everywhere. It is not everywhere that death shows himself so near at hand; yet everywhere he is as near at hand.","La conclusi\xf3n final de esta filosof\xeda es que el bien y el mal se relacionan exclusivamente con nuestra prohairesis, es decir: con nuestro libre albedr\xedo, por lo que no dependen de las cosas externas o circunstanciales. En otras palabras, somos nuestro propio bien y nuestro propio mal, m\xe1s all\xe1 de las circunstancias, puesto que la facultad de elegir en nuestro libre albedr\xedo.

But giving her the power to upset you does no good for either of you.","If anyone tells you that such a person speaks ill of you, don\u2019t make excuses about what is said of you, but answer: \u201c He does not know my other faults, else he would not have mentioned only these.","If anything except the honourable is good, we shall be hounded by greed for life, and by greed for the things which provide life with its furnishings, \u2013 an intolerable state, subject to no limits, unstable. The only good, therefore, is that which is honourable, that which is subject to bounds.","What\u2019s odd in asserting that what\u2019s bad for anything is what runs contrary to its nature? You say it for everything else, why make humanity the sole exception?","Muista, ett\xe4 olet n\xe4yttelij\xe4 n\xe4ytelm\xe4ss\xe4, joka on ohjaajan tahdon mukainen.

When grasping for one, you are likely to drop the other.","When you are feeling upset, angry, or sad, don\u2019t blame another for your state of mind. Your condition is the result of your own opinions and interpretations.","It\u2019s like weaving: the weaver does not make the wool, he makes the best use of whatever wool he\u2019s given.","Yes, but what good will all this do me when a child of mine dies, or if my brother, or I myself, have to die or be tortured?\u2019 [19] Nothing. Because that\u2019s not why you came, not why you took your seat in front of me, not the reason you sometimes sacrificed sleep to study by lamplight.","If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you, but answer: \u201cHe was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.","It was thus an excellent reply that the woman made when she wanted to send a boatload of provisions to the exiled Gratilla;* for when someone said to her, \u2018Domitian will merely confiscate them,\u2019 she replied, \u2018Better that he should take them away than that I should fail to send them.","And can you be forced by anyone to desire something against your will? \u2018No.","If you do not wish to be prone to anger, do not feed the habit; give it nothing which may tend its increase.","Pid\xe4 silmiesi edess\xe4 joka p\xe4iv\xe4 kuolema ja maanpako ja kaikki kauheana n\xe4ytt\xe4ytyv\xe4, ennen kaikkea kuolema.

More than this\u2014if you abstain from the rich desserts that come your way, passing them on to others, you will become worthy to rule with the gods. This was the way of Diogenes and Heraclitus, and they are now venerated as divine.","In this body, this universe, this community, it is inevitable that each of us faces some such event. [28] Your job, then, is to appear before the court, say what you have to say and make the best of the situation. [29] Then the judge declares you guilty. \u2018I wish you well, judge.

Another in the same circumstance, taking a different perspective, would react quite differently.\xa0\xa0 Do not share these thoughts with the grieving person.

Your tears will be outward, not inward.\u201d","Don\u2019t look for it in externals; it isn\u2019t in the body, and, if you doubt me, just look at Myron or Ophellius.

But to act well in your given role\u2014this is your sphere of power.","So decide now that you are worthy of living as a full-grown man who is making progress, and make everything that seems best be a law that you cannot go against. And if you meet with any hardship or anything pleasant or reputable or disreputable, then remember that the contest is now and the Olympic games are now and you cannot put things off any more and that your progress is made or destroyed by a single day and a single action","It is a universal law \u2013 have no illusions \u2013 that every creature alive is attached to nothing so much as to its own self-interest.","Nothing is foreboding to me. All signs point to good luck, if I interpret them that way. Whatever life brings, I can use it to my advantage.","Why then does he seem great to you? It is because you are measuring the pedestal along with the man. A dwarf is not tall, though he stand upon a mountain-top; a colossal statue will still be tall, though you place it in a well. This is the error under which we labour; this is the reason why we are imposed upon: we value no man at what he is, but add to the man himself the trappings in which he is clothed. But when you wish to inquire into a man\'s true worth, and to know what manner of man he is, look at him when he is naked; make him lay aside his inherited estate, his titles, and the other deceptions of fortune; let him even strip off his body. Consider his soul, its quality and its stature, and thus learn whether its greatness is borrowed, or its own.","If you make peace with all things that are beyond your power, refusing to fight them, you will be invincible.","When you\'re alone you should call this condition tranquility and freedom, and think of yourself like the gods; and when you are with many, you shouldn\'t call it a crowd, or trouble, or uneasiness, but festival and company, and contentedly accept it.","So when someone assents to a false proposition, be sure that they did not want to give their assent, since, as Plato says, \u2018Every soul is deprived of the truth against its will.\u201947 [5] They simply mistook for true something false.","Nothing is in reality either pleasant or unpleasant by nature but all things become so through habit.","Wisdom is a large and spacious thing. It needs plenty of free room. One must learn about things divine and human, the past and the future, the ephemeral and the eternal; and one must learn about Time.","Avoid Most Popular Entertainment Most of what passes for legitimate entertainment is inferior or foolish and only caters to or exploits people\u2019s weaknesses. Avoid being one of the mob who indulges in such pastimes. Your life is too short and you have important things to do. Be discriminating about what images and ideas you permit into your mind. If you yourself don\u2019t choose what thoughts and images you expose yourself to, someone else will, and their motives may not be the highest. It is the easiest thing in the world to slide imperceptibly into vulgarity. But there\u2019s no need for that to happen if you determine not to waste your time and attention on mindless pap.","But the wise man knows that all things are in store for him. Whatever happens, he says: \\"I knew it.","if you suppose any of the things not in our own control to be either good or evil, when you are disappointed of what you wish, or incur what you would avoid, you must necessarily find fault with and blame the authors. For every animal is naturally formed to fly and abhor things that appear hurtful, and the causes of them; and to pursue and admire those which appear beneficial, and the causes of them. It is impractical, then, that one who supposes himself to be hurt should be happy about the person who, he thinks, hurts him, just as it is impossible to be happy about the hurt itself. Hence,","And, if anyone tells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then you be sure that you have begun your business. For sheep don\'t throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you likewise not show theorems to the unlearned, but the actions produced by them after they have been digested.","It is not the person who insults or attacks you who torments your mind, but the view you take of these things.","The divine order does not design people or circumstance according to our tastes","Are the Trojans wise or foolish? If they are wise, do not quarrel with them; if they are fools, ignore them.","Thus, whatever phase of things human and divine you have apprehended, you will be wearied by the vast number of things to be answered and things to be learned. And in order that these manifold and mighty subjects may have free entertainment in your soul, you must remove therefrom all superfluous things. Virtue will not surrender herself to these narrow bounds of ours; a great subject needs wide space in which to move. Let all other things be driven out, and let the breast be emptied to receive virtue.","But my nose is running!\' What do you have hands for, idiot, if not to wipe it? \'But how is it right that there be running noses in the first place?\' Instead of thinking up protests, wouldn\'t it be easier just to wipe your nose?","For your part, do not adopt any air of superiority. Mind your own business, keep busy with the work you are best suited for, and play well the part the Author has given you.","In every situation, consider what precedes it and what may follow\u2014then act. If you act rashly, without regard to consequences, you may defeat your purposes.","35. When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, never shun the being seen to do it, even though the world should make a wrong supposition about it; for, if you don\u2019t act right, shun the action itself; but, if you do, why are you afraid of those who censure you wrongly?","The upshot is that if you identify self-interest with piety, honesty, country, parents and friends, then they are all secure.","And every animal is better or worse from his own merit (virtue) or his own badness. Is there then no virtue in man only? and must we look to the hair, and our clothes and to our ancestors?","If you find yourself acting to impress others, or avoiding action out of fear of what they might think, you have left the path.","But only if I identify with my will can I be someone\u2019s friend \u2013 or son, or father \u2013 in the true sense, because only then will my self-interest be served by remaining loyal, honest, patient, tolerant and supportive, and by maintaining my social relations.","Where are you going to find serenity and independence \u2013 in something free, or something enslaved?","Find satisfaction in following your philosophy. If you want to be respected, start by respecting yourself.","If a person gave your body to any stranger he met on is way, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in handing over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens to verbally attack you?","the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly everything good.","If you wish to be rich, you should know that it is neither a good thing nor at all in your power: but if you wish to be happy, you should know that it is both a good thing and in your power, for the one is a temporary loan of fortune, and happiness comes from the will.","Find your significance within yourself. Within your own sphere of power\u2014that is where you have the greatest consequence.","First, tell yourself what you want to be, then act your part accordingly.","A bad person\u2019s character cannot be trusted, it\u2019s weak and indecisive, easily won over by different impressions at different times.","But I\u2019ll get money, and then share it. If you can acquire riches without losing your honor and self-respect, then do it. But if you lose what is dearest to you, no amount of money can make up for it.\u201d","the Oracle at Delphi\u2014once threw a man out of the temple for abandoning his friend.","Who is there left for me to fear, and over what has he control? Not what is in my power, because no one controls that except myself. As for what is not in my power, in that I take no interest.","The people before whom you bow and tremble \u2013 when I meet them, I treat them as if they were slaves.","has any of you such power as Socrates had, in all his intercourse with men, of winning them over to his own convictions?","Be the same person in public as in private.","Speak only what is useful and beneficial.","Furthermore the true Cynic must know that he is sent as a Messenger from God to men, to show unto them that as touching good and evil they are in error; looking for these where they are not to be found, nor ever bethinking themselves where they are.","Refuse to participate in gossip\u2014tearing down, inflating, and judging other people.","If any be unhappy, let him remember that he is unhappy by reason of himself alone. For God hath made all men to enjoy felicity and constancy of good. CXXIII","What is my position in society? The one best suited to your talents, which you can hold with honor. Each person has a vital role in society; you are important right where you are. But if you lose your honor in striving for greater (perceived) significance, you become useless.\u201d","When you see a person weeping in sorrow either when a. child goes abroad or when he is dead, or when the man has lost his property, take care that the appearance do not hurry you away with it, as if he were suffering in external things. But straightway make a distinction in your own mind, and be in readiness to say, it is not that which has happened that afflicts this man, for it does not afflict another, but it is the opinion about this thing which afflicts the man. So far as words then do not be unwilling to show him sympathy, and even if it happens so, to lament with him. But take care that you do not. lament internally also.","You do not seem to realize that the mind is subject only to itself. It alone can control it, [13] which shows the force and justice of God\u2019s edict: the strong shall always prevail over the weak.","Just ask whether they put their self-interest in externals or in moral choice. [27] If it\u2019s in externals, you cannot call them friends, any more than you can call them trustworthy, consistent, courageous or free. You cannot even call them human beings, if you think about it. [28] Because it is no human frame of mind that makes people snap at others and insult them, or take to the marketplace the way bandits take to the desert or mountains,\u2217 and behave like bandits in court; or that turns them into depraved lechers and adulterers; or is responsible for all other crimes that people commit against each other.","Do not laugh loudly and obnoxiously.","If you would improve, be content to be thought foolish and dull with regard to externals. Do not desire to be thought to know anything; and though you should appear to others to be somebody, distrust yourself. For be assured, it is not easy at once to keep your will in harmony with nature and to secure externals; but while you are absorbed in the one, you must of necessity neglect the other. XIV","This World is one great City, and one if the substance whereof it is fashioned: a certain period indeed there needs must be, while these give place to those; some must perish for others to succeed; some move and some abide: yet all is full of friends--first God, then Men, whom Nature hath bound by ties of kindred each to each.","Philosophy\u2019s purpose is to illuminate the ways our soul has been infected by unsound beliefs, untrained tumultuous desires, and dubious life choices and preferences that are unworthy of us. Self-scrutiny applied with kindness is the main antidote.","Avoid taking oaths","No man can rob us of our Will\u2014no man can lord it over that!","A person who rarely leaves home, who doesn\u2019t converse with, praise, and encourage others, will not attract friends.","If any of you are serious about being a friend, rid yourself of such attitudes, condemn them and drive them out of your mind. [35] That way, you won\u2019t be hard on yourself, or be forever fighting, second-guessing and tormenting yourself. [36] And then you will be in a condition to befriend others \u2013 forming easy and natural relationships with like-minded people, but capable too of treating unenlightened souls with sympathy and indulgence, remembering that they are ignorant or mistaken about what\u2019s most important. Never be harsh, remember Plato\u2019s dictum: \u2018Every soul is deprived of the truth against its will.\u201983","Happiness is commonly mistaken for passively experienced pleasure or leisure. That conception of happiness is good only as far as it goes. The only worthy object of all our efforts is a flourishing life. True happiness is a verb. It\u2019s the ongoing dynamic performance of worthy deeds. The flourishing life, whose foundation is virtuous intention, is something we continually improvise, and in doing so our souls mature. Our life has usefulness to ourselves and to the people we touch.","Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot harm me,\u201950 he says, and: \u2018If it pleases the gods, so be it.","Proper preparation for the future consists of forming good personal habits.","If you wish to have peace and contentment, release your attachment to all things outside your control. This is the path of freedom and happiness.","Some things are up to us, and some things are not up to us.","So, if you have not been invited to a party, it is because you haven\u2019t paid the price of the invitation. It costs social engagement, conversation, encouragement, and praise. If you are not willing to pay this price, do not be upset when you don\u2019t receive an invitation.","\xbfC\xf3mo se lo que va a pasar? Mi tarea es utilizar lo que ocurra con diligencia y habilidad.","Show them where they go wrong and you will find that they\u2019ll reform. But unless they see it, they are stuck with nothing better than their usual opinion as their practical guide.","If a friend tells you that someone has criticized or insulted you, say, \u201cThey must not know about my other faults, or they would have pointed out those, too.","Rufus43 used to say, \u2018If you have nothing better to do than praise me for it, then my speech was a failure.\u2019 He used to address us in such a way as to make everyone sitting there suppose that someone had informed on them \u2013 that\u2019s how well he intuited the truth, and how vividly he evoked for each one of us our private faults.","I, personally, was never kept from something I wanted, nor had forced upon me something I was opposed to. How did I manage it? I submitted my will to God. He wants me to be sick \u2013 well, then, so do I. He wants me to choose something. Then I choose it. He wants me to desire something, I desire it. He wants me to get something, I want the same; or he doesn\u2019t want me to get it, and I concur.","We get angry because we put too high a premium on things that they can steal. Don\u2019t attach such value to your clothes, and you won\u2019t get angry with the thief who takes them.","keep your language free of obscenities. Do not dip into the gutter in search of cheap laughs.","Nadie puede herirte si t\xfa no lo consientes. S\xf3lo te lastimar\xe1n si crees que has sido lastimado.

For it is no easy feat to hold onto your inner harmony while collecting accolades. When grasping for one, you are likely to drop the other.","Loss and sorrow are only possible with respect to things we own.","Pain too is just a scary mask: look under it and you will see. The body sometimes suffers, but relief is never far behind.","And who can give to another the things which\xa0he has not himself?","La manera en la que evaluamos un insulto, cr\xedtica o desprecio ajeno afecta en gran medida al perjuicio que este nos acaba ocasionando. Un individuo no provocar\xe1 da\xf1o alguno sobre ti al menos que t\xfa lo desees; habr\xe1 logrado lastimarte desde el preciso momento en el que te consideras lastimado.","If reason tells you a pleasure is wholesome and harmless, you may enjoy it in moderation. But take care not to let your happiness gradually become dependent on it.","if you know you are in the right, why fear those who misjudge you?","if anyone should tell you that a particular person has spoken critically of you, don\u2019t bother with excuses or defenses. Just smile and reply, \u201cI guess that person doesn\u2019t know about all my other faults. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have mentioned only these.","You are invincible if nothing outside the will can disconcert you.","There is nothing more inspiring than a speaker who makes clear to his audience that he has need of them.","What else is freedom but the power to live our life the way we want? \u2018Nothing.","If someone turned your body over to just any person who happened to meet you, you would be angry. But are you not ashamed that you turn over your own faculty of judgment to whoever happens along, so that if he abuses you it is upset and confused?","There is nothing more inspiring than a speaker who makes clear to his audience that he has need of them. [37] Tell me \u2013 has anyone who has ever heard you read or discourse felt self-remorse as a result, or experienced self-realization, or afterwards left thinking, \u2018The philosopher touched a nerve there; I can\u2019t go on acting as I have\u2019?","26. The will of nature may be learned from those things in which we don\u2019t distinguish from each other. For example, when our neighbor\u2019s boy breaks a cup, or the like, we are presently ready to say, \u201cThese things will happen. Be assured, then, that when your own cup likewise is broken, you ought to be affected just as when another\u2019s cup was broken. Apply this in like manner to greater things. Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one who would not say, \u201cThis is a human accident.\u201d but if anyone\u2019s own child happens to die, it is presently, \u201cAlas I how wretched am I!\u201d But it should be remembered how we are affected in hearing the same thing concerning others.\u201d","If some pleasure is promised to you and it seductively calls to you, step back and give yourself some time before mindlessly jumping at it. Dispassionately turn the matter over in your mind: Will this pleasure bring but a momentary delight, or real, lasting satisfaction? It makes a difference in the quality of our life and the kind of person we become when we learn how to distinguish between cheap thrills and meaningful, lasting rewards.","If you want not just peace and contentment, but power and wealth too, you may forfeit the former in seeking the latter, and will lose your freedom and happiness along the way. Whenever distress or displeasure arises in your mind, remind yourself, \u201cThis is only my interpretation, not reality itself. Then ask whether it falls within or outside your sphere of power. And, if it is beyond your power to control, let it go.\u201d","When anyone provokes you, remember that it is actually your own opinion provoking you. It is not the person who insults or attacks you who torments your mind, but the view you take of these things. Do not be fooled by how things first appear. With time and greater perspective, you can regain inner peace.","If it pleases the gods, so be it.","Tradition has it that late in life Epictetus retired from teaching introduction and withdrew to the peace and quiet of family life, under conditions imposed by old age: that is, he became a parent by adopting rather than fathering a child, and took into his home a female servant to serve as a kind of surrogate mother to the child and domestic servant for himself. That he had absented himself from family life for so long shows that he regarded philosophy as a jealous mistress who demanded practically all his time and attention, which family life would not allow. That this renunciation of family life represented a real sacrifice is suggested by the fact that he took to it immediately upon retiring. He evidently thought he had earned the comforts of home after devoting most of his life to improving the lives of others \u2013 the successive generations of students who had passed through his school. We have no more news of Epictetus beyond this. After creating this version of a family he was evidently content to settle into it and live out the balance of his years in obscurity.","Now is the time to get serious about living your ideals. Once you have determined the spiritual principles you wish to exemplify, abide by these rules as if they were laws, as if it were indeed sinful to compromise them. Don\u2019t mind if others don\u2019t share your convictions. How long can you afford to put off who you really want to be? Your nobler self cannot wait any longer. Put your principles into practice\u2014now. Stop the excuses and the procrastination. This is your life! You aren\u2019t a child anymore. The sooner you set yourself to your spiritual program, the happier you will be. The longer you wait, the more you will be vulnerable to mediocrity and feel filled with shame and regret, because you know you are capable of better. From this instant on, vow to stop disappointing yourself. Separate yourself from the mob. Decide to be extraordinary and do what you need to do\u2014now.","Be confident in everything outside the will, and cautious in everything under the will\u2019s control.","Whether human affairs are directed by Fate\u2019s unalterable necessity, or by chance, is a question. The wisest of philosophers disagree on this point. [Epicureans] insist that heaven is unconcerned with our birth and death \u2013 is unconcerned, in fact, with human beings generally \u2013 with the result that good people often suffer while wicked people thrive. [The Stoics] disagree, maintaining that although things happen according to fate, this depends not on the movement of the planets but on the principles and logic of natural causality. This school concedes to us the freedom to choose our own lives. Once the choice is made, however, the Stoics warn that the subsequent sequence of events cannot be altered. With regard to practical matters they maintain that popular ideas of good and bad are wrong: many people who appear to be in dire circumstances are actually happy provided they deal with their situation bravely; others, regardless of how many possessions they have, are miserable, because they do not know how to use the gifts of fortune wisely.","Tell us your secrets.\u2019 [23] \u2018I refuse, as this is up to me.\u2019 \u2018I will put you in chains.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s that you say, friend? It\u2019s only my leg you will chain, not even God can conquer my will.\u2019 [24] \u2018I will throw you into prison.\u2019 \u2018Correction \u2013 it is my body you will throw there.\u2019 \u2018I will behead you.\u2019 \u2018Well, when did I ever claim that mine was the only neck that couldn\u2019t be severed?","In any events, however seemingly dire, there is nothing to prevent us from searching for its hidden opportunity. It is a failure of the imagination not to do so. But to seek out the opportunity in situations requires a great deal of courage, for most people around you will persist in interpreting events in the grossest terms: success or failure, good or bad, right or wrong. These simplistic, polarized categories obscure more creative\u2014and useful\u2014interpretations of events that are far more advantageous and interesting! The wise person knows it is fruitless to project hopes and fears on the future. This only leads to forming melodramatic representations in your mind and wasting time. At the same time, one shouldn\u2019t passively acquiesce to the future and what it holds. Simply doing nothing does not avoid risk, but heightens it.","But what master, I wonder, do you yourself serve? Money? Women? Boys? The emperor or one of his subordinates? It has to be one of them, or you wouldn\u2019t fret about such things.","Times relieves the foolish from sorrow, but reason relieves the wise","And yet, while there is only the one thing we can care for and devote ourselves to, we choose instead to care about and attach ourselves to a score of others: to our bodies, to our property, to our family, friends and slaves.","And yet, while there is only the one thing we can care for and devote ourselves to, we choose instead to care about and attach ourselves to a score of others: to our bodies, to our property, to our family, friends and slaves.

But if we direct it at what is outside us and is none of our responsibility, wanting instead to avoid what\u2019s in the control of others, we are necessarily going to meet with fear, upset and confusion.","If you take care of it and identify with it, you will never be blocked or frustrated; you won\u2019t have to complain, and never will need to blame or flatter anyone.","the ability to make good use of impressions","Make the best use of what is in our power, and treat the rest in accordance with its nature.

A scary mask. Take it off \u2013 see, it doesn\u2019t bite.","What disturbs men\'s minds is not events but their judgements on events: For instance, death is nothing dreadful, or else Socrates would have thought it so. No, the only dreadful thing about it is men\'s judgement that it is dreadful. And so when we are hindered, or disturbed, or distressed, let us never lay the blame on others, but on ourselves, that is, on our own judgements. To accuse others for one\'s own misfortunes is a sign of want of education; to accuse oneself shows that one\'s education has begun; to accuse neither oneself nor others shows that one\'s education is complete.","Two elements are combined in our creation, the body, which we have in common with the beasts; and reason and good judgement, which we share with the gods. Most of us tend toward the former connection, miserable and mortal though it is, whereas only a few favour this holy and blessed alliance.","When someone is properly grounded in life, they shouldn\u2019t have to look outside themselves for approval.","If you wish to be free, do not desire anything that depends on another, lest you make them your master.","If the Divine is faithful, he also must be faithful; if free, he also must be free; if beneficent, he also must be beneficent; if magnanimous, he also must be magnanimous. Thus as an imitator of God must he follow Him in every deed and word.","What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about the things. For example, death is nothing dreadful (or else it would have appeared dreadful to Socrates), but instead the judgment about death that it is dreadful\u2014that is what is dreadful. So when we are thwarted or upset or distressed, let us never blame someone else but rather ourselves, that is, our own judgments. An uneducated person accuses others when he is doing badly; a partly educated person accuses himself, an educated person accuses neither someone else nor himself.","\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0642\u0644 \xab\u0641\u0642\u062f\u062a\u0651\u0629\xbb ... \u0642\u0644 \xab\u0631\u062f\u062f\u062b\u0647\xbb.\u0641\u0647\u0644 \u064a\u064f\u0647\u0650\u0645\u064f\u0643 \u0628\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631\u062f\u064c \u0645\u0646\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0628\u064c \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u0637\u0649\u061f!","Act Well the Part That Is Given to You We are like actors in a play.

We might be assigned the part of a poor person, a cripple, a distinguished celebrity or public leader, or an ordinary private citizen. Although we can\u2019t control which roles are assigned to us, it must be our business to act our given role as best as we possibly can and to refrain from complaining about it.

I will not be so insensible of what I already own.","Consider how we apply the idea of freedom to animals. [25] There are tame lions that people cage, raise, feed and take with them wherever they go. Yet who will call such a lion free? The easier its life, the more slavish it is. No lion endowed with reason and discretion would choose to be one of these pet specimens.","[Epictetus] believes that God gave man the means to fulfill all his obligations; that these means are within his power, that happiness is attained through what we are capable of, this being the reason God gave them to us. Our mind cannot be forced to believe what is false, nor our will compelled to love something that makes it unhappy. These two powers are therefore free, and it is through them that we can become perfect.","Never say about anything, \u201cI have lost it, but instead, \u201cI have given it back.\u201d","30. *Appropriate actions are largely set by our social relationships. In the case of one\u2019s father, this involves looking after him, letting him have his way in everything, and not making a fuss if he is abusive or violent. \u201cBut what if he\u2019s a bad father?  Do you think you have a *natural affinity only to a good father? \u201cNo, just to a father.\u201d Suppose your brother treats you badly. In that case, maintain your fraternal relationship to him. Don\u2019t think about why he behaves that way but about what you need to do to keep your will in harmony with nature.

So decide now that you are worthy of living as a full-grown man who is making progress, and make everything that seems best to be a law that you cannot go against. And if you meet with any hardship or anything pleasant or reputable or disreputable, then remember that the contest is now . . . and you cannot put things off anymore and that your progress is made or destroyed by a single day and a single action.","If you intend to improve, throw away such thoughts as these: if I neglect my affairs, I shall not have the means of living: unless I chastise my slave, he will be bad. For it is better to die of hunger and so to be released from grief and fear than to live in abundance with perturbation; and it is better for your slave to be bad than for you to be unhappy.","Life is a piece of music, and you\u2019re supposed to be dancing.","If a person had handed over your body to a stranger, you would certainly be angry. So why do you not feel any shame in handing over your own mind to any criticiser, to be unsettled and annoyed.","He didn\u2019t care; it was not his skin he wanted to save, but the man of honour and integrity. These things are not open to compromise or negotiation.","Then I\u2019ll have you chained up.\u2019 What are you saying, man, chain me up? You can chain my leg, but not even Zeus can overcome my power of choice. [24] \u2018I\u2019ll throw you into prison.\u2019 You mean my poor body. \u2018I\u2019ll have you beheaded.\u2019 Why, did I ever tell you that I\u2019m the only man to have a neck that can\u2019t be severed? [","If then you desire (aim at) such great things, remember that you must not (attempt to) lay hold of them with a small effort; but you must leave alone some things entirely, and postpone others for the present.","Show me a man who though sick is happy, who though in danger is happy, who though in prison is happy, and I\'ll show you a Stoic.","If you wish to have peace and contentment, release your attachment to all things outside your control. This is the path of freedom and happiness. If you want not just peace and contentment, but power and wealth too, you may forfeit the former in seeking the latter, and will lose your freedom and happiness along the way.","Freedom is not achieved by satisfying desire, but by eliminating it.","Two elements are combined in our creation, the body, which we have in common with the beasts; and reason and good judgement, which we share with the gods.","but we should rather believe the philosophers who say that the educated only are free. How is this? In this manner: Is freedom anything else than the power of living as we choose? Nothing else.","Don\u2019t give in to second thoughts, because no one who wavers will make progress","We must endure, and toil without complaining.","practice saying to every harsh appearance,1 You are an appearance, and in no manner what you appear to be.","Look at the matter in this way. Since we can see that a dog is fitted by nature to do one thing, and a horse to do another, and a nightingale, if you like, to do yet another, it wouldn\u2019t be absurd for one to declare overall that each of them is beautiful precisely in so far as it best fulfils its own nature; and since each is different in nature, it would seem to me that each of them is beautiful in a different way. Isn\u2019t that so? The student agreed.","But they have produced such wonderful fruit in a human mind, as part of their plan to bestow on humanity the true secret of happiness.","[8] Consider who it is that you praise when you praise people dispassionately: is it those who are just, or unjust?\u2014\u2018Those who are just.\u2019\u2014The temperate or the intemperate?\u2014\u2018The temperate.\u2019\u2014The self-controlled or the dissolute?\u2014\u2018The self-controlled.\u2019 [9] \u2014You should know, then, that if you make yourself a person of that kind, you\u2019ll be making yourself beautiful; but if you neglect these virtues, you\u2019re bound to be ugly, whatever techniques you adopt to make yourself appear beautiful.","For sheep don\u2019t throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you likewise not show theorems to the unlearned, but the actions produced by them after they have been digested.","What are you going to get when you trade your freedom away? Check to see what your proud new possessions will be worth.","If you do not wish to be prone to anger, do not feed the habit; give it nothin which may tend to its increase. At first, keep quiet and count the days when you were not angry: \\"I used to be angry every day, then every other day: next, every two, then every three days!\\" and if you succeed in passing thirty days, sacrifice to the gods in thanksgiving.","Do you realize that you are awake?\u2019 \u2018No, any more than when I dream and have the impression that I am awake.\u2019 \u2018And is the one impression in no way different from the other?\u2019 \u2018No.","You see, then, that it is necessary for you to become a student, thatcreature which every one laughs at, if you really desire to make anexamination of your judgements. But this, as you are quite aware,is not the work of a single hour or day","well as the others, namely, the faculty of reason. Reason is unique among the faculties assigned","There are things that are within our power, and things that fall outside our power. Within our power are our own opinions, aims, desires, dislikes\u2014in sum, our own thoughts and actions.","Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one who would not say, \u201cThis is an accident of mortality. But if anyone\u2019s own child happens to die, it is immediately, \u201cAlas! how wretched am I!\u201d It should be always remembered how we are affected on hearing the same thing concerning others.\u201d","True peace is characterized by nothing so much as steadiness and imperturbability.","Whenever we do something wrong, then, from now on we will not blame anything except the opinion on which it\u2019s based; and we will try to root out wrong opinions with more determination than we remove tumours or infections from the body. [36]","Diogenes says somewhere that one way to guarantee freedom is to be ready to die.","Good luck frees many men from punishment, but no man from fear.","If God had created colours, but not the faculty of vision, colours would have been of little use. [4] Or if God had created vision, but not made sure that objects could be seen, vision would have been worthless. [5] And even if he had made them both, but not created light \u2013 [6] then neither would have been of any value. So who contrived this universal accommodation of things to one another? Who fitted the sword to the scabbard and the scabbard to the sword? No one?","If you are kissing your child or wife, say that it is a human being whom you are kissing, for when the wife or child dies, you will not be disturbed.","Thus do the more cautious of travellers act. The road is said to be beset by robbers. The traveller will not venture alone, but awaits the companionship on the road of an ambassador, a quaestor or a proconsul. To him he attaches himself and thus passes by in safety. So doth the wise man in the world.","It is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already knows.","Be sure to foresee whatever can be foreseen by planning. Observe and avoid, long before it happens, anything that is likely to do you harm. To effect this your best assistance will be a spirit of confidence and a mind strongly resolved to endure all things. He who can bear Fortune, can also beware of Fortune. At any rate, there is no dashing of billows when the sea is calm. And there is nothing more wretched or foolish than premature fear. What madness it is to anticipate one\'s troubles!","The reason why I lost my lamp was that the thief was superior to me in vigilance. He paid however this price for the lamp, that in exchange for it he consented to become a thief: in exchange for it, to become faithless.","Remember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you? Do not stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not yearn in desire toward it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods. And if you do not so much as take the things which are set before you, but are able even to forego them, then you will not only be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them also.","I can only suppose that you weigh all those negatives against the worth of the show, and choose, in the end, to be patient and put up with it all.","The man has to learn \u2018what each specific thing means\u2019, as Socrates often said, and stop casually applying preconceptions to individual cases.","[19] \u2018My brother shouldn\u2019t have treated me in this way.\u2019 Indeed he shouldn\u2019t, but it\u2019s for him to see to that. For my part, however he treats me, I should conduct myself towards him as I ought. For that is my business, and the rest is not my concern. In this no one can hinder me, while everything else is subject to hindrance.","But it is within your power to avoid disappointment, by directing your desires to things that are rightfully yours to obtain and control.","Instead of meeting misfortune with groans and tears, I will call upon the faculty especially provided to deal with it.","Some things are up to us and some are not up to us. Our opinions are up to us, and our impulses, desires, aversions \u2013 in short, whatever is our own doing. Our bodies are not up to us, nor are our possessions, our reputations, or our public offices. . .","Whatever your vocation, pursue it wholeheartedly. Consider, choose, and commit."]')}}]);
