And that process is continuing day be day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except the endless present in which the party is always right.","Real power is achieved when the ruling class controls the material essentials of life, granting and withholding them from the masses as if they were privileges.","In a time of universal deceit - telling the truth is a revolutionary act.","Free speech is my right to say what you don\'t want to hear.","The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became the truth.","A society becomes totalitarian when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial: that is, when its ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud.","It\'s frightful that people who are so ignorant should have so much influence.","He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it.","Some ideas are so stupid that only intellectuals believe them.","There is no swifter route to the corruption of thought than through the corruption of language","Threats to freedom of speech, writing and action, though often trivial in isolation, are cumulative in their effect and, unless checked, lead to a general disrespect for the rights of the citizen.","So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who don\'t even know that fire is hot.","However much you deny the truth, the truth goes on existing.","We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.","Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing.","Political language... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.","Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.","That rifle hanging on the wall of the working-class flat or labourer\'s cottage is the symbol of democracy. It is our job to see that it stays there.","The real test of character is how you treat someone who has no possibility of doing you any good.","We are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue, and then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right.","Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations.","One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes a revolution in order to establish a dictatorship.","From the totalitarian point of view, history is something to be created rather than learned.","If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever.","If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.","The real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.","In our age there is no such thing as \'keeping out of politics.\' All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia.","A generation of the unteachable is hanging upon us like a necklace of corpses.","It\'s not so much staying alive, it\'s staying human that\'s important. What counts is that we don\'t betray each other.","All rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers.","We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men.","Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power.","Everyone believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side, without ever bothering to examine the evidence.","At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas of which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question. It is not exactly forbidden to say this, that or the other, but it is \'not done\' to say it... Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing, either in the popular press or in the high-brow periodicals.","Whoever controls the image and information of the past determines what and how future generations will think; whoever controls the information and images of the present determines how those same people will view the past.\\" \\"He who controls the past commands the future. He who commands the future conquers the past.","When I see a policeman with a club beating a man on the ground, I don\'t have to ask whose side I\'m on.","All that was required of them (i.e. the brain-washed masses) was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because, being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice.","Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress toward more pain.","War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.","The process [of mass-media deception] has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt.... To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies all this is indispensably necessary.","Despotic governments can stand \'moral force\' till the cows come home; what they fear is physical force.","Right thinking will be rewarded, wrong thinking punished.","The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world. Lies will pass into history.","True freedom is the right to say something that others don\'t want to hear.","I enjoy talking to you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane.","One must choose between God and Man, and all \\"radicals\\" and \\"progressives\\", from the mildest liberal to the most extreme anarchist, have in effect chosen Man.","War against a foreign country only happens when the moneyed classes think they are going to profit from it.","England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings. It is a strange fact, but it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during God save the King than of stealing from a poor box.","The totalitarian states can do great things, but there is one thing they cannot do: they cannot give the factory-worker a rifle and tell him to take it home and keep it in his bedroom.  That rifle, hanging on the wall of the working-class flat or laborer\'s cottage, is the symbol of democracy. It is our job to see that it stays there.","Politics is the choice between the lesser of two evils.","All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.","The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command. His heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was in the right! They were wrong and he was right.","Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.","The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental , nor do they result from from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate exercises in doublethink","Totalitarianism, however, does not so much promise an age of faith as an age of schizophrenia. A society becomes totalitarian when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial: that is, when its ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud. Such a society, no matter how long it persists, can never afford to become either tolerant or intellectually stable.","Freedom of the Press, if it means anything at all, means the freedom to criticize and oppose","Either we all live in a decent world, or nobody does.","We have sunk so low it has become the obligation of every decent, thinking individual to re-state the obvious!","In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four.","In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible... Thus, political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging, and sheer cloudy vagueness... Political language [is] designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable.","They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening","There are some ideas so wrong that only a very intelligent person could believe in them.","Truth becomes untruth if uttered by your enemy","To be corrupted by totalitarianism, one does not have to live in a totalitarian country.","The war is not meant to be won, it is meant to be continuous.","Don\u2019t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.","The object of terrorism is terrorism. The object of oppression is oppression. The object of torture is torture. The object of murder is murder. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?","Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else.","A totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible. But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened.","Using clich\xe9s is a substitute for thinking","The fallacy is to believe that under a dictatorial government you can be free inside","A man may take to drink because he feels himself to he a \\n failure, and then fail all the more completely because he \\n drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the \\n English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because \\n our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language \\n makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.","News is something somebody doesn\'t want printed; all else is advertising.","Beauty is meaningless until it is shared.","The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies \'something not desirable.\'","Rifles, muskets, long-bows and hand-grenades are inherently democratic weapons. A complex weapon makes the strong stronger, while a simple weapon - so long as there is no answer to it - gives claws to the weak.","Men can only be happy when they do not assume that the object of life is happiness.","Freedom is the right to tell others what they don\'t want to hear.","The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.","All the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting.","One sometimes gets the impression that the mere words \' Socialism \' and \' Communism \' draw towards them with magnetic force every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, Quaker, \'Nature Cure\' quack, pacifist, and feminist in England.","The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.","Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one\'s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.","Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.","Real journalism is publishing something that somebody else does not want published - the rest is just public relations.","The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living. A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same.","The typical socialist... a prim little man with a white-collar job, usually a secret teetotaler and often with vegetarian leanings.","Liberal: a power worshipper without power.","Actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them. There is almost no kind of outrage-torture, imprisonment without trial, assassination, the bombing of civilians-which does not change its moral color when it is committed by \'our\' side. The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them.","It is not possible for any thinking person to live in such a society as our own without wanting to change it.","We control matter because we control the mind. Reality is inside the skull.","The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them.","By \'nationalism\' I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions and tens of millions of people can be confidently labeled \'good\' or \'bad\'...By \'patriotism\' I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be best in the world but has no wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power.","The point is that we are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue, and then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right. Intellectually, it is possible to carry on this process for an indefinite time: the only check on it is that sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality, usually on a battlefield.","Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.","The aim of a joke is not to degrade the human being, but to remind him that he is already degraded.","On the whole, human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time.","Every Joke is a Tiny Revolution","Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible.","If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate.","To see what is in front of one\u2019s nose needs a constant struggle.","If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation even among people who should and do know better.","Until they became conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.","In a Society in which there is no law, and in theory no compulsion, the only arbiter of behaviour is public opinion. But public opinion, because of the tremendous urge to conformity in gregarious animals, is less tolerant than any system of law. When human beings are governed by \\"thou shalt not\\", the individual can practise a certain amount of eccentricity: when they are supposedly governed by \\"love\\" or \\"reason\\", he is under continuous pressure to make him behave and think in exactly the same way as everyone else.","Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print. Never use a long word where a short one will do. If it is possible to cut a word out always cut it out. Never use the passive voice where you can use the active. Never use a foreign phrase a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.","Rich people are poor people with money.","Comrades!\' he cried. \'You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually dislike milk and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig. We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink the milk and eat those apples.","We believe half-instinctively that evil always defeats itself in the long run.  Pacifism is founded largely on this belief.  Don\'t resist evil, and it will somehow destroy itself. But why should it? What evidence is there that it does... unless conquered from the outside by military force?","For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realise that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.","The choice before human beings, is not, as a rule, between good and evil but between two evils.","All propaganda is lies, even when one is telling the truth.","Early in life I had noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper.","One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool.","The upper class desire to remain so, the middle class wish to overthrow the upper class, and the lower class want a classless system.","All left-wing parties in the highly industrialized countries are at bottom a sham, because they make it their business to fight against something which they do not really wish to destroy. They have internationalist aims, and at the same time they struggle to keep up a standard of life with which those aims are incompatible. We all live by robbing Asiatic coolies, and those of us who are \'enlightened\' all maintain that those coolies ought to be set free; but our standard of living, and hence our \'enlightenment,\' demands that the robbery shall continue.","As with the Christian religion, the worst advertisement for Socialism is its adherents.","A man receiving charity always hates his benefactor- it is a fixed characteristic of human nature","In this country, intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face ... Unpopular ideas can be silenced, and incovenient facts kept dark, without the need for any official ban ... At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of iedas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question.","The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim-for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives -is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal.","Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.","Good prose should be transparent, like a window pane.","Take away freedom of speech, and the creative faculties dry up.","By \' patriotism \' I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life , which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people.","The choice before human beings, is not, as a rule , between good and evil but between two evils. You can let the Nazis rule the world : that is evil; or you can overthrow them by war , which is also evil. There is no other choice before you, and whichever you choose you will not come out with clean hands.","Totalitarianism, if not fought against, could triumph anywhere.","No advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer.","The way to make a million dollars is to start a religion.","One cannot really be a Catholic and grown up.","Public opinion, because of the tremendous urge to conformity in gregarious animals, is less tolerant than any system of law.","And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed\u2014if all records told the same tale\u2014then the lie passed into history and became truth. \'Who controls the past\' ran the Party slogan, \'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.","To survive it is often necessary to fight and to fight you have to dirty yourself.","The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are: Shakespeare, Swift, Fielding, Dickens, Charles Reade, Flaubert and, among modern writers, James Joyce, T. S. Eliot and D. H. Lawrence. But I believe the modern writer who has influenced me most is Somerset Maugham, whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills.","The capitalists owned everything in the world, and everyone else was their slave. They owned all the land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them they could throw him into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to death. When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as \'Sir\'","Every war, when it comes, or before it comes, is represented not as a war but as an act of self-defense against a homicidal maniac.","Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.","In our time political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.","History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.","Pacifism is objectively pro-Fascist","At fifty everyone has the face he deserves.","This life we live nowadays. It\'s not life, it\'s stagnation death-in-life. Look at all these bloody houses and the meaningless people inside them. Sometimes I think we\'re all corpses. Just rotting upright.","Patriotism has nothing to do with Conservatism. It is actually the opposite of Conservatism, since it is a devotion to something that is always changing and yet is felt to be mystically the same.","But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.","Those who \'abjure\' violence can do so only because others are committing violence on their behalf.","The modern writer who has influenced me most is W. Somerset Maugham .","When I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.","There are some things only intellectuals are crazy enough to believe.","And if our book consumption remains as low as it has been, at least let us admit that it is because reading is a less exciting pastime than going to the dogs, the pictures or the pub, and not because books, whether bought or borrowed, are too expensive.","In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer.","One\'s got to change the system, or one changes nothing.","It is curious how people take it for granted that they have a right to preach at you and pray over you as soon as your income falls below a certain level.","It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself-anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face ... was itself a punishable offense. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime.","Happiness can exist only in acceptance.","I believe that the BBC, in spite of the stupidity of its foreign propaganda and the unbearable voices of its announcers, is very truthful. It is generally regarded here as more reliable than the press.","Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.","Sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality, usually on a battlefield.","Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence. In other words, it is war minus the shooting.","In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane. They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird.","The enemies of intellectual liberty always try to present their case as a plea for discipline versus individualism. The issue truth-versus-untruth is as far as possible kept in the background.","Orthodoxy is the ability to say two and two make five when faith requires it.","We have become too civilized to grasp the obvious. For the truth is very simple. To survive you often have to fight, and to fight you have to dirty yourself. War is evil, and it is often the lesser evil. Those who take the sword perish by the sword, and those who don\'t take the sword perish by smelly diseases.","Myths which are believed in tend to become true.","It is the same in all wars; the soldiers do the fighting, the journalists do the shouting, and no true patriot ever gets near a front-line trench, except on the briefest of propaganda tours.","It was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were also very much the same--everywhere, all over the world, hundreds or thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another\'s existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the same--people who had never learned to think but were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world.","The relative freedom which we enjoy depends of public opinion. The law is no protection. Governments make laws, but whether they are carried out, and how the police behave, depends on the general temper in the country. If large numbers of people are interested in freedom of speech, there will be freedom of speech, even if the law forbids it; if public opinion is sluggish, inconvenient minorities will be persecuted, even if laws exist to protect them.","The object of power is power.","If publishers and editors exert themselves to keep certain topics out of print, it is not because they are frightened of prosecution but because they are frightened of public opinion. In this country intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face, and that fact does not seem to me to have had the discussion it deserves.","Does Big Brother exist?\\" \\"Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the embodiment of the Party.\\" \\"Does he exist in the same way as I exist?\\" \\"You do not exist.","If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones.","Fate seemed to be playing a series of extraordinarily unamusing jokes.","A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: 1. What am I trying to say? 2. What words will express it? 3. What image or idiom will make it clearer? 4. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?","There are books that one reads over and over again, books that become part of the furniture of one\'s mind and alter one\'s whole attitude to life, books that one dips into but never reads through, books that one reads at a single sitting and forgets a week later.","When I talk to anyone or read the writings of anyone who has any axe to grind, I feel that intellectual honesty and balanced judgement have simply disappeared from the face of the earth. Everyone\'s thought is forensic, everyone is simply putting a \\"case\\" with deliberate suppression of his opponent\'s point of view, and, what is more, with complete insensitiveness to any sufferings except those of himself and his friends.","And in the general hardening of outlook that set in ... practices which had been long abandoned ... -- imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages and the deportation of whole populations -- not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive.","The essential point here is that all people with small, insecure incomes are in the same boat and ought to be fighting on the same side. Probably we could do with a little less talk about\' capitalist\' and \'proletarian\' and a little more about the robbers and the robbed.","By using stale metaphors, similes and idioms, you save much mental effort, at the cost of leaving your meaning vague, not only for your reader but for yourself.","Progress is not an illusion, it happens, but it is slow and invariably disappointing.","The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.","It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children","The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one\'s real and one\'s declared aims, one turns, as it were, instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink.","What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked upon as a matter of indifference. They can be granted intellectual liberty becasue they have no intellect.","Big Brother is watching you.","We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.","Pacifism is objectively pro-fascist. This is elementary common sense. If you hamper the war effort of one side, you automatically help out that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, \'he that is not with me is against me\'.","He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother","No one believes more firmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal. He would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be?","It is one of the tragedies of the half-educated that they develop late, when they are already committed to some wrong way of life.","It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it; consequently, the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning.","What can you do against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?","The planting of a tree, especially one of the long-living hardwood trees, is a gift which you can make to posterity at almost no cost and with almost no trouble, and if the tree takes root it will far outlive the visible effect of any of your other actions, good or evil.","The energy that actually shapes the world springs from emotions - racial pride, leader-worship, religious belief, love of war - which liberal intellectuals mechanically write off as anachronisms, and which they have usually destroyed so completely in themselves as to have lost all power of action.","Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self-deception.","Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout with some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.","All the papers that matter live off their advertisements, and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over news.","I do not wish to comment on the work; if it does not speak for itself, it is a failure.","The tendency of advanced capitalism has been to enlarge the middle class and not to wipe it out, as it once seemed likely to do.","Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do doesn\'t matter; only feelings matter. If they could make me stop loving you-that would be the real betrayal.","The past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon.","You must be an intellectual. A normal person would never believe a thing like that.","If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable - what then?","Patriotism is usually stronger than class hatred, and always stronger than internationalism.","The plant is blind but it knows enough to keep pushing upwards towards the light, and it will continue to do this in the face of endless discouragements.","Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal.","The quickest way of ending a war is to lose it.","If there is hope, it lies in the proles.","One defeats a fanatic precisely by not being a fanatic oneself, but on the contrary by using one\'s intelligence.","The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect.","The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection.","We are in a strange period of history in which a revolutionary has to be a patriot and a patriot has to be a revolutionary.","There are some situations from which one can only escape by acting like a devil or a lunatic.","Poverty is spiritual halitosis.","Some people have a knack, for example, of being able to tell when someone\'s lying to them. They may not know what the truth is, but they can tell when someone is trying to lead them astray or sell them something shady. I think he had that ability to an amazing degree. I also think he thought, without saying it explicitly, that you can convince a crowd of something that\'s not true more easily than you can one person at a time.","In the end I worked out an anarchistic theory that all government is evil, that the punishment always does more harm than the crime and that people can be trusted to behave decently if only you will let them alone.","Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals.","The fact is that every war suffers a kind of progressive degradation with every month that it continues, because such things as individual liberty and a truthful press are simply not compatible with military efficiency.","To write or even speak English is not a science but an art. There are no reliable words. Whoever writes English is involved in a struggle that never lets up even for a sentence. He is struggling against vagueness, against obscurity, against the lure of the decorative adjective, against the encroachment of Latin and Greek, and, above all, against the worn-out phrases and dead metaphors with which the language is cluttered up.","The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.","To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulne\xadss while telling carefully constructe\xadd lies, to hold simultaneo\xadusly two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradict\xadory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy.","To accept civilization as it is practically means accepting decay.","If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.","In the face of pain there are no heroes.","Circus dogs jump when the trainer cracks his whip, but the really well-trained dog is the one that turns his somersault when there is no whip.","But what is work and what is not work?  Is it work to dig, to carpenter, to plant trees, to fell trees, to ride, to fish, to hunt, to feed chickens, to play the piano, to take photographs, to build a house, to cook, to sew, to trim hats, to mend motor bicycles?  All of these things are work to somebody, and all of them are play to somebody.  There are in fact very few activities which cannot be classed either as work or play according as you choose to regard them.","One can love a child, perhaps, more deeply than one can love another adult, but it is rash to assume that the child feels any love in return.","Contrary to popular belief, the past was not more eventful than the present. If it seems so it is because when you look backward things that happened years apart are telescoped together, and because very few of your memories come to you genuinely virgin.","Political writing in our time consists almost entirely of prefabricated phrases bolted together like the pieces of a child\'s Meccano set. It is the unavoidable result of self-censorship. To write in plain, vigorous language one has to think fearlessly, and if one thinks fearlessly one cannot be politically orthodox.","Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.","Man serves the interests of no creature except himself.","The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun.","If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love.","He drove his mind into the abyss where poetry is written.","The books one reads in childhood, and perhaps most of all the bad and good bad books, create in one\'s mind a sort of false map of the world, a series of fabulous countries into which one can retreat at odd moments throughout the rest of life, and which in some cases can survive a visit to the real countries which they are supposed to represent.","Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct; nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary.","A human being is primarily a bag for putting food into.","Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea.","Men use up their lives in heart-breaking political struggles, or get themselves killed in civil wars, or tortured in the secret prisons of the Gestapo, not in order to establish some central-heated, air-conditioned, strip-lighted Paradise, but because they want a world in which human beings love one another instead of swindling and murdering one another.","If you turn the other cheek, you will get a harder blow on it than you got on the first one. This does not always happen, but it is to be expected, and you ought not to complain if it does happen.","The English are not happy unless they are miserable, the Irish are not at peace unless they are at war, and the Scots are not at home unless they are abroad.","I know it is the fashion to say that most of recorded history is lies anyway. I am willing to believe that history is for the most part inaccurate and biased, but what is peculiar to our own age is the abandonment of the idea that history could be truthfully written.","Many people genuinely do not want to be saints, and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human beings.","Creeds like pacifism or anarchism, which seem on the surface to imply a complete renunciation of power, rather encourage this habit of mind. For if you have embraced a creed which appears to be free from the ordinary dirtiness of politics ... the more you are in the right (and) everybody else should be bullied into thinking otherwise.","This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half.","So long as I remain alive and well I shall continue to feel strongly about prose style, to love the surface of the earth, and to take a pleasure in solid objects and scraps of useless information.","No one is patriotic about taxes.","The smell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become a physical necessity.","Nearly all creators of Utopia have resembled the man who has toothache, and therefore thinks happiness consists in not having toothache. They wanted to produce a perfect society by an endless continuation of something that had only been valuable because it was temporary. The wider course would be to say that there are certain lines along which humanity must move, the grand strategy is mapped out, but detailed prophecy is not our business. Whoever tries to imagine perfection simply reveals his own emptiness.","If you have no money, men won\'t care for you, women won\'t love you; won\'t, that is, care for you or love you the last little bit that matters.","Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism as I understand it.","To exchange one orthodoxy for another is not necessarily an advance. The enemy is the gramophone mind, whether or not one agrees with the record that is being played at the moment.","[A] world in which it is wrong to murder an individual civilian and right to drop a thousand tons of high explosive on a residential area does sometimes make me wonder whether this earth of ours is not a loony bin made use of by some other planet. Not to have a national anthem would be logical.","He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear. But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken. It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage.","I sometimes think that the price of liberty is not so much eternal vigilance as eternal dirt.","The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.","I watched him [a \'fat Russian agent\'] with some interest, for it was the first time that I had seen a person whose profession was telling lies -- unless one counts journalists.","It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.","When I joined the militia I had promised myself to kill one Fascist - after all, if each of us killed one they would soon be extinct.","There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live-did live, from habit that became instinct-in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.","So long as they (the Proles) continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern...Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbors, films, football, beer and above all, gambling filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult.","you can\'t live life without consequences. They occur regardless of the decision. A consequence is an outcome, good or bad. You can live life without regrets and thats what makes it worth it. Or you could live with regret and end up hanging yourself but thats still good. You paid for the rope so your feeding someones family. Something to be proud of before you kick the bucket","In this game that we\'re playing, we can\'t win. Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds, that\'s all.","It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty. It would never endure.\' \'Why not?\' \'It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would commit suicide.","The prime necessities for success in life are money, athleticism, tailor made clothes and a charming smile.","I always disagree, however, when people end up saying that we can only combat Communism, Fascism or what not if we develop an equal fanaticism. It appears to me that one defeats the fanatic precisely by not being a fanatic oneself, but on the contrary by using one\'s intelligence.","The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another.","Good novels are not written by orthodoxy-sniffers, nor by people who are conscience-stricken about their own unorthodoxy. Good novels are written by people who are not frightened.","All nationalistic distinctions - all claims to be better than somebody else because you have a different-shaped skull or speak a different dialect - are entirely spurious, but they are important so long as people believe in them.","The whole idea of revenge and punishment is a childish day-dream. Properly speaking, there is no such thing as revenge. Revenge is an act which you want to commit when you are powerless and because you are powerless: as soon as the sense of impotence is removed, the desire evaporates also.","Think of something you really care about. Then add hour to hour and calculate the fraction of your life that you\'ve actually spent in doing it. And then calculate the time you\'ve spent on things like shaving, riding to and fro on buses, waiting in railway junctions, swapping dirty stories, and reading the newspapers.","Most people approve of capital punishment, but most people wouldn\'t do the hangman\'s job.","We may find in the long run that tinned food is a deadlier weapon than the machine-gun.","It\'s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words.","The whole question of evolution seems less momentous than it did, because, unlike the Victorians, we do not feel that to be descended from animals is degrading to human dignity.","The main motive for nonattachment is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work.","To talk, simply to talk! It sounds so little, and how much it is! When you have existed to the brink of middle age in bitter loneliness, among people to whom your true opinion on every subject on earth is blasphemy, the need to talk is the greatest of all needs.","Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful.","A thing which I regret, and which I will try to remedy some time, is that I have never in my life planted a walnut. Nobody does plant them nowadays-when you see a walnut it is almost invariably an old tree. If you plant a walnut you are planting it for your grandchildren, and who cares a damn for his grandchildren?","A humanitarian is always a hypocrite.","The real power, the power we have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men","You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.","The stars are a free show; it don\u2019t cost anything to use your eyes","If human equality is to be forever averted -- if the High, as we have called them, are to keep their places permanently -- then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity.","A Socialist United States of Europe seems to me the only worth-while political objective today","Serious sport is war minus the shooting.","No doubt alcohol, tobacco, and so forth, are things that a saint must avoid; but sainthood is also a thing that human beings must avoid.","One of the effects of a safe and civilized life is an immense over sensitiveness which makes all the primary emotions somewhat disgusting.","Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent.","Tragedy, he precieved, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there were still privacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason.","Sheer egoism... Writers share this characteristic with scientists, artists, politicians, lawyers, soldiers, successful businessmen - in short, with the whole top crust of humanity.","When the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys.He becomes a sort of hollow,posing dummy,the conventional figure of a sahib.For it is the condition of his rule that he shall spend his life in trying to impress the \\"natives\\",and so in every crisis he has got to do what the \\"natives\\" expect of him.He wears a mask and his face grows to fit it.","All art is propaganda.","Money writes books, money sells them. Give me not righteousness, O Lord, give me money, only money.","Within any important issue, there are always aspects no one wishes to discuss.","The machine has got to be accepted, but it is probably better to accept it rather as one accepts a drug - that is, grudgingly and suspiciously. Like a drug, the machine is useful, dangerous, and habit-forming. The oftener one surrenders to it the tighter its grip becomes.","For a creative writer possession of the \'truth\' is less important than emotional sincerity.","I understand HOW. I do not understand WHY","If I had understood the situation a bit better I should probably have joined the Anarchists.","You believe that reality is something objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Paty, which is collective and immortal.","After 40, a man is responsible for his face.","[T]he more one is conscious of one\'s political bias, the more chance one has of acting politically without sacrificing one\'s aesthetic and intellectual integrity.","Man\'s greatest drive is not love or hate but to change another person\'s writing.","Lastly, tea--unless one is drinking it in the Russian style--should be drunk WITHOUT SUGAR. I know very well that I am in a minority here. But still, how can you call yourself a true tea-lover if you destroy the flavour of your tea by putting sugar in it? It would be equally reasonable to put in pepper or salt. Tea is meant to be bitter, just as beer is meant to be bitter. If you sweeten it, you are no longer tasting the tea, you are merely tasting the sugar; you could make a very similar drink by dissolving sugar in plain hot water.","To say \\"I accept\\" in an age like our own is to say that you accept concentration-camps, rubber truncheons, Hitler, Stalin, bombs, aeroplanes, tinned food, machine guns, putsches, purges, slogans, Bedaux belts, gas-masks, submarines, spies, provocateurs, press-censorship, secret prisons, aspirins, Hollywood films and political murder.","Language ought to be the joint creation of poets and manual workers.","Certainly all \\"progressive\\" thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security, and avoidance of pain... Hitler, because in his joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don\'t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life.","The more intelligent, the less sane","At any given moment, there is a sort of all pervading orthodoxy, a general tacit agreement not to discuss large and uncomfortable facts.","Lack of money means discomfort, means squalid worries, means shortage of tobacco, means ever-present consciousness of failure-above all, it means loneliness.","You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane.","I\'d like to start a religion. That\'s where the money is.","Friend of fatherless! Fountain of happiness! Lord of the swill-bucket! Oh, how my soul is on Fire when I gaze at thy Calm and commanding eye. Like the sun in the sky, Comrade Napoleon! Thou are the giver of All thy creatures love, Full belly twice a day, clean straw to roll upon; Every beast great or small, Sleeps at peace in his stall, Thou watchest over all, Comrade Napoleon! Had I a sucking-pig, Ere he had grown as big Even as a pint bottle or a a rolling-pin He should have learned to be Faithful and true to thee, Yes, his first squeak should be Comrade Napoleon!","Preventive war is a crime not easily committed by a country that retains any traces of democracy.","Circus dogs jump when the trainer cracks his whip.","When the white man turns tyrant, it is his own freedom that he destroys","The urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever.","England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality.","The English are probably more capable than most peoples of making revolutionary change without bloodshed. In England, if anywhere,it would be possible to abolish poverty without destroying liberty.","No one can look back on his schooldays and say with truth that they were altogether unhappy.","Always eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or bed- no escape. Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimeters in your skull.","It is fatal to look hungry. It makes people want to kick you.","It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage.","The truth, it is felt, becomes untruth when your enemy utters it.","Winston Smith: Does Big Brother exist? O\'Brien: Of course he exists. Winston Smith: Does he exist like you or me? O\'Brien: You do not exist.","Mankind is not likely to salvage civilization unless he can evolve a system of good and evil which is independent of heaven and hell.","The Puritanical nonsense of excluding children and therefore to some extent women from pubs has turned these places into mere boozing shops instead of the family gathering places that they ought to be.","The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labor. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.","Oceania was at war with Eurasia; therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.","In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for \'Science.\' The empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc.","Apparently nothing will ever teach these people that the other 99 % of the population exist.","He was an embittered atheist, the sort of atheist who does not so much disbelieve in God as personally dislike Him.","You\'re only a rebel from the waist downwards,\' he told her.","You are a slow learner, Winston.\\" \\"How can I help it? How can I help but see what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four.\\" \\"Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane.","If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out","No animal shall kill any other animal WITHOUT CAUSE.","It was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism, tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in common. This was what came of rebelling against the laws of Nature, Frederick and Pilkington said.","In all the modern talk about energy, efficiency, social service and the rest of it, what meaning is there except \\"Get money, get it legally, and get a lot of it\\"? Money has become the grand test of virtue.","Is the English press honest or dishonest? At normal times it is deeply dishonest. All the papers that matter live off their advertisements, and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over news. Yet I do not suppose there is one paper in England that can be straightforwardly bribed with hard cash. In the France of the Third Republic all but a very few of the newspapers could notoriously be bought over the counter like so many pounds of cheese.","All art is propaganda; on the other hand, not all propaganda is art.","The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outlines and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity.","When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases - bestial atrocities, iron heel, blood-stained tyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder - one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy, the appropriate noises are coming out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved","His answer to every problem, every setback was \u201cI will work harder!\u201d \u2014which he had adopted as his personal motto.","Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.","Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.","If I had to make a list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would certainly put Gulliver\'s Travels among them.","It is a mysterious thing, the loss of faith-as mysterious as faith itself. Like faith, it is ultimately not rooted in logic; it is a change in the climate of the mind.","Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.","For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable \u2013 what then?","Don\'t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?","Never use a long word where a short one will do.","All true tea lovers not only like their tea strong, but like it a little stronger with each year that passes.","For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years.","A dirty joke is a sort of mental rebellion.","If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself. You must know all the while that it is there, but until it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape that can be given a name.","We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future.","Let\'s face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short.","Man is the only creature that consumes without producing","But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire.  They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies.  If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning.  Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it?  And yet --!","If one looks closely one sees that there is no essential difference between a beggar\'s livelihood and that of numberless respectable people. Beggars do not work, it is said; but then, what is work? A navvy works by swinging a pick. An accountant works by adding up figures. A beggar works by standing out of doors in all weathers and getting varicose veins, chronic bronchitis, etc. It is a trade like any other; quite useless, of course - but then, many reputable trades are quite useless.","It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought...should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words.","The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education and fine arts.\\nThe Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war.\\nThe Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order.\\nAnd the Ministry of Plenty, which is responsible for economic affairs.\\ntheir names, in Newspeak:\\nMinitrue, Minipax, Miniluv and Miniplenty","To hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one\'s lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available.","By preaching the doctrine that nothing is to be admired except steel and concrete, one merely makes it a little surer that human beings will have no outlet for their surplus energy except in hatred and leader worship.","Where this age differs from those immediately preceding it is that a liberal intelligentsia is lacking. Bully-worship, under various disguises, has become a universal religion, and such truisms as that a machine-gun is still a machine-gun even when a \\"good\\" man is squeezing the trigger have turned into heresies which it is actually becoming dangerous to utter.","The primary aim of modern warfare ... is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.","People invent new machines and improve existing ones almost unconsciously, rather as a Somnambulist will go walking in his sleep. The interesting puzzle in our times is that we so willingly sleepwalk through the process of reconstituting the conditions of human existence.","The secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one\u2019s own infallibility with a power to learn from past mistakes.","When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, \'I am going to produce a work of art.\' I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing.","People talk about the horrors of war, but what weapon has a man invented that even approaches in cruelty some of the commoner diseases? \'Natural\' death, almost by defintion, means something slow, smelly and painful.","While the game of deadlocks and bottle-necks goes on, another more serious game is also being played. It is governed by two axioms. One is that there can be no peace without a general surrender of sovereignty: the other is that no country capable of defending its sovereignty ever surrenders it. If one keeps these axioms in mind one can generally see the relevant facts in international affairs through the smoke-screen with which the newspapers surround them.","The fact is that certain themes cannot be celebrated in words, and tyranny is one of them. No one ever wrote a good book in praise of the Inquisition.","The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself. WHO wields power is not important, provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same.","Winston worked in the RECORDS DEPARTMENT (a single branch of the Ministry of Truth) editing and writing for The Times. He dictated into a machine called a Speakwrite. Winston would receive articles or news-items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, in Newspeak, rectify. If, for example, the Ministry of Plenty forecast a surplus, and in reality the result was grossly less, Winston\'s job was to change previous versions so the old version would agree with the new one.","The common people, on the whole, are still living in the world of absolute good and evil from which the intellectuals have long since escaped.","Bad writers are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones.","The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. Past events, it is argued, have no objective existance, but survive only in written records and in human memories. The past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records, and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever the Party chooses to make it.","From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:\\nWAR IS PEACE\\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY\\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.","And the bigger the fall, the bigger the joke. It would be better fun to throw a custard pie at a bishop than at a curate.","The only thing for which we can combine is the underlying ideal of Socialism; justice and liberty. But it is hardly strong enough to call this ideal underlying. It is almost completely forgotten. It has been buried beneath layer after layer of doctnaire priggishness, party squabbles and half-backed progressivism until it is like a diamond hidden under a monition of dung. The job of the Socialist is to get it out again. Justice and liberty! Those are the words that have got to ring like a bugle across the world.","It was true that there was no such person as Comrade Oglivy, but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence... Comrade Oglivy, who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.","You had to live - did live, from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that evey sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every moment scrutinized.","If you can feel that staying human is worth while, even when it can\'t have any practical result whatsoever, you\'ve beaten them.","Nearly all creators of Utopia have resembled the man who has toothache, and therefore thinks happiness consists in not having toothache... Whoever tries to imagine perfection simply reveals his own emptiness.","The Party is not interested in the overt act. The thought is all we care about.","A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outline and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one\'s real and one\'s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as \'keeping out of politics\'. All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia. When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer.","I felt as if I was the only person awake in a city of sleepwalkers. That\'s an illusion, of course. When you walk through a crowd of strangers it\'s next door to impossible not to imagine that they\'re all waxworks, but probably they\'re thinking just the same about you.","[What Hayek] does not see, or will not admit, [is] that a return to \\"free\\" competition means for the great mass of people a tyranny probably worse, because more irresponsible, than that of the State. The trouble with competitions is that somebody wins them. Professor Hayek denies that free capitalism necessarily leads to monopoly, but in practice that is where it has led, and since the vast majority of people would far rather have State regimentation than slumps and unemployment, the drift towards collectivism is bound to continue if popular opinion has any say in the matter.","...in the negative part of Professor\'s Hayek\'s thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too often - at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough - that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of.","We of the sinking middle class may sink without further struggles into the working class where we belong, and probably when we get there it will not be so dreadful as we feared, for, after all, we have nothing to lose.","The war is waged against its own subjects and its object is not the victory...but to keep the very structure of society intact.","In the past the need for a hierarchal form of society has been the doctrine specifically of the High. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats and the priests, lawyers and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generally been softened by promises of an imaginary world beyond the grave.","For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which one had to live.","The belly comes before the soul.","The secret of a successful restaurant is sharp knives.","The heresy of heresies was common sense.","The high-water mark, so to speak, of Socialist literature is W.H. Auden, a sort of gutless Kipling.","As soon as you think of fishing you think of things that don\'t belong to the modern world. The very idea of sitting all day under a willow tree beside a quiet pool - and being able to find a quiet pool to sit beside- belongs to a time before the war, before radio, before aeroplanes, before Hitler.","In my opinion, nothing has contributed so much to the corruption of the original idea of socialism as the belief that Russia is a socialist country and that every act of its rulers must be excused, if not imitated. And so for the last ten years, I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement.","She was very young...she still expected something from life, she did not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing.","I doubt whether classical education ever has been or can be successfully carried out without corporal punishment.","A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one\'s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.","It was with the last revolution and the coming of INGSOC (Inglish/English Socialism) that the latest High learnt how to keep their position permanently - by cultivating ignorance among the other classes and by constantly surveying them through the Thought Police. Part of this strategy included the maintenance of a state of continual warfare, which Goldstein discussed in the third chapter. The three major powers were not fighting this perpetual war for victory; they were fighting to keep a state of emergency always present as the surest guarantee of authoritarianism.","But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him; the horror was that he might also be wrong.","Since pacifists have more freedom of action in countries where traces of democracy survive, pacifism can act more effectively against democracy than for it. Objectively the pacifist is pro-Nazi.","If one harbours anywhere in one\'s mind a nationalistic loyalty or hatred, certain facts, although in a sense known to be true, are inadmissible.","Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop. Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain there are no heroes.","A sahib has got to act like a sahib; he has got to appear resolute, to know his own mind and do definite things.","Enlightened people seldom or never possess a sense of responsibility.","As I write, highly civilized human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill me. They do not feel any enmity against me as an individual, nor I against them. They are only \'doing their duty\'","If you have embraced a creed which appears to be free from the ordinary dirtiness of politics - a creed from which you yourself cannot expect to draw any material advantage - surely that proves that you are in the right?","Politically, Swift was one of those people who are driven into a sort of perverse Toryism by the follies of the progressive party of the moment.","Progress and reaction have both turned out to be swindles. Seemingly, there is nothing left but quietism - robbing reality of its terrors by simply submitting to it.","It reminded us that propaganda in some form or other lurks in every book, that every work of art has a meaning and a purpose - a political, social and religious purpose - that our aesthetic judgements are always coloured by our prejudices and beliefs","History has to move in a certain direction, even if it has to be pushed that way by neurotics.","The educated man pictures a horde of submen, wanting only a day\'s liberty to loot his house, burn his books, and set him to work minding a machine or sweeping out a lavatory. \'Anything,\' he thinks, \'any injustice, sooner than let that mob loose.\' He does not see that since there is no difference between the mass of rich and poor, there is no question of setting the mob loose. The mob is in fact loose now, and--in the shape of rich men--is using its power to set up enormous treadmills of boredom, such as \'smart\' hotels.","Manchester is the belly and guts of the nation","To write or even speak English is not a science but an art. There are no reliable words.... Whoever writes English is involved in a struggle that never lets up even for a sentence.","Even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold.","\\"A minority of one\\"... the definition of insanity.","You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable.","The slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.","...men can only be highly civilized while other men, inevitably less civilized, are there to guard and feed them.","Within certain limits, it is actually true that the less money you have, the less you worry.","Tea is one of the main stays of civilization in this country.","The great enemy of clear language is insincerity.","It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing yourself at last genuinely down and out. You have talked so often of going to the dogs - and well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand it. It takes off a lot of anxiety.","But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.","Good writing is like a windowpane.","A tragic situation exists precisely when virtue does not triumph but when it is still felt that man is nobler than the forces which destroy him.","A family with the wrong members in control; that, perhaps, is as near as one can come to describing England in a phrase.","A man who gives a good account of himself is probably lying, since any life when viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats.","To an ordinary human being, love means nothing if it does not mean loving some people more than others.","In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.","Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble.","England will still be England, an everlasting animal, stretching into the future and the past and like all living things having the power to change out of all recognition and yet remain the same.",". . . it is a corrupting thing to live one\'s real life in secret. One should live with the stream of life, not against it.","Recently I was reading somewhere or other  an Italian curio-dealer who attempted to sell a 17th century crucifix to J.P. Morgan. Inside it was concealed a stiletto. What a perfect symbol of the Christian religion.","When you make love you\'re using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy and don\'t give a damn for anything. They can\'t bear you to feel like that. They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. If you\'re happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother and the Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?","Anyone who knows of a provable instance of colour discrimination ought always to expose it.","Huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English russophiles.","The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one is sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of fastening one\'s love upon other human individuals.","To die hating them, that was freedom.","There is only one way to make money at writing, and that is to marry a publisher\'s daughter.","We do not merely destroy our enemies; we change them.","Dickens is one of those authors who are well worth stealing.","...the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war.","In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning.","Sanity was statistical. It was merely a question of learning to think as they thought.","The idea really came to me the day I got my new false teeth.","The Communism of the English intellectual is something explicable enough. It is the patriotism of the deracinated.","Four legs good, two legs bad.","Her feelings were her own, and could not be altered from outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love.","You would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity.","The intellectual is different from the ordinary man, but only in certain sections of his personality, and even then not all the time.","An earthquake is such fun when it is over.","Not to expose your true feelings to an adult seems to be instinctive from the age of seven or eight onwards.","Good novels are not written by orthodoxy-sniffers, nor by people who are conscience-stricken about their own orthodoxy. Good novels are written by people who are not frightened.","It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but always against one\u2019s own body... On the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.","He thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed.","Roughly speaking, the more one pays for food, the more sweat and spittle one is obliged to eat with it.... Dirtiness is inherent in hotels and restaurants, because sound food is sacrificed to punctuality and smartness.","Human beings were behaving as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine.","It was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of opposing it. Nothing had changed except your own attitude: the predestined thing happened in any case.","It had become usual to give Napoleon the Credit for every Successful achievement and every stroke of good fortune. You would often hear one hen remark to another, \\"Under the guidance of our leader, Comrade Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days\\" or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would exclaim, \\"thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!\\".","High sentiments always win in the end. The leaders who offer blood, toil, tears and sweat always get more out of their followers than those who offer safety and a good time. When it comes to the pinch, human beings are heroic.","All men are enemies. All animals are comrades","Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves.","Money has become the grand test of virtue. By this test beggars fail, and for this they are despised. If one could earn even ten pounds a week at begging, it would become a respectable profession immediately. A beggar, looked at realistically, is simply a businessman, getting his living, like other businessmen, in the way that comes to hand. He has not, more than most modem people, sold his honour; he has merely made the mistake of choosing a trade at which it is impossible to grow rich.","In any form of art designed to appeal to large numbers of people,...[t]he rich man is usually \'bad\', and his machinations are invariably frustrated.:; \'Good poor man defeats bad rich man\' is an accepted formula.","War is a way of shattering to pieces... materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and... too intelligent.","Political chaos is connected with the decay of language... one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end.","Probably the best nonsense poetry is produced gradually and accidentally, by communities rather than by individuals.","Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one.","All political thinking for years past has been vitiated in the same way. People can foresee the future only when it coincides with their own wishes, and the most grossly obvious facts can be ignored when they are unwelcome.","Literature is doomed if liberty of thought perishes.","Imperialism as he [Kipling] sees it is a sort of forcible evangelising.","Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent, but the tests that have to be applied to them are not, of course, the same in all cases.","How could you communicate with the future? It was impossible. Either the future would resemble the present in which case it would not listen to him, or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless.","The consequences of every act are included in the act itself.","In a town like London there are always plenty of not quite certifiable lunatics walking the streets, and they tend to gravitate towards bookshops, because a bookshop is one of the few places where you can hang about for a long time without spending any money.","Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your nervous system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom.","Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.","The pleasures of spring are available to everybody and cost nothing.","Using the word \u2018political\u2019 in the widest possible sense. Desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter other peoples\u2019 idea of the kind of society that they should strive after. Once again, no book is genuinely free from political bias. The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.","For the ordinary man is passive. Within a narrow circle (home life, and perhaps the trade unions or local politics) he feels himself master of his fate, but against major events he is as helpless as against the elements. So far from endeavoring to influence the future, he simply lies down and lets things happen to him.","The ruling power is always faced with the question, \u2018In such and such circumstances, what would you do?\u2019, whereas the opposition is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions.","The four great motives for writing prose are sheer egoism, esthetic enthusiasm, historical impulse, and political purpose.","Advertising is the rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket.","He [Gandhi] was not one of those saints who are marked out by their phenomenal piety from childhood onwards, nor one of the other kind who forsake the world after sensational debaucheries.","I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don\'t want virtue to exist anywhere. I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones.","In general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane.","Whatever is funny is subversive, every joke is ultimately a custard pie... a dirty joke is a sort of mental rebellion.","Part of the reason for the ugliness of adults, in a child\'s eyes, is that the child is usually looking upwards, and few faces are at their best when seen from below.","Several of them would have protested if they could have found the right arguments.","The birds sang, the proles sang. the Party did not sing. All round the world, in London and New York, in Africa and Brazil, and in the mysterious, forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the villages of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and Japan \u2014 everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrous by work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death and still singing.","Some things ARE true, even though the party says they are true.","To a surprising extent the war-lords in shining armour, the apostles of martial virtues, tend not to die fighting when time comes. History is full of ignominious getaways by the great and famous.","When you meet anyone in the flesh you realize immediately that he is a human being and not a sort of caricature embodying certain ideas. It is partly for this reason that I don\'t mix much in literary circles, because I know from experience that once I have met and spoken to anyone I shall never again be able to feel any intellectual brutality towards him, even when I feel I ought to - like the Labour M.P.s who get patted on the back by dukes and are lost forever more.","She\'s beautiful,\' he murmured. \'She\'s a metre across the hips, easily,\' said Julia. \'That is her style of beauty,\' said Winston.","The very word \'war\', therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. ... War is Peace.","I am struck again by the fact that as soon as a working man gets an official post in the Trade Union or goes into Labour politics, he becomes middle-class whether he will or no. ie. by fighting against the bourgeoisie he becomes a bourgeois. The fact is that you cannot help living in the manner appropriate and developing the ideology appropriate to your income.","There is a minority of gifted, willfuf people who are determined to live their own lives to the end, and writers belong in this class.","In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptible to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connection to mention the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, \\"just to keep the people frightened.\\"","To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone\u2014 to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone: From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of doublethink \u2014 greetings!","Before the war, and especially before the Boer War, it was summer all the year round.","They clich\xe9s will construct your sentences for you - even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent - and at need they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself.","I had the lonely child\'s habit of making up stories and holding conversations with imaginary persons, and I think from the very start my literary ambitions were mixed up with the feeling of being isolated and undervalued. I knew that I had a facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts, and I felt that this created a sort of private world in which I could get my own back for my failure in everyday life.","I am well acquainted with all the arguments against freedom of thought and speech - the arguments which claim that it cannot exist, and the arguments which claim that it ought not to. I answer simply that they don\'t convince me and that our civilization over a period of four hundred years has been founded on the opposite notice.","War is war. The only good human being is a dead one.","The moralist and the revolutionary are constantly undermining one another. Marx exploded a hundred tons of dynamite beneath the moralist position, and we are still living in the echo of that tremendous crash. But already, somewhere or other, the sappers are at work and fresh dynamite is being tamped in place to blow Marx at the moon. Then Marx, or somebody like him, will come back with yet more dynamite, and so the process continues, to an end we cannot foresee.","Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout Major\'s speech without listening to a word of what he was saying.","Some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial","Sanity is not statistical.","Poverty frees them from ordinary standards of behaviour, just as money frees people from work.","Modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug. The attraction of this way of writing is that it is easy.","War is evil, but it is often the lesser evil.","To walk through the ruined cities of Germany is to feel an actual doubt about the continuity of civilization.","The atmosphere of orthodoxy is always damaging to prose, and above all it is completely ruinous to the novel, the most anarchical of all forms of literature.","The artist is to be exempt from the moral laws that are binding on ordinary people. Just pronounce the magic word \\"Art,\\" and everything is O.K. Rotting corpses with snails crawling over them are O.K.; kicking little girls in the head is O.K.; even a film like L\'Age d\'Or is O.K.","At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question.","In so far as it takes effect at all, pacifist propaganda can only be effective against those countries where a certain amount of freedom of speech is still permitted; in other words it is helpful to totalitarianism.","There is no such thing as a naval dictatorship.","We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there is no knowing.","It\'s a wonderful feeling to have a niece like you \\nBecause you are always so dear\\nYou are so dear no matter the year\\nBut all throughout each day of the year \\nThere could hardly be a town in the South of England where you\\ncould throw a brick without hitting the niece of a bishop.","All human relationships must be purchased with money.","Men are only as good as their technical development allows them to be.","In the nineteenth century some parts of the world were unexplored, but there was almost no restriction on travel.:; Up to 1914 you did not need a passport for any country except Russia.:; The European emigrant, if he could scrape together a few pounds for the passage, simply set sail for America or Australia, and when he got there no questions were asked.:; In the eighteenth century it had been quite normal and safe to travel in a country with which your own country was at war.","The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth.","England is the most class-ridden country under the sun. It is a land of snobbery and privilege, ruled largely by the old and silly.","As I write, highly civilized human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill me.","Scientific education for the masses will do little good, and probably a lot of harm, if it simply boils down to more physics, more chemistry, more biology, etc to the detriment of literature and history. Its probable effect on the average human being would be to narrow the range of his thoughts and make him more than ever contemptuous of such knowledge as he did not possess.","All people who have reached the point of becoming nations tend to despise foreigners, but there is not much doubt that the English-speaking races are the worst offenders. One can see this from the fact that as soon as they become fully aware of any foreign race they invent an insulting nickname for it.","But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.","What is to be expected of them is not treachery, or physcial cowardice, but stupidity, unconscious sabotage, an infallible instinct for doing the wrong thing.","Revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert and know how to chuck out their leaders as soon as the latter have done their job.","The Seven Commandments: Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. No animal shall wear clothes. No animal shall sleep in a bed. No animal shall drink alcohol. No animal shall kill any other animal. All animals are equal.","A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance, this new version is the past and no different past can ever have existed. In principle the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects and its object is not the victory over either Eurasia or East Asia but to keep the very structure of society intact.","The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking - not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.","During part of 1941 and 1942, when the Luftwaffe was busy in Russia, the German radio regaled its home audience with stories of devastating air raids on London. Now, we are aware that those raids did not happen. But what use would our knowledge be if the Germans conquered Britain? For the purpose of a future historian, did those raids happen, or didn\'t they? The answer is: If Hitler survives, they happened, and if he falls they didn\'t happen.","A dirty joke is not, of course, a serious attack on morality, but it is a sort of mental rebellion, a momentary wish that things were otherwise.","Power is not a means; it is an end.","Many people genuinely do not wish to be saints, and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human beings. If one could follow it to its psychological roots, one would, I believe, find that the main motive for \\"non-attachment\\" is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work.","Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull. ","I\'m fat, but I\'m thin inside. Has it ever struck you that there\'s a thin man inside every fat man, just as they say there\'s a statue inside every block of stone?","I loathed the game, and since I could see no pleasure or usefulness in it, it was very difficult for me to show courage at it. Football, it seemed to me, is not really played for the pleasure of kicking a ball about, but is a species of fighting.","In Moulmein, in lower Burma, I was hated by large numbers of people - the only time in my life that I have been important enough for this to happen to me.","Never have ideas about children, and never have ideas for them.","No one I met at this time -- doctors, nurses, practicantes, or fellow-patients -- failed to assure me that a man who is hit through the neck and survives it is the luckiest creature alive. I could not help thinking that it would be even luckier not to be hit at all.","She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wildrose beauty, and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been laundering, scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, over thirty years. At the end of it she was still singing.","Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than ribbons?","From the proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is.","For, when you are approaching poverty, you make one discovery which outweighs some of the others. You discover boredom and mean complications and the beginnings of hunger, but you also discover the great redeeming feature of poverty: the fact that it annihilates the future. Within certain limits, it is actually true that the less money you have, the less you worry.","Society has always seemed to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice.","Napoleon is always right.","He loved Big Brother.","Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invaria.","They were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself","It is brought home to you...that it is only because miners sweat their guts out that superior persons can remain superior.","By the time you have perfected any style of writing, you have always outgrown it.","Ignorance and prejudice are the ballast of our ship of state - however, ships without ballast are not seaworthy and cannot sail in the tempests, nor reach a safe harbor.","He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights. \'White to play and mate in two moves.\' Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White always mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm power. White always mates.","It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-ridden. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already.","For the future. For the unborn.","In my opinion nothing has contributed more to the corruption of the original idea of socialism as the belief that Russia is a socialist country.","Perhaps it is only when people are somewhere near the starvation level that they have anything to sing about.","The most stirring battle-poem in English is about a brigade of cavalry which charged in the wrong direction.","He was alone. The past was dead, the future was unimaginable.","Snobbishness, like hypocrisy, is a check upon behaviour whose value from a social point of view has been underrated.","The citizen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense. Actually, the three philosophies are barely distinguishable.","Winston was gelatinous with fatigue.","No man should be allowed to be the President who does not understand hogs, or hasn\'t been around a manure pile.","The mass of the rich and the poor are differentiated by their incomes and nothing else,and the average millionaire is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit.","Every life viewed from the inside is a series of defeats.","But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this. There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power. Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern.","During the first two months of the war it was the Anarchists more than anyone else who had saved the situation, and much later than this the Anarchist militia, in spite of their indiscipline, were notoriously the best fighters among the purely Spanish forces.","You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one.","The more men you\'ve had, the more I love you.","The Paris slums are a gathering-place for eccentric people - people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent. Poverty frees them from ordinary standards of behavior, just as money frees people from work.","Power-worship blurs political judgment because it leads, almost unavoidably, to the belief that present trends will continue. Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible.","Hunger reduces one to an utterly spineless, brainless condition, more like the after-effects of influenza than anything else. It is as though all one\'s blood had been pumped out and lukewarm water substituted.","The clock struck half past two. In the little office at the back of Mr. McKechnie\'s bookshop, Gordon--Gordon Comstock, last member of the Comstock family, aged twenty-nine and rather moth-eaten already--lounged across the table, pushing a fourpenny packet of Player\'s Weights open and shut with his thumb.","If there really is such a thing as turning in one\'s grave, Shakespeare must get a lot of exercise.","The result of this is that so-called peace propaganda is just as dishonest and intellectually disgusting as war propaganda. Like war propaganda, it concentrates on putting forward a \u2018case\u2019, obscuring the opponent\u2019s point of view and avoiding awkward questions.","There exists a huge dump of worn-out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves.","International football is the continuation of war by other means.","During five literary generations every enlightened person had despised him, and at the end of that time nine-tenths of those enlightened persons are forgotten and Kipling is in some sense still there.","Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the Earth goes round the Sun; today, to believe the past is inalterable. He might be alone in holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him; the horror was that he might also be wrong.","The mistake you make, don\'t you see,is in thinking one can live in a corrupt society without being corrupt oneself. After all, what do you achieve by refusing to make money? You\'re trying to behave as though one could stand right outside our economic system. But one can\'t. One\'s got to change the system, or one changes nothing. One can\'t put things right in a hole-and-corner way, if you take my meaning.","The food crank is by definition a person willing to cut himself off from human society in the hopes of adding five years onto the life of his carcase; that is, a person out of touch with common humanity.","they say that time heals all things, they say you can always forget; but the smiles and the tears across the years they twist my heart strings yet!","Cricket is a game full or forlorn hopes and sudden dramatic changes of fortune and its rules are so ill-defined that their interpretation is partly an ethical business.","In places this book is a little over-written, because Mr Blunden is no more able to resist a quotation than some people are to refuse a drink.","The major problem of our time is the decay in the belief in personal immortality, and it cannot be dealt with while the average human being is either drudging like an ox or shivering in fear of the secret police... How right [the working classes] are to realize that the belly comes before the soul, not in the scale of values but in point of time!","... ages in which the dominant weapon is expensive or difficult to make will tend to be ages of despotism, whereas when the dominant weapon is cheap and simple, the common people have a chance... A complex weapon makes the strong stronger, while a simple weapon -- so long as there is no answer to it -- gives claws to the weak.","How could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?","[Political] prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house.","I would sooner be a foreigner in Spain than in most countries. How easy it is to make friends in Spain!","My best fishing-memory is about some fish that I never caught.","The hospital is the antechamber to the tomb","To do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak: ownlife.","There were sins that were too subtle to be explained, and there were others that were too terrible to be clearly mentioned. For example, there was sex, which was always smouldering just under the surface and which suddenly blew up into a tremendous row when I was about twelve.","He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose, talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary?","I think I exist,\' he said wearily. \'I am conscious of my own identity. I was born, and I shall die. I have arms and legs. I occupy a particular point in space. No other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously.","Joyce is a poet and also an elephantine pedant.","Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me--","People simply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten. You were abolished, annihilated: vaporized was the usual word.","it was only a hopeless fantasy, it passed like an april day, but a look and a word and the dreams they stirred they have stolen my heart away.","Only old Benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been, nor ever could be much better or much worse--hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life.","As a rule they will refuse even to sample a foreign dish, they regard such things as garlic and olive oil with disgust, life is unliveable to them unless they have tea and puddings.","What can the England of 1940 have in common with the England of 1840? But then, what have you in common with the child of five whose photograph your mother keeps on the mantelpiece? Nothing, except that you happen to be the same person.","It is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one\'s own personality. Good prose is like a windowpane.","The object of powder is powder.","The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labor.","Pessimism is reactionary because it makes the very idea of improving the world impossible.","When it comes to the pinch, human beings are heroic.","The fight against bad English is not frivolous.","Winston Churchill could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war.","[You write out of the] desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, etc., etc., etc. It is humbug to pretend this is not a motive and a strong one.","I\'m fat, but I\'m thin inside... there\'s a thin man inside every fat man.","The Catholic and the Communist are alike in assuming that an opponent cannot be both honest and intelligent.","Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase in pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop.","Envy is a horrible thing. It is unlike all other kinds of suffering in that there is no disguising it, no elevating it into tragedy. It is more than merely painful, it is disgusting.","Prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally thankless, irritating and exhausting job. It not only involves praising trash but constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feeling whatever.","There is no test of literary merit except survival, which is itself an index to majority opinion.","It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another.","On each landing, opposite the lift shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.","Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration: so that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional [or scholarly] writers.","Until one has some kind of professional relationship with books, one does not discover how bad the majority of them are.","The men who were well enough to stand had moved across the carriage to cheer the Italians as they went past. A crutch waved out of the window; bandaged forearms made the Red Salute. It was like an allegorical picture of war; the trainload of fresh men gliding proudly up the line, the maimed men sliding slowly down, and all the while the guns on the open trucks making one\'s heart leap as guns always do, and reviving that pernicious feeling, so difficult to get rid of, that war *is* glorious after all.","Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on--that is, badly.","Happiness can only exist in acceptance.","I have no wish to take life, not even human life","[...] you can get anything in this world if you genuinely don\'t want it.","You asked me once,\' said O\'Brien, \'what was in Room 101. I told you that you knew the answer already. Everyone knows it. The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world.","From a very early age, perhaps the age of five or six, I knew that when I grew up I should be a writer. Between the ages of about seventeen and twenty-four I tried to abandon this idea, but I did so with the consciousness that I was outraging my true nature and that sooner or later I should have to settle down and write books.","Mrs Weaver nosed among the books, too dim-witted to grasp that they were in alphabetical order.","Gordon eyed them with inert hatred. At this moment he hated all books, and novels most of all. Horrible to think of all that soggy, half-baked trash massed together in one place.","I had been in London innumerable times, and yet till that day I had never noticed one of the worst things about London-the fact that it costs money even to sit down.","He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the gin.","There is hardly such a thing as a war in which it makes no difference who wins. Nearly always one side stands more of less for progress, the other side more or less for reaction.","I managed to get my copy of Ulysses through safely this time. I rather wish I had never read it. It gives me an inferiority complex. When I read a book like that and then come back to my own work, I feel like a eunuch who has taken a course in voice production.","The organizing principal for any culture is War.","The human beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever.","If you ask any ordinary reader which of Dickens\'s proletarian characters he can remember, the three he is almost certain to mention are Bill Sykes, Sam Weller and Mrs. Gamp. A burglar, a valet and a drunken midwife-not exactly a representative cross-section of the English working class.","Four legs gooood, two legs baaad!","Surely, comrades, you don\'t want Jones back?","He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear.","Why should be fruit be held inferior to the flower?","Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered?","they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes.","The whole experience of being hit by a bullet is very interesting and I think worth describing in detail.","Reality is inside the skull.","Sometimes they threaten you with something - something you can\'t stand up to, can\'t even think about. And then you say, Don\'t do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it to So-and-so. And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn\'t mean it. But that isn\'t true. At the time when it happens you do mean it. You think there\'s no other way of saving yourself, and you\'re quite ready to save yourself that way. You WANT it to happen to the other person. You don\'t give a damn what they suffer. All you care is yourself.","The existence of good bad literature\u2014the fact that one can be amused or excited or even moved by a book that one\'s intellect simply refuses to take seriously\u2014is a reminder that art is not the same thing as cerebration.","A scrupulous writer in every sentence that he writes will ask himself. . . What am I trying to say? What words will express it?...And he probably asks himself. . . Could I put it more shortly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing open your mind and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. They will construct your sentences for you","I did try very hard to tell the whole truth without violating my literary instincts.","By revolution we become more ourselves, not less.","It [England] is a family in which the young are generally thwarted and most of the power is in the hands of irresponsible uncles and bedridden aunts.","Money, money, all is money! Could you write even a penny novelette without money to put heart in you?","All through my boyhood I had a profound conviction that I was no good, that I was wasting my time, wrecking my talents, behaving with monstrous folly and wickedness and ingratitude-and all this, it seemed, was inescapable, because I lived among laws which were absolute, like the law of gravity, but which it was not possible for me to keep.","One wants to live, of course, indeed one only stays alive by virtue of the fear of death.","Man is the only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished forever.","Except for the small revolutionary groups which exist in all countries, the whole world was determined upon preventing revolution in Spain. In particular the Communist Party, with Soviet Russia behind it, had thrown its whole weight against the revolution. It was the Communist thesis that revolution at this stage would be fatal and that what was to be aimed at in Spain was not workers\' control, but bourgeois democracy. It hardly needs pointing out why \'liberal\' capitalist opinion took the same line.","The cheaper books become, the less money is spent on books.","Is not anyone with any degree of mental honesty conscious of telling lies all day long, both in talking and writing, simply because lies will fall into artistic shape when truth will not?","The only imaginative prose writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past.","A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, but then fail all the more completely because he drinks.","The past is a curious thing. It\'s with you all the time. I suppose an hour never passes without your thinking of things that happened ten or twenty years ago, and yet most of the time it\'s got no reality, it\'s just a set of facts that you\'ve learned, like a lot of stuff in a history book. Then some chance sight or sound or smell, especially smell, sets you going, and the past doesn\'t merely come back to you, you\'re actually IN the past. It was like that at this moment.","We were once told that the aeroplane had \\"abolished frontiers\\"; actually it is only since the aeroplane became a serious weapon that frontiers have become definitely impassable.","Most revolutionaries are potential Tories, because they imagine that everything can be put right by altering the shape of society; once that change is effected, as it sometimes is, they see no need for any other.","You must have seen great changes since you were a young man,\\" said Winston tentatively. The old man\'s pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and from the bar to the door of the Gents ... \\"The beer was better,\\" he said finally. \\"And cheaper! When I was a young man, mild beer - wallop we used to call it - was fourpence a pint. That was before the war, of course.\\" \\"Which war was that?\\" said Winston. \\"It\'s all wars,\\" said the old man vaguely. He took up his glass, and his shoulders straightened again. \\"\'Ere\'s wishing you the very best of \'ealth!","I am afraid of death. You are young, so presumably you\'re more afraid of it than I am. Obviously we shall put if off as long as we can. But it makes very little difference. So long as human beings stay human, death and life are the same thing.","The Penguin books are splendid value for sixpence, so splendid that if other publishers had any sense they would combine against them and suppress them.","The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand.","But the thing that I saw in your face no power can disinherit: No bomb that ever burst shatters the crystal spirit.","He had moved from thought to words, and now from words to actions.","Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.","And it is a great thing to die in your own bed, though it is better still to die in your boots.","There were times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking. But there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence.","Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it.","The ideal set up by the Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering-a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons-a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting-three hundred million people all with the same face.","All writers are vain, selfish and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives lies a mystery.","Football, a game in which everyone gets hurt and every nation has its own style of play which seems unfair to foreigners.","Weakness is strength.","The animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be. Every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out to them by a grudging master.","Antisemitism, for instance, is simply not the doctrine of a grown-up person.","One always abandons something in retreat. Look at Napoleon at the Beresina! He abandoned his whole army.","The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity.","Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible.","I have the most evil memories of Spain, but I have very few bad memories of Spaniards.","Do you know why you\u2019re here? Shall I tell you why we brought you here? To cure you.To make you sane.","On a ruinous wall I came upon a poster dating from the previous year and announcing that \u2018six handsome bulls\u2019 would be killed in the arena on such and such a date. How forlorn its faded colours looked. Where were the handsome bulls and the handsome bull-fighters now? It appeared that even in Barcelona there were hardly any bullfights nowadays - for some reason all the best matadors were Fascists.","Between pigs and human beings there was not and there need not be any clash of interest whatsoever.","Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal.","There is a geographical element in all belief-saying what seem profound truths in India have a way of seeming enormous platitudes in England, and vice versa . Perhaps the fundamental difference is that beneath a tropical sun individuality seems less distinct and the loss of it less important.","We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there is no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act collectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generation after generation. In the face of the Thought Police there is no other way.","Take pleasure in the impact of one sound on another.","If he thinks he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously think I see him do it, then the thing happens.","The one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment.","To accept an unorthodoxy is always to inherit unresolved contradictions","We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now.","The child thinks of growing old as an almost obscene calamity, which for some mysterious reason will never happen to itself. All who have passed the age of thirty are joyless grotesques, endlessly fussing about things of no importance and staying alive without, so far as the child can see, having anything to live for. Only child life is real life.","It struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the party was trying to achieve.","A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war.","If you set yourself to it, you can live the same life, rich or poor. You can keep on with your books and your ideas. You just got to say to yourself, \\"I\'m a free man in here\\" - he tapped his forehead - \\"and you\'re all right.","Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.","The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism.","For after all, what is there behind, except money? Money for the right kind of education, money for influential friends, money for leisure and peace of mind, money for trips to Italy. Money writes books, money sells them. Give me not righteousness, O lord, give me money, only money.","It had never occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing, then hardened, roughened by work til it was coarse in the grain like an overripe turnip, could be beautiful. But is was so, and after all, he thought, why not?","Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me: There lie they, and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree.","The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.","I often wondered whether any of the others grasped that I had done it solely to avoid looking a fool.","It was not the man\'s brain that was speaking; it was his larynx.","Records told the same tale, then the lie passed into history and became truth.","There, comrades, is the answer to all our problems. It is summed up in a single word-- Man","The cat joined the Re-education Committee and was very active in it for some days. She was seen one dag sitting on a roof and talking to some sparrows who were just out of her reach. She was telling them that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow who chose could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept their distance.","The paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was Julia\'s life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.","A plongeur is a slave, and a wasted slave, doing stupid and largely unnecessary work. He is kept at work, ultimately, because of a vague feeling that he would be dangerous if he had leisure. And educated people, who should be on his side, acquiesce in the process, because they know nothing about him and consequently are afraid of him.","And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered?","Looking at the world as a whole, the drift for many decades has been not towards anarchy but towards the reimposition of slavery. We may be heading not for general breakdown but for an epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity.","It was soon noticed that when ever there was work to be done the cat could never be found.","Bombing is not especially inhumane. War itself is inhumane and the bombing plane, which is used to paralyse industry and transport, is a relatively civilised weapon. \'Normal\' or \'legitimate\' warfare is just as destructive of inanimate objects and enormously so of human lives.","Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness.","You were the dead; theirs was the future.","He would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies.","I do not think one can assess a writer\'s motives without knowing something of his early development. His subject matter will be determined by the age he lives in ... but before he ever begins to write he will have acquired an emotional attitude from which he will never completely escape.","Most people get a fair amount of fun out of their lives, but on balance life is suffering, and only the very young or the very foolish imagine otherwise.","What was happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years ago. The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second had been the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words, and now from words to actions. The last step was something that would happen in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was contained in the beginning.","Has it ever occurred to you,\' he said, \'that the whole history of English poetry has been de-termined by the fact that the English language lacks rhymes?","How right the working classes are in their \\"materialism.\\" How right they are to realize that the belly comes before the soul, not in the scale of values but in point of time!","...every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all failures.","Processions, meetings, military parades, lectures, waxwork displays, film shows, telescreen programs all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies built, slogans coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs faked.","The end was contained in the beginning.","It is difficult for a statesman who still has a political future to reveal everything that he knows: and in a profession in which one is a baby at 50 and middle-aged at seventy-five, it is natural that anyone who has not actually been disgraced should feel that he still has a future.","...the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.","So long as human beings stay human, death and life are the same thing.","Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows.","It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together. He had time to learn every detail of her hand.","[T]he outcry against killing women, if you accept killing at all, is sheer sentimentality.:; Why is it worse to kill a woman than a man?","Probably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there.","... what is peculiar to our own age is the abandonment of the idea that history could be told truthfully.","What happens to you here is forever.","I suppose there is no place in the world where snobbery is quite so ever-present or where it is cultivated in such refined and subtle forms as in an English public school. Here at least one cannot say that English \u2018education\u2019 fails to do its job. You forget your Latin and Greek within a few months of leaving school \u2014 I studied Greek for eight or ten years, and now, at thirty-three, I cannot even repeat the Greek alphabet \u2014 but your snobbishness, unless you persistently root it out like the bindweed it is, sticks by you till your grave.","His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape form her image.","In moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy but always against one\'s own body.","The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare.","A fat man is never so happy as when he is describing himself as \\"robust.","Comrades,\\" he said, \\"here is a point that must be settled. The wild creatures, such as rats and rabbits\u2013are they our friends or our enemies? Let us put it to the vote. I propose this question to the meeting: Are rats comrades?\\" The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majority that rats were comrades. There were only four dissentients, the three dogs and the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on both sides.","What is not hereditary cannot be permanent.","He felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster. He was alone. The past was dead, the future was unimaginable","Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated.","Donkeys live a long time. None of you has ever seen a dead donkey.","Do you remember writing in your diary,\\" he said, \\"that it did not matter whether I was a friend or an enemy, since I was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane.","the mute protest in your own bones","I have tipped waiters, and I have been tipped by waiters.","Writing a novel is agony.","Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could be tracked down by inquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture. But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it ultimately make? They could not alter your feelings, for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.","When it comes to the pinch, human beings are heroic. Women face childbed and the scrubbing brush, revolutionaries keep their mouths shut in the torture chamber, battleships go down with their guns still firing when their decks are awash.","In all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards.","It is a mysterious thing, the loss of faith\u2014as mysterious as faith itself.","No one, at any rate no English writer, has written better about childhood than Dickens. In spite of all the knowledge that has accumulated since, in spite of the fact that children are now comparatively sanely treated, no novelist has shown the same power of entering into the child\'s point of view.","We may be together for another six months\u2014a year\u2014there\u2019s no knowing. At the end we\u2019re certain to be apart. Do you realize how utterly alone we shall be?","There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always\u2014 do not forget this, Winston\u2014 always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face\u2014 forever.","Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war...war had literally been continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil.","Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible.","If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man.","Even the humblest Party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is that a state of war should exist.","In a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act.","Every generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.","If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face\u2014for ever.","Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.","Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.","Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.","Big Brother is Watching You.","Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.","People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.","Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.","On the whole human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time.","The only good human being is a dead one.","You are a slow learner, Winston.\\"\\"How can I help it? How can I help but see what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four.\\"\\"Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane.","Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered.

But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realise that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.","What can you do, thought Winston, against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?","The greatest enemy of clear language is insincerity.","The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.

People seem to feel that there is some essential difference between beggars and ordinary \'working\' men. They are a race apart--outcasts, like criminals and prostitutes. Working men \'work\', beggars do not \'work\'; they are parasites, worthless in their very nature. It is taken for granted that a beggar does not \'earn\' his living, as a bricklayer or a literary critic \'earns\' his. He is a mere social excrescence, tolerated because we live in a humane age, but essentially despicable.Yet if one looks closely one sees that there is no ESSENTIAL difference between a beggar\'s livelihood and that of numberless respectable people. Beggars do not work, it is said; but, then, what is WORK? A navvy works by swinging a pick. An accountant works by adding up figures. A beggar works by standing out of doors in all weathers and getting varicose veins, chronic bronchitis, etc. It is a trade like any other; quite useless, of course--but, then, many reputable trades are quite useless. And as a social type a beggar compares well with scores of others. He is honest compared with the sellers of most patent medicines, high-minded compared with a Sunday newspaper proprietor, amiable compared with a hire-purchase tout--in short, a parasite, but a fairly harmless parasite. He seldom extracts more than a bare living from the community, and, what should justify him according to our ethical ideas, he pays for it over and over in suffering. I do not think there is anything about a beggar that sets him in a different class from other people, or gives most modern men the right to despise him.Then the question arises, Why are beggars despised?--for they are despised, universally. I believe it is for the simple reason that they fail to earn a decent living. In practice nobody cares whether work is useful or useless, productive or parasitic; the sole thing demanded is that it shall be profitable. In all the modem talk about energy, efficiency, social service and the rest of it, what meaning is there except \'Get money, get it legally, and get a lot of it\'? Money has become the grand test of virtue. By this test beggars fail, and for this they are despised. If one could earn even ten pounds a week at begging, it would become a respectable profession immediately. A beggar, looked at realistically, is simply a businessman, getting his living, like other businessmen, in the way that comes to hand. He has not, more than most modem people, sold his honour; he has merely made the mistake of choosing a trade at which it is impossible to grow rich.","\u0644\u0639\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0641\u0647\u0645\u0648\u0647","\u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a , \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0643\u0631 \u062d\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0637\u0644\u064a\u0642\u0627\u064b , \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0632\u0645\u0646 \u064a\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0639\u0646 \u0628\u0639\u0636\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0632\u0644\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0648 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0632\u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0638\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f \u0623\u0645 \u064a\u0645\u062d\u0648 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u062a\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u0648\u0646 . \u0648\u0625\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645 , \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0628\u0647\u064a\u0646 , \u0645\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0633\u062e\u064a\u0646 , \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631 . \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u0644\u0629 , \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 . \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0643\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0632\u062f\u0648\u062c , \u062a\u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u064a !

It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that the hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word \\"war,\\" therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that is exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and has been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three superstates, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed forever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This--although the vast majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense--is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.","Every war when it comes, or before it comes, is represented not as a war but as an act of self-defense against a homicidal maniac. In our time political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. All the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting. Political language...is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidarity to pure wind. War against a foreign country only happens when the moneyed classes think they are going to profit from it. Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self-deception. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. (On the manipulation of language for political ends.) We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men. If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear. In times of universal deceit, telling the truth will be a revolutionary act.","I trust that every animal here appreciates the sacrifice that Comrade Napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon himself. Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! On the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility. No one believes more firmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal.

In the past, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency. So long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other result generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four. Inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of the kind that is practiced today would have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards. While wars could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.","TWO AND TWO MAKES FIVE","As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race. These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to rebellion. If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Major\'s speech. Instead--she did not know why--they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind. She knew that, even as things were, they were far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings. Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon. But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled.","\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0631\u0641 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0644\u060c \u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644 \u062d\u0630\u0627\u0621 \u064a\u062f\u0648\u0633 \u0648\u064a\u062f\u0645\u063a \u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0628\u062f\u064a\u0646.","\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0643\u0627\u0621, \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0635\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0635\u0648\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647.","Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism. Both words are normally used in so vague a way that any definition is liable to be challenged, but one must draw a distinction between them, since two different and even opposing ideas are involved. By \u2018patriotism\u2019 I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.","When the white man turns tyrant, it is his own freedom that he destroys.","One sometimes gets the impression that the mere words \u2018Socialism\u2019 and \u2018Communism\u2019 draw towards them with magnetic force every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, Quaker, \u2018Nature Cure\u2019 quack, pacifist, and feminist in England.","We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there is no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act collectively.We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generation after generation. In the face of the Thought Police there is no other way.","Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers.","Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even, like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman, saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn\'t. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play. When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don\'t want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit \'tasty\'. There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you.","Don\'t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought?... Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?... The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact, there will be no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking-not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.","The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made their living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the Lottery, which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary. Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being nonexistent persons.","He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights.\'White to play and mate in two moves.\'Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White always mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm power. White always mates.","A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: 1. What am I trying to say? 2. What words will express it? 3. What image or idiom will make it clearer? 4. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: 1. Could I put it more shortly? 2. Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. They will construct your sentences for you -- even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent -- and at need they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself.","The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies \\"something not desirable\\"...In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning.","The war is not meant to be won, it is meant to be continuous. Hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance. This new version is the past and no different past can ever have existed. In principle the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects and its object is not the victory over either Eurasia or East Asia, but to keep the very structure of society intact.","In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of unreliable elements.","England is not the jewelled isle of Shakespeare\'s much-quoted message, nor is it the inferno depicted by Dr Goebbels. More than either it resembles a family, a rather stuffy Victorian family, with not many black sheep in it but with all its cupboards bursting with skeletons. It has rich relations who have to be kow-towed to and poor relations who are horribly sat upon, and there is a deep conspiracy of silence about the source of the family income. It is a family in which the young are generally thwarted and most of the power is in the hands of irresponsible uncles and bedridden aunts. Still, it is a family. It has its private language and its common memories, and at the approach of an enemy it closes its ranks. A family with the wrong members in control - that, perhaps is as near as one can come to describing England in a phrase.","Unpopular ideas can be silenced, and inconvenient facts kept dark, without the need for any official ban. Anyone who has lived long in a foreign country will know of instances of sensational items of news \u2014 things which on their own merits would get the big headlines-being kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that \u2018it wouldn\u2019t do\u2019 to mention that particular fact. So far as the daily newspapers go, this is easy to understand. The British press is extremely centralised, and most of it is owned by wealthy men who have every motive to be dishonest on certain important topics. But the same kind of veiled censorship also operates in books and periodicals, as well as in plays, films and radio. At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question. It is not exactly forbidden to say this, that or the other, but it is \u2018not done\u2019 to say it, just as in mid-Victorian times it was \u2018not done\u2019 to mention trousers in the presence of a lady. Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing, either in the popular press or in the highbrow periodicals.","In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer...","After knowing him I saw the force of the proverb \u2018Trust a snake before a Jew and a Jew before a Greek, but don\u2019t trust an Armenian.","Inequality was the price of civilization.","It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because, being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances.","Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.","What he realised, and more clearly as time went on, was that money-worship has been elevated into a religion. Perhaps it is the only real religion-the only felt religion-that is left to us. Money is what God used to be. Good and evil have no meaning any longer except failure and success. Hence the profoundly significant phrase, to make good. The decalogue has been reduced to two commandments. One for the employers-the elect, the money priesthood as it were- \'Thou shalt make money\'; the other for the employed- the slaves and underlings\'- \'Thou shalt not lose thy job.\' It was about this time that he came across The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists and read about the starving carpenter who pawns everything but sticks to his aspidistra. The aspidistra became a sort of symbol for Gordon after that. The aspidistra, the flower of England! It ought to be on our coat of arms instead of the lion and the unicorn. There will be no revolution in England while there are aspidistras in the windows.","War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking into the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comforable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.","Here one comes upon an all-important English trait: the respect for constituitionalism and legality, the belief in \'the law\' as something above the state and above the individual, something which is cruel and stupid, of course, but at any rate incorruptible.It is not that anyone imagines the law to be just. Everyone knows that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. But no one accepts the implications of this, everyone takes for granted that the law, such as it is, will be respected, and feels a sense of outrage when it is not. Remarks like \'They can\'t run me in; I haven\'t done anything wrong\', or \'They can\'t do that; it\'s against the law\', are part of the atmosphere of England. The professed enemies of society have this feeling as strongly as anyone else. One sees it in prison-books like Wilfred Macartney\'s Walls Have Mouths or Jim Phelan\'s Jail Journey, in the solemn idiocies that take places at the trials of conscientious objectors, in letters to the papers from eminent Marxist professors, pointing out that this or that is a \'miscarriage of British justice\'. Everyone believes in his heart that the law can be, ought to be, and, on the whole, will be impartially administered. The totalitarian idea that there is no such thing as law, there is only power, has never taken root. Even the intelligentsia have only accepted it in theory.An illusion can become a half-truth, a mask can alter the expression of a face. The familiar arguments to the effect that democracy is \'just the same as\' or \'just as bad as\' totalitarianism never take account of this fact. All such arguments boil down to saying that half a loaf is the same as no bread. In England such concepts as justice, liberty and objective truth are still believed in. They may be illusions, but they are powerful illusions. The belief in them influences conduct,national life is different because of them. In proof of which, look about you. Where are the rubber truncheons, where is the caster oil? The sword is still in the scabbard, and while it stays corruption cannot go beyond a certain point. The English electoral system, for instance, is an all but open fraud. In a dozen obvious ways it is gerrymandered in the interest of the moneyed class. But until some deep change has occurred in the public mind, it cannot become completely corrupt. You do not arrive at the polling booth to find men with revolvers telling you which way to vote, nor are the votes miscounted, nor is there any direct bribery. Even hypocrisy is powerful safeguard. The hanging judge, that evil old man in scarlet robe and horse-hair wig,whom nothing short of dynamite will ever teach what century he is living in, but who will at any rate interpret the law according to the books and will in no circumstances take a money bribe,is one of the symbolic figures of England. He is a symbol of the strange mixture of reality and illusion, democracy and privilege, humbug and decency, the subtle network of compromises, by which the nation keeps itself in its familiar shape.","It is only when you meet someone of a different culture from yourself that you begin to realise what your own beliefs really are.","The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.

through the monstrous scenery of slag-heaps, chimneys, piled scrap-iron, foul canals, paths of cindery mud criss-crossed by the prints of clogs. This was March, but the weather had been horribly cold and everywhere there were mounds of blackened snow. As we moved slowly through the outskirts of the town we passed row after row of little grey slum houses running at right angles to the embankment. At the back of one of the houses a young woman was kneeling on the stones, poking a stick up the leaden waste-pipe which ran from the sink inside and which I suppose was blocked. I had time to see everything about her\u2014her sacking apron, her clumsy clogs, her arms reddened by the cold. She looked up as the train passed, and I was almost near enough to catch her eye. She had a round pale face, the usual exhausted face of the slum girl who is twenty-five and looks forty, thanks to miscarriages and drudgery; and it wore, for the second in which I saw it, the most desolate, hopeless expression I have ever-seen. It struck me then that we are mistaken when we say that \u2018It isn\u2019t the same for them as it would be for us,\u2019 and that people bred in the slums can imagine nothing but the slums. For what I saw in her face was not the ignorant suffering of an animal. She knew well enough what was happening to her\u2014understood as well as I did how dreadful a destiny it was to be kneeling there in the bitter cold, on the slimy stones of a slum backyard, poking a stick up a foul drain-pipe.","\u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0638\u0644\u0645\u0646\u064a, \u0641\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0636\u0639 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a \u0641\u0648\u0642 \u0648\u0631\u0648\u062f \u0646\u0627\u0639\u0645\u0629,\u0641\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0633\u0645\u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0645\u0648\u062c\u0648\u0639","In times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolucionary act.","How could you tell how much of it was lies? It might be true that the average human being was better off now than before the Revolution. The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. It struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for a party member, were neutral and nonpolitical, a matter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering--a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons--a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting--three hundred million people all with the same face.","If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened\u2014that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death.","Quien con\xadtro\xadla el pa\xadsa\xaddo \u2014dec\xeda la con\xadsig\xadna del Par\xadti\xaddo\u2014 con\xadtro\xadla el fu\xadtu\xadro.

With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm. That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time. Winston woke up with the word \u2018Shakespeare\u2019 on his lips.","The aim of the joke is not to degrade the human being, but to remind him that he is already degraded.","If you had asked me why I had joined the militia I should have answered: \'To fight against Fascism,\' and if you had asked me what I was fighting for, I should have answered: \'Common decency.","[Hitler] has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all \u201cprogressive thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security, and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don\u2019t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flag and loyalty-parades ...

It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. Crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity.","Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not money, I am become as a sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not money, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not money, it profiteth me nothing. Money suffereth long, and is kind; money envieth not; money vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. . . . And now abideth faith, hope, money, these three; but the greatest of these is money. I Corinthians xiii (adapted)","At night all cats are grey.","There are books that one reads over and over again, books that become part of the furniture of one\u2019s mind and alter one\u2019s whole attitude to life, books that one dips into but never reads through, books that one reads at a single sitting and forgets a week later:","I have no particular love for the idealized \u201cworker as he appears in the bourgeois Communist\u2019s mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.\u201d","In practice nobody cares if work is useful or useless, productive or parasitic; the sole thing demanded is that it shall be profitable. In all the modern talk about energy, efficiency, social service and the rest of it, what meaning is there except \\" Get money, get it legally, and get a lot of it\\"? Money has become the grand test of virtue. By this test beggars fail, and for this they are despised.","But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation even among people who should and do know better. The debased language that I have been discussing is in some ways very convenient. Phrases like\xa0a not unjustifiable assumption, leaves much to be desired, would serve no good purpose, a consideration which we should do well to bear in mind, are a continuous temptation, a packet of aspirins always at one\'s elbow. Look back through this essay, and for certain you will find that I have again and again committed the very faults I am protesting against. By this morning\'s post I have received a pamphlet dealing with conditions in Germany. The author tells me that he \\"felt impelled\\" to write it. I open it at random, and here is almost the first sentence I see: \\"[The Allies] have an opportunity not only of achieving a radical transformation of Germany\'s social and political structure in such a way as to avoid a nationalistic reaction in Germany itself, but at the same time of laying the foundations of a co-operative and unified Europe.\\" You see, he \\"feels impelled\\" to write -- feels, presumably, that he has something new to say -- and yet his words, like cavalry horses answering the bugle, group themselves automatically into the familiar dreary pattern. This invasion of one\'s mind by ready-made phrases (lay the foundations, achieve a radical transformation) can only be prevented if one is constantly on guard against them, and every such phrase anaesthetizes a portion of one\'s brain.","Comrades,\\" he said, \\"here is a point that must be settled. The wild creatures, such as rats and rabbits\u2013are they our friends or our enemies? Let us put it to the vote. I propose this question to the meeting: Are rats comrades?\\"The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majority that rats were comrades.

In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening.

Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.","They laid me down again while somebody fetched a stretcher. As soon as I knew that the bullet had gone clean through my neck I took it for granted that I was done for. I had never heard of a man or an animal getting a bullet through the middle of the neck and surviving it. The blood was dribbling out of the comer of my mouth. \u2018The artery\'s gone,\u2019 I thought. I wondered how long you last when your carotid artery is cut; not many minutes, presumably. Everything was very blurry. There must have been about two minutes during which I assumed that I was killed. And that too was interesting\u2014I mean it is interesting to know what your thoughts would be at such a time. My first thought, conventionally enough, was for my wife. My second was a violent resentment at having to leave this world which, when all is said and done, suits me so well. I had time to feel this very vividly. The stupid mischance infuriated me. The meaninglessness of it! To be bumped off, not even in battle, but in this stale comer of the trenches, thanks to a moment\'s carelessness! I thought, too, of the man who had shot me\u2014wondered what he was like, whether he was a Spaniard or a foreigner, whether he knew he had got me, and so forth.

And in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years \u2014 imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation of whole populations \u2014 not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive.","\u0633\u0631 \u0623\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0647\u0648 \u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0625\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062e\u0637\u0626 \u0648\u0642\u062f\u0631\u062a\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062e\u0637\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a","He wondered about the people in houses like those. They would be, for example, small clerks, shop-assistants, commercial travellers, insurance touts, tram conductors. Did they know that they were only puppets dancing when money pulled the strings? You bet they didn\u2019t. And if they did, what would they care? They were too busy being born, being married, begetting, working, dying. It mightn\u2019t be a bad thing, if you could manage it, to feel yourself one of them, one of the ruck of men. Our civilization is founded on greed and fear, but in the lives of common men the greed and fear are mysteriously transmuted into something nobler. The lower-middle-class people in there, behind their lace curtains, with their children and their scraps of furniture and their aspidistras \u2014 they lived by the money-code, sure enough, and yet they contrived to keep their decency. The money-code as they interpreted it was not merely cynical and hoggish. They had their standards, their inviolable points of honour. They \u2018kept themselves respectable\u2019\u2014 kept the aspidistra flying. Besides, they were alive. They were bound up in the bundle of life. They begot children, which is what the saints and the soul-savers never by any chance do.The aspidistra is the tree of life, he thought suddenly.","Do not imagine that you will save yourself, however completely you surrender to us. No one who has once gone astray is ever spared. And even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life, still you would never escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever. Understand that in advance. We shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back. Things will happen to you from which you could not recover, if you lived a thousand years. Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling.Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.","And yet the animals never gave up hope. More, they never lost, even for an instant, their sense of honour and privilege in being members of Animal Farm. They were still the only farm in the whole county-in all England!-owned and operated by animals. Not one of them, not even the youngest, not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or twenty miles away, ever ceased to marvel at that. And when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk turned always towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, the writing of the Seven Commandments, the great battles in which the human invaders had been defeated. None of the old dreams had been abandoned. The Republic of the Animals which Major had foretold, when the green fields of England should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed in. Some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it might not be with in the lifetime of any animal now living, but still it was coming. Even the tune of Beasts of England was perhaps hummed secretly here and there: at any rate, it was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, though no one would have dared to sing it aloud. It might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other animals. If they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves. No creature among them went upon two legs. No creature called any other creature \\"Master.\\" All animals were equal.","\u0623\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0651 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0651\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0651\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0636\u064a\u064a\u0642 \u0645\u0646 \u0622\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0643\u064a\u0631\u061f \u0628\u062d\u064a\u062b \u062a\u0635\u0628\u062d \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0643\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0627\u0641 \u062c\u0631\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0633\u062a\u062d\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u0648\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u062d\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0651\u0629\u060c \u0648 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0651\u0647 \u0644\u0646 \u062a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0631\u062a\u0643\u0628 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629. \u0641\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0641\u0647\u0648\u0645 \u064a\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0633\u064a\u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u062f\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0646\u0649 \u0648 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0623\u0648\u064a\u0644\u060c \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0639\u064a\u0651\u0629 \u0641\u0633\u064a\u062a\u0645 \u0637\u0645\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u062a\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0637\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0646 (...) \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a \u062a\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0635 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0639\u0627\u0645\u060c \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0636\u0627\u0621\u0644 \u0645\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0639\u064a \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0643 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u0641\u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b (...) \u0633\u062a\u0628\u0644\u063a \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0648\u062c\u0651\u0647\u0627 \u062d\u064a\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0643\u062a\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u063a\u0629 \u0648 \u064a\u062a\u0645 \u0625\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 (...) \u0645\u0639 \u062d\u0644\u0648\u0644 \u0639\u0627\u0645 2050 \u0623\u0648 \u0631\u0628\u0651\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0630\u0644\u0643\u060c \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0651\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0642\u062f \u062a\u0644\u0627\u0634\u062a\u060c \u0648 \u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0628\u064a \u0642\u062f \u0627\u0646\u062f\u062b\u0631.

There was a direct, intimate connection between chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the hatred, the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch except by bottling down some powerful instinct in using it as a driving force?

What a crew! Think of a programme which at any rate for a while could bring Hitler, Petain, Montagu Norman, Pavelitch, William Randolph Hearst, Streicher, Buchman, Ezra Pound, Juan March, Cocteau, Thyssen, Father Coughlin, the Mufti of Jerusalem, Arnold Lunn, Antonescu, Spengler, Beverley Nichols, Lady Houston, and Marinetti all into the same boat! But the clue is really very simple. They are all people with something to lose, or people who long for a hierarchical society and dread the prospect of a world of free and equal human beings. Behind all the ballyhoo that is talked about \u2018godless\u2019 Russia and the \u2018materialism\u2019 of the working class lies the simple intention of those with money or privileges to cling to them. Ditto, though it contains a partial truth, with all the talk about the worthlessness of social reconstruction not accompanied by a \u2018change of heart\u2019. The pious ones, from the Pope to the yogis of California, are great on the\u2019 change of heart\u2019, much more reassuring from their point of view than a change in the economic system.","I do not think one can assess a writer\'s motives without knowing something of his early development. His subject matter will be determined by the age he lives in... but before he ever begins to write he will have acquired an emotional attitude from which he will never completely escape.

In the general patriotism of the country they form a sort of island of dissident thought. England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings. It is a strange fact, but it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during \u2018God save the King\u2019 than of stealing from a poor box.

This is almost too obvious and too generally admitted to need pointing out. But as a single instance, take taste in its narrowest sense - the taste for decent food. In the highly mechanical countries, thanks to tinned food, cold storage, synthetic flavouring matters, etc., the palate it almost a dead organ. As you can see by looking at any greengrocer\u2019s shop, what the majority of English people mean by an apple is a lump of highly-coloured cotton wool from America or Australia; they will devour these things, apparently with pleasure, and let the English apples rot under the trees. It is the shiny, standardized, machine-made look of the American apple that appeals to them; the superior taste of the English apple is something they simply do not notice. Or look at the factory-made, foil wrapped cheeses and \u2018blended\u2019 butter in an grocer\u2019s; look at the hideous rows of tins which usurp more and more of the space in any food-shop, even a dairy; look at a sixpenny Swiss roll or a twopenny ice-cream; look at the filthy chemical by-product that people will pour down their throats under the name of beer. Wherever you look you will see some slick machine-made article triumphing over the old-fashioned article that still tastes of something other than sawdust. And what applies to food applies also to furniture, houses, clothes, books, amusements and everything else that makes up our environment. These are now millions of people, and they are increasing every year, to whom the blaring of a radio is not only a more acceptable but a more normal background to their thoughts than the lowing of cattle or the song of birds. The mechanisation of the world could never proceed very far while taste, even the taste-buds of the tongue, remained uncorrupted, because in that case most of the products of the machine would be simply unwanted. In a healthy world there would be no demand for tinned food, aspirins, gramophones, gas-pipe chairs, machine guns, daily newspapers, telephones, motor-cars, etc. etc.; and on the other hand there would be a constant demand for the things the machine cannot produce. But meanwhile the machine is here, and its corrupting effects are almost irresistible. One inveighs against it, but one goes on using it. Even a bare-arse savage, given the change, will learn the vices of civilisation within a few months. Mechanisation leads to the decay of taste, the decay of taste leads to demand for machine-made articles and hence to more mechanisation, and so a vicious circle is established.","For if in careless summer daysIn groves of Ashtaroth we whored,Repentant now, when winds blow cold,We kneel before our rightful lord;The lord of all, the money-god,Who rules us blood and hand and brain,Who gives the roof that stops the wind,And, giving, takes away again;Who spies with jealous, watchful care,Our thoughts, our dreams, our secret ways,Who picks our words and cuts our clothes,And maps the pattern of our days;Who chills our anger, curbs our hope,And buys our lives and pays with toys,Who claims as tribute broken faith,Accepted insults, muted joys;Who binds with chains the poet\u2019s wit,The navvy\u2019s strength, the soldier\u2019s pride,And lays the sleek, estranging shieldBetween the lover and his bride.","Nearly all children nowadays were horrible.

Now, when one demands liberty of speech and of the press, one is not demanding absolute liberty. There always must be, or at any rate there always will be, some degree of censorship, so long as organised societies endure. But freedom, as Rosa Luxembourg [sic] said, is \u2018freedom for the other fellow\u2019. The same principle is contained in the famous words of Voltaire: \u2018I detest what you say; I will defend to the death your right to say it.\u2019 If the intellectual liberty which without a doubt has been one of the distinguishing marks of western civilisation means anything at all, it means that everyone shall have the right to say and to print what he believes to be the truth, provided only that it does not harm the rest of the community in some quite unmistakable way.","The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of r\xe9gime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way.","I do not think one can assess a writer\u2019s motives without knowing something of his early development. His subject matter will be determined by the age he lives in ... but before he ever begins to write he will have acquired an emotional attitude from which he will never completely escape.","Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.","But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.

I believe everyone who has been hard up has experienced it. It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing yourself at last genuinely down and out.

The Party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice; at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire. They need only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it.","Life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.","Up there, comrades,\\" he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with his large beak\u2013 \\"up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can see\u2013 there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest for ever from our labours!\\" He even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges. Many of the animals believed him. Their lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and just that a better world should exist somewhere else?","The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already.","He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.","She spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations, distributing literature for the Junior Anti-Sex League, preparing banners for Hate Week, making collections for the savings campaign, and such-like activities. It paid, she said; it was camouflage. If you kept the small rules you could break the big ones.","If you want to know who rules over you, look at who you are not allowed to criticize.","Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.","We are the dead,\' he said.\'We\'re not dead yet,\' said Julia prosaically.\'Not physically. Six months, a year \u2013 five years, conceivably. I am afraid of death. You are young, so presumably you\'re more afraid of it than I am. Obviously we shall put it off as long as we can.

There was hardly a soul in the firm who was not perfectly well aware that publicity - advertising - is the dirtiest ramp that capitalism has yet produced. In the red lead firm there had still lingered certain notions of commercial honour and usefulness. But such things would have been laughed at in the New Albion. Most of the employees were the hard-boiled, Americanized, go-getting type to whom nothing in the world is sacred, except money. They had their cynical code worked out. The public are swine; advertising is the rattling of a stick inside a swill-bucket. And yet beneath their cynicism there was the final naivete, the blind worship of the money-god.","\u0645\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u0634\u0643 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644 \u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0631\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0645\u062b\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0632\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u062a \u060c \u0645\u0648\u0632\u0639\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0632\u064a\u0639\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0628\u064a\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0638\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0635\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0637\u0628\u0642\u0629 \u0642\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u062f \u062a\u062d\u0638\u0649 \u0628\u0627\u0645\u062a\u064a\u0627\u0632\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639\u0627\u064b \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0646\u0639\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u060c \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u062d\u0638\u064a \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0641\u0627\u0647 \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u062e\u062f\u0631\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0631 \u0633\u064a\u063a\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u062b\u0642\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0633\u064a\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0641\u0643\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u0630\u0648\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0645 \u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0641\u0625\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0633\u064a\u0641\u0637\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u0641\u0627\u0626\u062f\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062a\u064a\u0627\u0632\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0633\u064a\u0639\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0625\u0632\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0633\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629","\u0647\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u064a\u0636\u064a\u0642 \u0630\u0631\u0639\u0627 \u0628\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0636\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0637\u0627\u0642 \u0644\u0648 \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u062f\u064a\u0647 \u0630\u0627\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0648\u062d\u064a \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0631 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u062a\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0639\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646\u061f","Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.","...And the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar. It was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found. She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened. But she always made such excellent excuses , and purred so affectionately , that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions.","He was alone with seven thousand books...mostly aged and unsaleable.","From the totalitarian point of view history is something to be created rather than learned. A totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible. But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened. Then again, every major change in policy demands a corresponding change of doctrine and a revelation of prominent historical figures. This kind of thing happens everywhere, but is clearly likelier to lead to outright falsification in societies where only one opinion is permissible at any given moment. Totalitarianism demands, in fact, the continuous alteration of the past, and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth.","The truest happiness, he said, lay in working hard and living frugally.","Tutti gli animali sono uguali, ma alcuni sono pi\xf9 uguali degli altri","The war is not meant to be won. It is meant to be continuous. The essential act of modern warfare is the destruction of the produce of human labour. A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance. In principle, the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects, and its object is not victory over Eurasia or Eastasia, but to keep the very structure of society intact.\\"Julia? Are you awake?

Perhaps society is past praying for, but there is always hope for the individual human being, if you can catch him young enough. This belief partly accounts for Dickens\u2019s preoccupation with childhood.","And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No argument must lead you astray.","It struck me that perhaps a lot of the people you see walking about are dead. We say that a man\'s dead when his heart stops and not before. It seems a bit arbitrary. After all, parts of your body don\'t stop working -hair goes on growing for years, for instance. Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea. Old Porteous is like that. Wonderfully learned, wonderfully good taste - but he\'s not capable of change. Just says the same things and thinks the same thoughts over and over again. There are a lot of people like that. Dead minds, stopped inside. Just keep moving backwards and forwards on the same little track, getting fainter all the time, like ghosts.","The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometer of it. It was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-guns nests.

Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it? And yet-!","Always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler.

One\'s real reaction to a book, when one has a reaction at all, is usually \\"I like this book\\" or \\"I don\'t like it\\" and what follows is a rationalisation.","The food we were given was no more than eatable, but the patron was not mean about drink; he allowed us two litres of wine a day each, knowing that if a plongeur is not given two litres he will steal three.","Never use the passive where you can use the active.","\u0647\u0645 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0648 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0631.","That is her style of beauty.","In trench warfare five things are important: firewood, food, tobacco, candles, and the enemy.

There is a whole series of converging reasons why it is somewhat easier for a poet than a prose writer to feel at home in an authoritarian society.[...]what the poet is saying- that is, what his poem \\"means\\" if translated into prose- is relatively unimportant, even to himself. The thought contained in a poem is always simple, and is no more the primary purpose of the poem than the anecdote is the primary purpose of the picture. A poem is an arrangement of sounds and associations, as a painting is an arrangement of brushmarks.

What Dali has done and what he has imagined is debatable, but in his outlook, his character, the bedrock decency of a human being does not exist. He is as anti-social as a flea. Clearly, such people are undesirable, and a society in which they can flourish has something wrong with it.Now, if you showed this book, with its illustrations, to Lord Elton, to Mr. Alfred Noyes, to The Times leader writers who exult over the \u201ceclipse of the highbrow - in fact, to any \u201csensible\u201d art-hating English person - it is easy to imagine what kind of response you would get. They would flatly refuse to see any merit in Dali whatever. Such people are not only unable to admit that what is morally degraded can be \xe6sthetically right, but their real demand of every artist is that he shall pat them on the back and tell them that thought is unnecessary. And they can be especially dangerous at a time like the present, when the Ministry of Information and the British Council put power into their hands. For their impulse is not only to crush every new talent as it appears, but to castrate the past as well. Witness the renewed highbrow-baiting that is now going on in this country and America, with its outcry not only against Joyce, Proust and Lawrence, but even against T. S. Eliot.But if you talk to the kind of person who can see Dali\u2019s merits, the response that you get is not as a rule very much better. If you say that Dali, though a brilliant draughtsman, is a dirty little scoundrel, you are looked upon as a savage. If you say that you don\u2019t like rotting corpses, and that people who do like rotting corpses are mentally diseased, it is assumed that you lack the \xe6sthetic sense. Since \u201cMannequin rotting in a taxicab\u201d is a good composition. And between these two fallacies there is no middle position, but we seldom hear much about it. On the one side Kulturbolschewismus: on the other (though the phrase itself is out of fashion) \u201cArt for Art\u2019s sake.\u201d Obscenity is a very difficult question to discuss honestly. People are too frightened either of seeming to be shocked or of seeming not to be shocked, to be able to define the relationship between art and morals.It will be seen that what the defenders of Dali are claiming is a kind of benefit of clergy. The artist is to be exempt from the moral laws that are binding on ordinary people. Just pronounce the magic word \u201cArt,\u201d and everything is O.K.\u201d","Who controls the past,\u2019 ran the Party slogan, \u2018controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\u2019 And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered.

A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety, rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces, bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes insufficient -- nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though, of course, it grew worse as one\'s body aged, was it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things, if one\'s heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness of one\'s socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil tastes? Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different?","It was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated.","Political or military commentators, like astrologers, can survive almost any mistake, because their more devoted followers do not look to them for an appraisal of the facts but for the stimulation of nationalistic loyalties","They could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to.

All the while, though I was technically in hiding, I could not feel myself in danger. The whole thing seemed too absurd.

The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not. This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing.

Summer evenings, the fish breaking the water, the nightjars hawking round your head, the smell of nightstocks and latakia. Don\u2019t mistake what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to put across any of that poetry of childhood stuff. I know that\u2019s all baloney. Old Porteous (a friend of mine, a retired schoolmaster, I\u2019ll tell you about him later) is great on the poetry of childhood. Sometimes he reads me stuff about it out of books. Wordsworth. Lucy Gray. There was a time when meadow, grove, and all that. Needless to say he\u2019s got no kids of his own. The truth is that kids aren\u2019t in any way poetic, they\u2019re merely savage little animals, except that no animal is a quarter as selfish.A boy isn\u2019t interested in meadows, groves, and so forth. He never looks at a landscape, doesn\u2019tgive a damn for flowers, and unless they affect him in some way, such as being good to eat, he doesn\u2019t know one plant from another. Killing things - that\u2019s about as near to poetry as a boy gets. And yet all the while there\u2019s that peculiar intensity, the power of longing for things as you can\u2019t long when you\u2019re grown up, and the feeling that time stretches out and out in front of you and that whatever you\u2019re doing you could go on for ever.","It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one\u2019s consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.","I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don\'t want any virtue to exist anywhere. I want everyone corrupt to the bones.\'\'Well then, I ought to suit you, dear. I\'m corrupt to the bones.","... the writer knows more or less what he wants to say, but an accumulation of stale phrases chokes him like tea-leaves blocking a sink.","It struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones.","The notion that you can somehow defeat violence by submitting to it is simply a flight from fact. As I have said, it is only possible to people who have money and guns between themselves and reality.","If [pacifists] imagine that one can somehow \\"overcome\\" the German army by lying on one\'s back, let them go on imagining it, but let them also wonder occasionally whether this is not an illusion due to security, too much money and a simple ignorance of the way in which things actually happen.","Only the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is something objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal.","Looking back through the last page or two, I see that I have made it appear as though my motives in writing were wholly public-spirited. I don\u2019t want to leave that as the final impression. All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand. For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention. And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one\u2019s own personality. Good prose is like a windowpane. I cannot say with certainty which of my motives are the strongest, but I know which of them deserve to be followed. And looking back through my work, I see that it is invariably where I lacked a POLITICAL purpose that I wrote lifeless books and was betrayed into purple passages, sentences without meaning, decorative adjectives and humbug generally.","\u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u062a\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0623\u064a\u0636\u0627 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062e\u0637\u0631\u0629","One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. It was always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be enough. In that time the world inside him could turn over.

Hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! would go the bullet, too late, or too early.

The word has, in fact, moved up in the social scale and ceased to be a swear word for the purposes of the working classes. The current London adjective, now tacked on to every noun, is -----.

Without a free press and the right of assembly, it is impossible not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary. Is there a Gandhi in Russia at this moment? And if there is, what is he accomplishing?","In an age like our own, when the artist is an altogether exceptional person, he must be allowed a certain amount of irresponsibility, just as a pregnant woman is. Still, no one would say that a pregnant woman should be allowed to commit murder, nor would anyone make such a claim for the artist, however gifted. If Shakespeare returned to the earth to-morrow, and if it were found that his favourite recreation was raping little girls in railway carriages, we should not tell him to go ahead with it on the ground that he might write another King Lear. And, after all, the worst crimes are not always the punishable ones. By encouraging necrophilic reveries one probably does quite as much harm as by, say, picking pockets at the races. One ought to be able to hold in one\u2019s head simultaneously the two facts that Dali is a good draughtsman and a disgusting human being. The one does not invalidate or, in a sense, affect the other. The first thing that we demand of a wall is that it shall stand up. If it stands up, it is a good wall, and the question of what purpose it serves is separable from that. And yet even the best wall in the world deserves to be pulled down if it surrounds a concentration camp. In the same way it should be possible to say, \u201cThis is a good book or a good picture, and it ought to be burned by the public hangman. Unless one can say that, at least in imagination, one is shirking the implications of the fact that an artist is also a citizen and a human being.\u201d","The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that there were millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory.","They can\'t get inside you,\' she had said. But they could get inside you.","She knew when to cheer and when to boo, and that was all one needed","The essential point of Nineteen Eighty-Four is just this, the danger of the ultimate and absolute power which mind can develop when it frees itself from conditions, from the bondage of things and history.","The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?","Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.","But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction \u2014 indeed, in some sense was the destruction \u2014 of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction.","In a Society in which there is no law, and in theory no compulsion, the only arbiter of behaviour is public opinion. But public opinion, because of the tremendous urge to conformity in gregarious animals, is less tolerant than any system of law. When human beings are governed by \u2018thou shalt not\u2019, the individual can practise a certain amount of eccentricity: when they are supposedly governed by \u2018love\u2019 or \u2018reason\u2019, he is under continuous pressure to make him behave and think in exactly the same way as everyone else.","Do it to Julia.","We make you pay for the water you drink, for the food you eat, for the wars we need, for the crimes we commit.

We call this freedom.","If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. when the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in her arms. It was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more chocolate, it did net avert the child\'s death or her own; but it seemed natural to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against bullets than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the party has done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. When once you were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel, what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference. Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again. You were lifted clean out of history.","A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement before the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents produced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline. The first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to young children, is called, in Newspeak, CRIMESTOP. CRIMESTOP means the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. CRIMESTOP, in short, means protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one\u2019s own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body.","He disliked nearly all women and especially the young and pretty ones who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party the swallowers of slogans the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy.","It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery, are a continuation of one\u2019s intellectual life, and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake.","The sensitive person\'s hostility to the machine is in one sense unrealistic, because of the obvious fact that the machine has come to stay. But as an attitude of mind there is a great deal to be said for it. The machine has got to be accepted, but it is probably better to accept it rather as one accepts a drug - that is, grudgingly and suspiciously. Like a drug, the machine is useful, dangerous and habit-forming. The oftener one surrenders to it the tighter its grip becomes.","We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end.","The young officers who had come back [from WW1], hardened by their terrible experience and disgusted by the attitude of the younger generation to whom this experience meant just nothing, used to lecture us for our softness. Of course they could produce no argument that we were capable of understanding. They could only bark at you that war was \u2018a good thing\u2019, it \u2018made you tough\u2019, \u2018kept you fit\u2019, etc. etc. We merely sniggered at them. Ours was the one-eyed pacifism that is peculiar to sheltered countries with strong navies.","And in every detail of your life, if no ultimate purpose redeemed it, there was a quality of greyness, of desolation, that could never be described, but which you could feel like a physical pang at your heart. Life, if the grave really ends it, is monstrous and dreadful. No use trying to argue it away. Think of life as it really is, think of the details of life; and then think that there is no meaning in it, no purpose, no goal except the grave. Surely only fools or self-deceivers, or those whose lives are exceptionally fortunate, can face that thought without flinching?","Poverty is spiritual\xa0halitosis.","Is there anyone who has ever written so much as a love letter in which he felt that he had said exactly what he intended? A writer falsifies himself both intentionally and unintentionally. Intentionally, because the accidental qualities of words constantly tempt and frighten him away from his true meaning. He gets an idea, begins trying to express it, and then, in the frightful mess of words that generally results, a pattern begins to form itself more or less accidentally. It is not by any means the pattern he wants, but it is at any rate not vulgar or disagreeable; it is good art. He takes it because good art is a more or less mysterious gift from heaven, and it seems a pity to waste it when it presents itself.","Words are such feeble things.","It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself__anything that carried the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offense. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called.","But though it is unreal, it is not meaningless.","Los altos quieren quedarse donde est\xe1n; los medianos quieren arrebatarle su puesto a los altos; los bajos quieren abolir todas las distinciones y crear una sociedad en la que todos sean iguales.","Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds,","That\'s the way we\'re going nowadays.

So long as I remain alive and well I shall continue to feel strongly about prose style, to love the surface of the earth, to take pleasure in solid objects and scrapes of useless information. It is no use trying to suppress that side of myself.

It is something integral to totalitarianism, something that would still continue even if concentration camps and secret police forces had ceased to be necessary.","I have no particular love for the idealized \u2018worker\u2019 as he appears in the bourgeois Communist\u2019s mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.","\xbfY si el p\xe1sado y el mundo exterior s\xf3lo existen en nuestra mente y, siendo la mente controlable, tambi\xe9n puede controlarse el pasado y lo que llamamos realidad?","But the trouble is that conscious futility is something only for the young. One cannot go on \\"despairing of life\\" in to a ripe old age. One cannot go on being \\"decadent\\", since decadence means falling and one can only said to be falling if one is going to reach the bottom reasonably soon. Sooner or later one is obliged to adopt a positive attitude toward life and society.","Modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug. The attraction of this way of writing is that it is easy. It is easier -- even quicker, once you have the habit -- to say In my opinion it is not an unjustifiable assumption that than to say I think.","The woman at the desk was a university graduate, young, colourless, spectacled, and intensely disagreeable. She had a fixed suspicion that no one \u2014 at least, no male person \u2014 ever consulted works of reference except in search of pornography. As soon as you approached she pierced you through and through with a flash of her pince-nez and let you know that your dirty secret was no secret from HER. After all, all works of reference are pornographical, except perhaps Whitaker\u2019s Almanack.

But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts. The keyword here is BLACKWHITE. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to BELIEVE that black is white, and more, to KNOW that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary.","Political language \u2026 is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one\u2019s own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase \u2013 some jackboot, Achilles\u2019 heel, hotbed, melting pot, acid test, veritable inferno or other lump of verbal refuse \u2013 into the dustbin where it belongs.","There is nothing like an earthquake for drawing people together. One more tremor, or perhaps two, and they would have asked the butler to sit down at table with them.","The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim\u2014for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives\u2014is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters.","Past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in human memories. The past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon.","The violation of the inner person is the greatest territorial crime of all.","He might be alone in holding that belief, and if alone, than a lunatic.

To get out of the money-world\u2014that was what he wanted. Vaguely he looked forward to some kind of moneyless, anchorite existence.

Moreover, in those seven months he wrote practically nothing. The first effect of poverty is that it kills thought. He grasped, as though it were a new discovery, that you do not escape from money merely by being moneyless. On the contrary, you are the hopeless slave of money until you have enough of it to live on\u2014a \u2018competence\u2019, as the beastly middle-class phrase goes.","In Newspeak there is no word for \u2018Science\u2019.

Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless as it refines itself.

Aku yakin alasannya sangat sederhana, yaitu karena mereka gagal hidup layak. Dalam prakteknya, orang tidak peduli apakah suatu pekerjaan itu berguna atau tidak, produktif atau bersifat parasit; satu-satunya hal yang penting adalah bahwa pekerjaan itu harus menguntungkan. Dalam semua perbincangan modern tentang efisiensi, pelayanan sosial dan lain-lain, adakah makna lain selain \'Dapatkan uang, bikin jadi legal, dan dapatkan banyak-banyak\'? Uang sudah menjadi alat ukur utama moralitas. Dengan ukuran ini pengemis gagal, dan karenanya mereka direndahkan. Kalau orang bisa berpendapatan sepuluh pound seminggu sebagai pengemis, profesi ini akan segera menduduki posisi terhormat. Seorang pengemis, dilihat secara realistis, adalah sekedar seorang pengusaha yang mencoba bertahan hidup, seperti halnya pengusaha lain, dengan cara menggunakan tangannya. Dia tidak pernah menjual kehormatannya, lebih dari kebanyakan orang modern; dia hanya berbuat kesalahan dengan memilih usaha yang tidak memberinya kemungkinan untuk jadi kaya (hal. 268)","It is always the anvil that breaks the hammer, never the other way about.","In a Society in which there is no law, and in theory no compulsion, the only arbiter of behaviour is public opinion. But public opinion, because of the tremendous urge to conformity in gregarious animals, is less tolerant than any system of law.

Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress toward more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy--everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now.

There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always--do not forget this, Winston--always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless.

One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, willful act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.","A tramp, therefore, is a celibate from the moment when he takes to the road. He is absolutely without hope of getting a wife, a mistress, or any kind of woman except \u2014 very rarely, when he can raise a few shillings \u2014 a prostitute.It is obvious what the results of this must be: homosexuality, for instance, and occasional rape cases. But deeper than these there is the degradation worked in a man who knows that he is not even considered fit for marriage. The sexual impulse, not to put it any higher, is a fundamental impulse, and starvation of it can be almost as demoralizing as physical hunger. The evil of poverty is not so much that it makes a man suffer as that it rots him physically and spiritually. And there can be no doubt that sexual starvation contributes to this rotting process. Cut off from the whole race of women, a tramp feels himself degraded to the rank of a cripple or a lunatic. No humiliation could do more damage to a man\u2019s self-respect.","They were a bit shaken, and sometimes a little dispirited. But at least they never lived to know that everything they\u2019d believed in was just so much junk.

That was what it felt like.","It is not that anyone imagines the law to be just. Everyone knows that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.

Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life \u2014 snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc. \u2014 had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master. Of course such a state of affairs could not last. It was simply a temporary and local phase in an enormous game that is being played over the whole surface of the earth. But it lasted long enough to have its effect upon anyone who experienced it. However much one cursed at the time, one realized afterwards that one had been in contact with something strange and valuable. One had been in a community where hope was more normal than apathy or cynicism, where the word \u2018comrade\u2019 stood for comradeship and not, as in most countries, for humbug. One had breathed the air of equality. I am well aware that it is now the fashion to deny that Socialism has anything to do with equality. In every country in the world a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy \u2018proving\u2019 that Socialism means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite different from this.","The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.","No emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred.

No, I don\'t. But it may be that the psychological adjustment which the working class are visibly making is the best they could make in the circumstances. They have neither turned revolutionary nor lost their self-respect; merely they have kept their tempers and settled down to make the best of things on a fish-and-chip standard. The alternative would be God knows what continued agonies of despair; or it might be attempted insurrections which, in a strongly governed country like England, could only lead to futile massacres and a regime of savage repression.","Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been re-written, every picture has been re-painted, every statue and street and building has been re-named, every date has been altered.

I thought then and I think now that his attack of \u201cmust was already passing off; in which case he would merely wander harmlessly about until the mahout came back and caught him. Moreover, I did not in the least want to shoot him. I decided that I would watch him for a little while to make sure that he did not turn savage again, and then go home.But at that moment I glanced round at the crowd that had followed me. It was an immense crowd, two thousand at the least and growing every minute. It blocked the road for a long distance on either side. I looked at the sea of yellow faces above the garish clothes-faces all happy and excited over this bit of fun, all certain that the elephant was going to be shot. They were watching me as they would watch a conjurer about to perform a trick. They did not like me, but with the magical rifle in my hands I was momentarily worth watching. And suddenly I realized that I should have to shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me and I had got to do it; I could feel their two thousand wills pressing me forward, irresistibly. And it was at this moment, as I stood there with the rifle in my hands, that I first grasped the hollowness, the futility of the white man\u2019s dominion in the East. Here was I, the white man with his gun, standing in front of the unarmed native crowd \u2014 seemingly the leading actor of the piece; but in reality I was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind. I perceived in this moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys. He becomes a sort of hollow, posing dummy, the conventionalized figure of a sahib. For it is the condition of his rule that he shall spend his life in trying to impress the \u201cnatives,\u201d and so in every crisis he has got to do what the \u201cnatives\u201d expect of him. He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it. I had got to shoot the elephant. I had committed myself to doing it when I sent for the rifle. A sahib has got to act like a sahib; he has got to appear resolute, to know his own mind and do definite things. To come all that way, rifle in hand, with two thousand people marching at my heels, and then to trail feebly away, having done nothing \u2014 no, that was impossible. The crowd would laugh at me. And my whole life, every white man\u2019s life in the East, was one long struggle not to be laughed at.\u201d","As soon as I knew that the bullet had gone clean through my neck I took it for granted that I was done for.

Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is. They could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly; but since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the level of popular education is actually declining. What opinions the masses hold,or do not hold, is looked on as matter of indifference. They can me granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect.","While freely conceding that the Soviet regime exhibits certain features which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think, agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is an unavoidable concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigors which the Russian people have been called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement.","To think, to think, even with a split second left\u2014to think was the only hope.","The great mass of human beings are not acutely selfish. After the age of about thirty they abandon individual ambition\u2014in many cases, indeed, they almost abandon the sense of being individuals at all\u2014and live chiefly for others, or are simply smothered under drudgery.","It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of the was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because, being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice.","That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely the love of one person, but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear the Party to pieces.","It is Sunday afternoon, preferably before the war. The wife is already asleep in the armchair, and the children have been sent out for a nice long walk. You put your feet up on the sofa, settle your spectacles on your nose, and open the News of the World. Roast beef and Yorkshire, or roast pork and apple sauce, followed up by suet pudding and driven home, as it were, by a cup of mahogany-brown tea, have put you in just the right mood. Your pipe is drawing sweetly, the sofa cushions are soft underneath you, the fire is well alight, the air is warm and stagnant. In these blissful circumstances, what is it that you want to read about? Naturally, about a murder.","Similarly with the plongeur. He is a king compared with a rickshaw puller or a gharry pony, but his case isanalogous. He is the slave of a hotel or a restaurant, and his slavery is more or less useless. For, after all, where isthe REAL need of big hotels and smart restaurants? They are supposed to provide luxury, but in reality they provide only a cheap, shoddy imitation of it. Nearly everyone hates hotels. Some restaurants are better than others, but it is impossible to get as good a meal in a restaurant as one can get, for the same expense, in a private house. No doubt hotels and restaurants must exist, but there is no need that they should enslave hundreds of people. What makes the work in them is not the essentials; it is the shams that are supposed to represent luxury. Smartness, as it is called, means, in effect, merely that the staff work more and the customers pay more; no one benefits except the proprietor, who will presently buy himself a striped villa at Deauville.Essentially, a \u2018smart\u2019 hotel is a place where a hundred people toil like devils in order that two hundred may pay through the nose for things they do not really want. If the nonsense were cut out of hotels and restaurants, and the work done with simple efficiency, plongeurs might work six or eight hours a day instead of ten or fifteen.","Prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house.","En tiempos de enga\xf1o universal, decir la verdad se convierte en un acto revolucionario.\u201d","In the olddays, he thought, a man looked at a girl\u2019s body and saw that it was desirable, and that was the endof the story. But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, becauseeverything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax avictory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.","George Orwell, on how to avoid thinking when you speak:You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. they will construct your sentences for you -- even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent -- and at need they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself. It is at this point that the special connexion between politics and the debasement of language becomes clear...It does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug. The attraction of this, is that it is easy.","It was only an \'opeless fancy,It passed lika an Ipril dye,But a look an\' a word an\' the dreams they stirredThey \'ave stolen my \'eart awye!\'They sye that time \'eals all things,They sye you can always forget;But the smiles an\' the tears across the yearsThey twist my \'eart-strings yet!","Waiters are seldom socialists.","Of its very nature swearing is as irrational as magic \u2014 indeed, it is a species of magic.","I\'m thirty-nine years old.

The inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, and yet it was almost as transparent as air. It was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete. He had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that in fact he was inside it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table, and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. The paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was Julia\'s life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.","But even that was a memorable event in the locked loneliness in which one had to live.","To these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tidal wave.

One is constantly learning new facts, and old ones have to drop out to make way for them. At twenty I could have written the history of my schooldays with an accuracy which would be quite impossible now. But it can also happen that one\'s memories grow sharper after a long lapse of time, because one is looking at the past with fresh eyes and can isolate and, as it were, notice facts which previously existed undifferentiated among a mass of others.","But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that. When you put it in words it sounded reasonable; it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith.","The calamities that are constantly being reported - battles, massacres, famines, revolutions - tend to inspire in the average person a feeling of unreality. One has no way of verifying the facts, one is not even fully certain that they have happened, and one is always presented with totally different interpretations from different sources. Probably the truth is discoverable, but the facts will be so dishonestly set forth in almost any newspaper that the ordinary reader can be forgiven either for swallowing lies or for failing to form an opinion. The general uncertainty as to what is really happening makes it easier to cling to lunatic beliefs. Since nothing is ever quite proved or disproved, the most unmistakable fact can be impudently denied. Moreover, although endlessly brooding on power, victory, defeat, revenge, the nationalist is often somewhat uninterested in what happens in the real world. What he wants is to feel that his own unit is getting the better of some other unit, and he can more easily do this by scoring off an adversary than by examining the facts to see whether they support him.","B\xfct\xfcn hayvanlar e\u015fittir ama baz\u0131lar\u0131 daha e\u015fittir.","He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless,because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so ...","Quite likely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted.","... \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0631\u0636 \u0628\u0648\u0643\u0633\u0631 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0628\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0625\u062c\u0627\u0632\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f . \u0648\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u0643\u0631\u0627\u0645\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u0645\u062d \u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0628\u0623\u0644\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0641 \u0644\u0643\u0644\u0648\u0641\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0631 \u0627\u062f \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0631 \u064a\u0624\u0644\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u062f \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0643\u0644\u0648\u0641\u0631 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u062c \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0631\u0647 \u0628\u0643\u0645\u0627\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0634\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0639\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0636\u063a \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0648\u0628\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u062b\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0623\u0642\u0644 \u0642\u0627\u0621\u0644\u0629 \\" \u0631\u0621\u062a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0635\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u062f","But at any rate, one thing was certain.

I think the following rules will cover most cases: (i) Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.(ii) Never use a long words where a short one will do.(iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.(iv) Never use the passive where you can use the active.(v) Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.(vi) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything out-right barbarous. These rules sound elementary, and so they are, but they demand a deep change of attitude in anyone who has grown used to writing in the style now fashionable. One could keep all of them and still write bad English, but one could not write the kind of stuff that I quoted in those five specimens at the beginning of this article.","For every heretic it burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up.

He is no doubt aware that he ought to be a Socialist. But he observes first the dullness of individual Socialists, then the apparent flabbiness of Socialist ideals, and veers away. Till quite recently it was natural to veer towards indinerentism. Ten years ago, even five years ago, the typical literary gent wrote books on baroque architecture and had a soul above politics. But that attitude is becoming difficult and even unfashionable. The times are growing harsher, the issues are clearer, the belief that nothing will ever change (i.e. that your dividends will always be safe) is less prevalent. The fence on which the literary gent sits, once as comfortable as the plush cushion of a cathedral-stall, is now pinching his bottom intolerably; more and more he shows a disposition to drop off on one side or the other. It is interesting to notice how many of our leading writers, who a dozen years ago were art for art\'s saking for all they were worth and would have considered it too vulgar for words to even vote at a general election, are now taking a definite political standpoint; while most of the younger writers, at least those of them who are not mere footlers, have been \'political\' from the start. I believe that when the pinch comes there is a terrible danger that the main movement of the intelligentsia will be towards Fascism. . . . That will also be the moment when every person with any brains or decency will know in his bones that he ought to be on the Socialist side. But he will not necessarily come there of his own accord; there are too many ancient prejudices standing in the way. He will have to be persuaded, and by methods that imply an understanding of his viewpoint. Socialists cannot afford to waste any more time in preaching to the converted.

Happiness hitherto has been a by-product, and for all we know it may always remain so. The real objective of Socialism is human brotherhood. This is widely felt to be the case, though it is not usually said, or not said loudly enough. Men use up their lives in heart-breaking political struggles, or get themselves killed in civil wars, or tortured in the secret prisons of the Gestapo, not in order to establish some central-heated, air-conditioned, strip-lighted Paradise, but because they want a world in which human beings love one another instead of swindling and murdering one another. And they want that world as a first step. Where they go from there is not so certain, and the attempt to foresee it in detail merely confuses the issue.","We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone.","I was just passing the coppersmiths\u2019 booths when somebody noticed that I was lighting a cigarette. Instantly, from the dark holes all round, there was a frenzied rush of Jews, many of them old grandfathers with flowing grey beards, all clamouring for a cigarette. Even a blind man somewhere at the back of one of the booths heard a rumour of cigarettes and came crawling out, groping in the air with his hand. In about a minute I had used up the whole packet. None of these people, I suppose, works less than twelve hours a day, and every one of them looks on a cigarette as a more or less impossible luxury.","England will still be England, an everlasting animal stretching into the future and the past, and, like all living things, having the power to change out of recognition and yet remain the same.","But what a way to do things-never to perform a decent action until you are kicked into it and the rest of the world has ceased to believe that your motives can possibly be honest.","For the rest, she grew used to the life that she was leading - used to the enormous sleepless nights, the cold, the dirt, the boredom, and the horrible communism of the Square. After a day or two she had ceased to feel even a flicker of surprise at her situation. She had come, like everyone about her, to accept this monstrous existence almost as though it were normal. The dazed, witless feeling that she had known on the way to the hopfields had come back upon her more strongly than before. It is the common effect of sleeplessness and still more of exposure. To live continuously in the open air, never going under a roof for more than an hour or two, blurs your perceptions like a strong light glaring in your eyes or a noise drumming in your ears. You act and plan and suffer, and yet all the while it is as though everything were a little out of focus, a little unreal. The world, inner and outer, grows dimmer till it reaches almost the vagueness of a dream.","The tank, the submarine, the torpedo, the machine-gun, even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use.","The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one is sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of fastening one\'s love upon other human individuals. No double alcohol, tobacco, and so forth, are things that a saint must avoid, but sainthood is also a thing that human beings must avoid. There is an obvious retort to this, but one should be wary about making it. In this yogi-ridden age, it is too readily assumed that \\"non-attachment\\" is not only better than a full acceptance of earthly life, but that the ordinary man only rejects it because it is too difficult: in other words, that the average human being is a failed saint. It is doubtful whether this is true. Many people genuinely do not wish to be saints, and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human beings. If one could follow it to its psychological roots, one would, I believe, find that the main motive for \\"non-attachment\\" is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work. But it is not necessary here to argue whether the otherworldly or the humanistic ideal is \\"higher.\\" The point is that they are incompatible. One must choose between God and Man, and all \\"radicals\\" and \\"progressives,\\" from the mildest Liberal to the most extreme Anarchist, have in effect chosen Man.","Fishing is the opposite of war.","Room 101,\u2019 he said.","When I worked in a second-hand bookshop \u2014 so easily pictured, if you don\'t work in one, as a kind of paradise where charming old gentlemen browse eternally among calf-bound folios \u2014 the thing that chiefly struck me was the rarity of really bookish people. Our shop had an exceptionally interesting stock, yet I doubt whether ten per cent of our customers knew a good book from a bad one. First edition snobs were much commoner than lovers of literature, but oriental students haggling over cheap textbooks were commoner still, and vague-minded women looking for birthday presents for their nephews were commonest of all.","To dislike a writer\u2019s politics is one thing. To dislike him because he forces you to think is another, not necessarily incompatible with the first.","Si que\xadda\xadba al\xadgu\xadna es\xadpe\xadran\xadza, deb\xeda estar en los pro\xadles, por\xadque solo en esas masas des\xadpre\xadcia\xaddas, que cons\xadti\xadtu\xedan el ochen\xadta y cinco por cien\xadto de la po\xadbla\xadci\xf3n de Ocea\xadn\xeda, pod\xeda ge\xadne\xadrar\xadse la fuer\xadza ne\xadce\xadsa\xadria para des\xadtruir al Par\xadti\xaddo.

Therefore, argues Wells, he is an absurdity, a ghost from the past, a creature doomed to disappear almost immediately. But unfortunately the equation of science with common sense does not really hold good. The aeroplane, which was looked forward to as a civilising influence but in practice has hardly been used except for dropping bombs, is the symbol of that fact. Modern Germany is far more scientific than England, and far more barbarous. Much of what Wells has imagined and worked for is physically there in Nazi Germany. The order, the planning, the State encouragement of science, the steel, the concrete, the aeroplanes, are all there, but all in the service of ideas appropriate to the Stone Age.","how men, when given power over other men, start to behave like pigs.","\u0628\u0648\u0633\u0639\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0631\u0647\u0648\u0643 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0623\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u064a\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0648\u0646\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0647\u0643 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0624\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0642\u0648\u0644\u0647","Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude toward one another, have varied from age to age; but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other.","Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card.","The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labor. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labor power without producing anything that can be consumed.The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another, but though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs.","The scene had interested me. It was so different from the ordinary demeanour of tramps--from the abject worm-like gratitude with which they normally accept charity. The explanation, of course, was that we outnumbered the congregation and so were not afraid of them.

The sort of things that are working against him are the concentration of the press in the hands of a few rich men, the grip of monopoly on radio and the films, the unwillingness of the public to spend money on books, making it necessary for nearly every writer to earn part of his living by hackwork\u2026 Everything in our age conspires to turn the writer, and every other kind of artist as well, into a minor official, working on themes handed down from above and never telling what seems to him the whole of the truth. But in struggling against this fate he gets no help from his own side: that is, there is no large body of opinion which will assure him that he\u2019s in the right.","In theory it is still possible to be an orthodox religious believer without being intellectually crippled in the process.","The clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same.","It was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love. It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one\'s consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future time, preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, willful act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.","A slave, Marcus Cato said, should be working when he is not sleeping. It does not matter whether his work in itself is good in itself\u2014for slaves, at least. This sentiment still survives, and it has piled up mountains of useless drudgery. I believe that this instinct to perpetuate useless work is, at bottom, simply fear of the mob. The mob (the thought runs) are such low animals that they would be dangerous if they had leisure; it is safer to keep them too busy to think. A rich man who happens to be intellectually honest, if he is questioned about the improvement of working conditions, usually says something like this: \\"We know that poverty is unpleasant; in fact, since it is so remote, we rather enjoy harrowing ourselves with the thought of its unpleasantness. But don\u2019t expect us to do anything about it. We are sorry fort you lower classes, just as we are sorry for a cat with the mange, of your condition. We feel that you are much safer as you are. The present state of affairs suits us, and we are not going to take the risk of setting you free, even by an extra hour a day. So, dear brothers, since evidently you must sweat to pay for our trips to Italy, sweat and be damned to you. This is particularly the attitude of intelligent, cultivated people; one can read the substance if it in a hundred essays. Very few cultivated people have less than (say) four hundred pounds a year, and naturally they side with the rich, because they imagine that any liberty conceded to the poor is a threat to their own liberty. foreseeing some dismal Marxian Utopia as the alternative, the educated man prefers to keep things as they are. Possibly he does not like his fellow-rich very much, but he supposes that even the vulgarest of them are less inimical to his pleasures, more his kind of people, than the poor, and that he had better stand by them. It is this fear of a supposedly dangerous mob that makes nearly all intelligent people conservative in their opinions. Fear of the mob is a superstitious fear. It is based on the idea that there is some mysterious, fundamental difference between rich and poor, as though they were two different races, like negroes and white men. But in reality there is no such difference. The mass of the rich and the poor are differentiated by their incomes and nothings else, and the average millionaire is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit. Change places, and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Everyone who has mixed on equal terms with the poor knows this quite well. But the trouble is that intelligent, cultivated people, the very people who might be expected to have liberal opinions, never do mix with the poor. For what do the majority of educated people know about poverty? In my copy of Villon\u2019s poems the editor has actually thought it necessary to explain the line \u201cNe pain ne voyent qu\'aux fenestres\u201d by a footnote; so remote is even hunger from the educated man\u2019s experience. From this ignorance a superstitious fear of the mob results quite naturally. The educated man pictures a horde of submen, wanting only a day\u2019s liberty to loot his house, burn his books, and set him to work minding a machine or sweeping out a lavatory. \u201cAnything,\u201d he thinks, \u201cany injustice, sooner than let that mob loose.\u201d","\u0625\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0630\u0648 \u063a\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0629\u060c \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0637\u0627\u0645\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0624\u0633. \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0641\u0643\u0631\u062a \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644\u064b\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0624\u0633 -\u0641\u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0626 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0633 \u062e\u0634\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0637\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0643\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0626 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0633\u064a\u062d\u0635\u0644 \u0644\u0643 \u0639\u0627\u062c\u0644\u064b\u0627 \u0623\u0648 \u0622\u062c\u0644\u064b\u0627\u060c \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u0641\u0643\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0643\u0644\u064a\u064b\u0627. \u0623\u0646\u062a \u0638\u0646\u0646\u062a \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0633\u0627\u0637\u0629\u060c \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0625\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0642\u062f \u062c\u062f\u064b\u0627. \u0623\u0646\u062a \u062d\u0633\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0631\u0647\u064a\u0628\u064b\u0627\u060c \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u062e\u064c \u0648 \u0645\u0636\u062c\u0631\u064c \u0641\u0642\u0637.","Socialism does mean justice and liberty when the nonsense is stripped off it.","O\u2019Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing the worn face nearer. You are thinking, he said, that my face is old and tired. You are thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body. Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual is only a cell? The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism. Do you die when you cut your fingernails? We are priests of power, he said. God is power. But at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned. It is time for you to gather some idea of what power means. The first thing you must realise is that power is collective. The individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual. You know the Party slogan: \u2018Freedom is slavery\u2019. Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is freedom. Alone \u2013 free- the human being is always defeated. It must be so, because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he is the Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to realise is that power is power over human beings. Over the body \u2013 but, above all, over the mind. Power over matter \u2013 external reality, as you would call it \u2013 is not important. Already our control over matter is absolute\u2026.But how can you control matter? He burst out. You don\u2019t even control the climate or the law of gravity. And there are disease, pain, death- O\u2019Brien silenced him by a movement of the hand. We control matter because we control the mind. Reality is inside the skull. You will learn by degrees, Winston\u2026.But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny-helpless! How long has he been in existence? For millions of years the earth was uninhabited\u2026Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older? Nothing exist except through human consciousness\u2026","It struck me that perhaps a lot of people you see walking about are dead. We say that a man\'s dead when his heart stops and not before. It seems a bit arbitrary. After all, parts of your body don\'t stop working - hair goes on growing for years, for instance. Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea. Old Porteous is like that. Wonderfully learned, wonderfully good taste - but he\'s not capable of change. Just says the same things and thinks the same thoughts over and over again. There are a lot of people like that. Dead minds, stopped inside. Just keep moving backwards and forwards on the same little track, getting fainter all the time, like ghosts.","To turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston out of nests of hair.","It is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during \'God save the King\' than of stealing from a poor box","\u0625\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0647\u062f\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0634\u064a\u0621 \u060c \u0628\u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0645\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647\u062a\u0647 ... \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0641\u0643\u0631 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u060c \u0648\u0639\u0646\u062f \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u062a\u0642\u0648\u0644: \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0641\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0628\u064a \u060c \u0627\u0641\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0647 \u0628\u0623\u062d\u062f \u063a\u064a\u0631\u064a. \u0648\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0643 \u062a\u062a\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062c\u0631\u062f \u062e\u062f\u0639\u0629 \u0642\u0644\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u062a\u062c\u0639\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0643\u0641\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0643 \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0642\u0635\u062f\u0647 \u062d\u0642\u0627 . \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0635\u062d\u064a\u062d! \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0641\u0625\u0646\u0643 \u062a\u0642\u0635\u062f\u0647 \u060c \u0648\u0623\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0644\u0625\u0646\u0642\u0627\u0630 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u060c \u0648\u062a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u062d\u0642\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631 \u060c \u0648\u0623\u0646\u062a \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0639\u0628\u0623 \u0625\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0627 \u0628\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631 . \u0625\u0646\u0643 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0647\u062a\u0645 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643","Na bojnom polju, u mu\u010dili\u0161tu, na brodu koji tone, razlozi zbog kojih se bori\u0161 uvijek se zaborave jer se tijelo nadimlje sve dok ne ispuni cijeli tvoj svemir, pa \u010dak i onda kad te nije paralizirao strah ili ne vri\u0161ti\u0161 od boli, \u017eivot je od trenutka do trenutka, samo borba protiv gladi ili hladno\u0107e ili sna, protiv pokvarena \u017eeluca ili zuba koji boli.","To mark the paper was the decisive act.","Bug\xfcnlerde fikir sahibi herkes korkudan kaskat\u0131 kesiliyor.","Essentially, a \u2018smart\u2019 hotel is a place where a hundred people toil like devils in order that two hundred may pay through the nose for things they do not really want.","\u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u062c\u062d\u0646 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0646\u0642\u064a\u0628 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u064a\u0639\u0637\u0649 \u0628\u0637\u0627\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0645\u062c\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0635\u062f\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u062c\u0645\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0631\u062d , \u0641\u0643\u0646 \u064a\u062c\u0644\u0633\u0646 \u0633\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0639 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0633\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u062e\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0642\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0641\u0647\u0645\u0646 \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0642\u062f\u0631\u0646 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0647\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0646 \u064a\u0634\u0639\u0631\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0635\u0644\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0634\u0626 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644 \u0644\u0627 \u0634\u0626","I am walking up and down the line of sentries, under the dark boughs of the poplars.

This is unquestionably true. Moreover, if one is to love God, or to love humanity as a whole, one cannot give one\'s preference to any individual person. This again is true, and it marks the point at which the humanistic and the religious attitude cease to be reconcilable. To an ordinary human being, love means nothing if it does not mean loving some people more than others. The autobiography leaves it uncertain whether Gandhi behaved in an inconsiderate way to his wife and children, but at any rate it makes clear that on three occasions he was willing to let his wife or a child die rather than administer the animal food prescribed by the doctor. It is true that the threatened death never actually occurred, and also that Gandhi \u2014 with, one gathers, a good deal of moral pressure in the opposite direction \u2014 always gave the patient the choice of staying alive at the price of committing a sin: still, if the decision had been solely his own, he would have forbidden the animal food, whatever the risks might be. There must, he says, be some limit to what we will do in order to remain alive, and the limit is well on this side of chicken broth. This attitude is perhaps a noble one, but, in the sense which \u2014 I think \u2014 most people would give to the word, it is inhuman. The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one is sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of fastening one\'s love upon other human individuals. No doubt alcohol, tobacco, and so forth, are things that a saint must avoid, but sainthood is also a thing that human beings must avoid. There is an obvious retort to this, but one should be wary about making it. In this yogi-ridden age, it is too readily assumed that \u201cnon-attachment\u201d is not only better than a full acceptance of earthly life, but that the ordinary man only rejects it because it is too difficult: in other words, that the average human being is a failed saint. It is doubtful whether this is true. Many people genuinely do not wish to be saints, and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human beings. If one could follow it to its psychological roots, one would, I believe, find that the main motive for \u201cnon-attachment\u201d is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work. But it is not necessary here to argue whether the other-worldly or the humanistic ideal is \u201chigher\u201d. The point is that they are incompatible. One must choose between God and Man, and all \u201cradicals\u201d and \u201cprogressives\u201d, from the mildest Liberal to the most extreme Anarchist, have in effect chosen Man.\u201d","And in front of him there lay not death but annihilation.","It would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless.

When one sees the slavish or boastful rubbish that is written about Stalin, the Red army, etc. by fairly intelligent and sensitive people, one realizes that this is only possible because some kind of dislocation has taken place.

It is a question first of all of discovering what one really is, what one\u2019s own feelings really are, and then of making allowance for the inevitable bias. If you hate and fear Russia, if you are jealous of the wealth and power of America, if you despise Jews, if you have a sentiment of inferiority towards the British ruling class, you cannot get rid of those feelings simply by taking thought. But you can at least recognize that you have them, and prevent them from contaminating your mental processes. The emotional urges which are inescapable, and are perhaps even necessary to political action, should be able to exist side by side with an acceptance of reality. But this, I repeat, needs a moral effort, and contemporary English literature, so far as it is alive at all to the major issues of our time, shows how few of us are prepared to make it.","He who controls the past, controls the future; and he who controls the present, controls the past.","To anyone who had been there since the beginning it probably seemed even in December or January that the revolutionary period was ending; but when one came straight from England the aspect of Barcelona was something startling and overwhelming. It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties; almost every church had been gutted and its images burnt. Churches here and there were being systematically demolished by gangs of workman. Every shop and cafe had an inscription saying that it had been collectivised;even the bootblacks had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in theface and treated you as an equal. Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said\'Sen~or\' or \'Don\' ort even \'Usted\'; everyone called everyone else \'Comrade\' or \'Thou\', and said \'Salud!\' instead of \'Buenosdias\'. Tipping had been forbidden by law since the time of Primo de Rivera; almost my first experience was receiving a lecturefrom a hotel manager for trying to tip a lift-boy. There were no private motor-cars, they had all been commandeered, and thetrams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted red and black. The revolutionary posters were everywhere,flaming from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining advertisements look like daubs of mud. Down theRamblas, the wide central artery of the town where crowds of people streamed constantly to and fro, the loud-speakers werebellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into the night. And it was the aspect of the crowds that was the queerest thing ofall. In outward appearance it was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist. Except for a smallnumber of women and foreigners there were no \'well-dressed\' people at all. Practically everyone wore rough working-classclothes, or blue overalls or some variant of militia uniform. All this was queer and moving. There was much in this that I did notunderstand, in some ways I did not not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for. Also, Ibelieved that things were as they appeared, that this was really a workers\' State and that the entire bourgeoisie had either fled,been killed or voluntarily come over to the workers\' side; I did not realise that great numbers of well-to-do bourgeois weresimply lying low and disguising themselves as proletarians for the time being.","Don\u2019t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we\u2019re not far from that point. But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. Even now, of course, there\u2019s no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime. It\u2019s merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control. But in the end there won\u2019t be any need even for that. The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect.","Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life - the need to eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of top-storey windows, and the like.","The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour.","Bisa dikatakan semakin mahal makanan, semakin banyak keringat dan ludah yang harus dimakan.","Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one\u2019s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. The Party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated. The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. Doublethink lies at the very heart of Ingsoc, since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies\u2014all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the Party has been able\u2014and may, for all we know, continue to be able for thousands of years\u2014to arrest the course of history.","The fat Russian agent was cornering all the foreign refugees in turn and explaining plausibly that this whole affair was an Anarchist plot.

The Northerner has \'grit\', he is grim, \'dour\', plucky, warm-hearted and democratic; the Southerner is snobbish, effeminate and lazy - that at any rate is the theory. Hence the Southerner goes north, at any rate for the first time, with the vague inferiority-complex of a civilized man venturing among savages, while the Yorkshireman, like the Scotchman, comes to London in the spirit of a barbarian out for loot.","accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated...the only victory lay in the far future long after you were dead...","The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia.

The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of r\xe9gime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.","All true tea lovers not only like their tea strong, but like it a little stronger with each year that passes \u2014 a fact which is recognized in the extra ration issued to old-age pensioners.","The primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of themachine without raising the general standard of living.","Hasta que no tengan consciencia de su fuerza, no se rebelar\xe1n, y hasta despu\xe9s de haberse rebelado, no ser\xe1n conscientes. \xc9ste es el problema.","Indeed, when one sees how tramps let themselves be bullied by the workhouse officials, it is obvious that they are the most docile, broken-spirited creatures imaginable.","If you set yourself to it, you can live the same life, rich or poor, you can still keep on with your books and your ideas.

It does not matter whether his work is needed or not, he must work, because work in itself is good\u2014for slaves, at least. This sentiment still survives, and it has piled up mountains of useless drudgery.","We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men. If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear. In times of universal deceit, telling the truth will be a revolutionary act.","For how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory?","Before the swallow, before the daffodil, and not much later than the snowdrop, the common toad salutes the coming of spring after his own fashion, which is to emerge from a hole in the ground, where he has lain buried since the previous autumn, and crawl as rapidly as possible towards the nearest suitable patch of water. Something \u2013 some kind of shudder in the earth, or perhaps merely a rise of a few degrees in the temperature \u2013 has told him it is time to wake up ... At this period, after his long fast, the toad has a very spiritual look, like a strict Anglo-Catholic towards the end of Lent. His movements are languid but purposeful, his body is shrunken, and by contrast his eyes look abnormally large. This allows one to notice, what one might not at any other time, that a toad has about the most beautiful eye of any living creature. It is like gold, or more exactly it is like the golden-coloured semi-precious stone which one sometimes sees in signet rings, and which I think is called a chrysoberyl.","It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags and with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties; almost every church had been gutted and its images burnt. Churches here and there were being systematically demolished by gangs of workmen. Every shop and cafe had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even the bootblacks had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal. Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said \'Se\xf1or\' or \'Don\' or even \'Usted\'; everyone called everyone else \'Comrade\' or \'Thou\', and said \'Salud!\' instead of \'Buenos d\xedas\'. Tipping had been forbidden by law since the time of Primo de Rivera; almost my first experience was receiving a lecture from a hotel manager for trying to tip a lift-boy. There were no private motor-cars, they had all been commandeered, and the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted red and black. The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining advertisements look like daubs of mud. Down the Ramblas, the wide central artery of the town where crowds of people streamed constantly to and from, the loud-speakers were bellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into the night. And it was the aspect of the crowds that was the queerest thing of all. In outward appearance it was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist. Except for a small number of women and foreigners there were no \'well-dressed\' people at all. Practically everyone wore rough working-class clothes, or blue overalls or some variant of militia uniform. All this was queer and moving. There was much in this that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for...so far as one could judge the people were contented and hopeful. There was no unemployment, and the price of living was still extremely low; you saw very few conspicuously destitute people, and no beggars except the gypsies. Above all, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom.

He felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood and lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations seemed to be magnified. His overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet, even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak.","Quand on aimait, on aimait, et quand on n\'avait rien d\'autre \xe0 donner, on donnait son amour.","I suppose we may as well say goodbye.","Women who do not marry wither up - they wither up like aspidistras in back-parlour windows; and the devilish thing is that they don\u2019t even know they\u2019re withering.","\u0641\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u0649 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0637\u0628\u0642\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0635\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0627 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0631\u0648\u062c \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0647\u0646\u0629 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0643\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u064a\u0634\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u062a\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0637\u0623\u0629 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u064a\u0637\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0639\u0648\u062f\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0648\u064a\u0636 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0622\u0633\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0641\u0649 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0649 \u064a\u0623\u062a\u0649 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a ...\u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0633\u0637\u0649 \u0641\u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0625\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0636\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0628\u0644\u0648\u063a \u0633\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u0627\u0621 \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0646\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0636\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u0649 \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0644\u0648\u063a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629 \u064a\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0644\u0647\u062c\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0628\u0644\u063a\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0633\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0623\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0644\u0648\u063a\u0647 \u0641\u0649 \u0639\u0647\u062f \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628 . \u0648\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u0649 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0633\u0637\u0649 \u062a\u0634\u0639\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0648\u0631\u0627\u062a \u062a\u062d\u062a \u0633\u062a\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0648\u0627\u0629 \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0644\u0628\u062b \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0628\u0644\u0648\u063a \u0645\u0623\u0631\u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u062f\u0634\u0646\u062a \u0644\u0637\u063a\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u062a\u0642\u064a\u0645\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0642\u0627\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u063a\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0649 \u0623\u0637\u0627\u062d\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0649 \u0633\u062a\u062d\u0644 \u0645\u062d\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0633\u0637\u0649 \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u0641\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0637\u063a\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 .","People are wrong when they think that an unemployed man only worries about losing his wages; on the contrary, an illiterate man, with the work habit in his bones, needs work even more than he needs money.

But a man like Paddy, with no means of filling up time, is as miserable out of work as a dog on the chain.","Les meilleurs livres sont ceux qui racontent ce que l\'on sait d\xe9j\xe0.","Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. \'If I wished,\' O\'Brien had said, \'I could float off this floor like a soap bubble.\' Winston worked it out. \'If he thinks he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously think I see him do it, then the thing happens.\' Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: \'It doesn\'t really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination.\' He pushed the thought under instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a \'real\' world where \'real\' things happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens. He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and he was in no danger of succumbing to it. He realized, nevertheless, that it ought never to have occurred to him. The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive. Crimestop, they called it in Newspeak. He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented himself with propositions -- \'the Party says the earth is flat\', \'the party says that ice is heavier than water\' -- and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy. It needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as \'two and two make five\' were beyond his intellectual grasp. It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.","He does not act, he is acted upon.

The sweet corpsy smell, the rustle of Sunday dresses, the wheeze of the organ and the roaring voices, the spot of light from the hole in the window creeping slowly up the nave. In some way the grown-ups could put it across that this extraordinary performance was necessary. You took it for granted, just as you took the Bible, which you got in big doses in those days. There were texts on every wall and you knew whole chapters of the O.T. by heart. Even now my head\u2019s stuffed full of bits out of the Bible. And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord. And Asher abode in his breaches. Followed them from Dan until thou come unto Beersheba. Smote him under the fifth rib, so that he died. You never understood it, you didn\u2019t try to or want to, it was just a kind of medicine, a queer-tasting stuff that you had to swallow and knew to be in some way necessary. An extraordinary rigmarole about people with names like Shimei and Nebuchadnezzar and Ahithophel and Hash-badada; people with long stiff garments and Assyrian beards, riding up and down on camels among temples and cedar trees and doing extraordinary things. Sacrificing burnt offerings, walking about in fiery furnaces, getting nailed on crosses, getting swallowed by whales. And all mixed up with the sweet graveyard smell and the serge dresses and the wheeze of the organ.\u201d","Kochany, nie obchodz\u0105 mnie nast\u0119pne pokolenia!

The central issue has been successfully covered up.","La cosa orribi\xadle dei Due Minuti d\'Odio era che nessuno veniva obbligato a recitare. Evitare di farsi coinvolgere era infatti impossibile. Un\'estasi orrenda, indotta da un misto di paura e di sordo rancore, un desiderio di uccidere, di torturare, di spaccare facce a martellate, sembrava attraversare come una corrente elettrica tutte le persone l\xec raccolte, trasformando il singolo individuo, anche contro la sua volont\xe0, in un folle urlante, il volto alterato da smorfie. E tuttavia, la rabbia che ognuno provava costituiva un\'emozione astratta, indiretta, che era possibile spostare da un oggetto all\'altro come una fiamma ossidrica.","Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold.","In our age there is no such thing as \u2018keeping out of politics\u2019. All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia.","But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction\u2014indeed, in some sense was the destruction\u2014of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realise that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.","All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and re-inscribed exactly as often as was necessary.","The [Victory Gin] was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club.

It was not the man\u2019s brain that was speaking, it was his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.","Pacifist literature abounds with equivocal remarks which, if they mean anything, appear to mean that statesmen of the type of Hitler are preferable to those of the type of Churchill, and that violence is perhaps excusable if it is violent enough. After the fall of France, the French pacifists, faced by a real choice which their English colleagues have not had to make, mostly went over to the Nazis, and in England there appears to have been some small overlap of membership between the Peace Pledge Union and the Blackshirts. Pacifist writers have written in praise of Carlyle, one of the intellectual fathers of Fascism. All in all it is difficult not to feel that pacifism, as it appears among a section of the intelligentsia, is secretly inspired by an admiration for power and successful cruelty.","Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system","\u0648\u0638\u0644 \u0628\u0648\u0643\u0633\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0641\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0648\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0634\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0643\u062a\u0626\u0627\u0628\u060c \u064a\u0647\u0632 \u0630\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u0645\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u064a\u062d\u0645\u062d\u0645: \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0641\u0647\u0645 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u060c \u0648 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u062a\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0631 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0644\u062a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0632\u0631\u0639\u062a\u0646\u0627! \u0641\u0644\u0627\u0628\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0641\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0646\u062d\u0646 \u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u064a\u060c \u0648 \u0644\u0633\u062a \u0623\u0631\u0649 \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0631\u062b\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0634\u0641 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644! \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0622\u0644\u064a\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0642\u0638 \u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0633\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u0633\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0629!\u062b\u0645 \u0631\u0643\u0636 \u0647\u0627\u0628\u0637\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u062c\u0631 \u064a\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062c\u0627\u0631\u060c \u0648\u064a\u0635\u0639\u062f \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621\u060c \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0623\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0644.","Chapter I. Ignorance is Strength. \xa0 Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other. \xa0 \u2018Julia, are you awake?\u2019 said Winston. \u2018Yes, my love, I\u2019m listening. Go on. It\u2019s marvellous.\u2019 He continued reading: \xa0 The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim\u2014for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives\u2014is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters.","There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things.","As a magistrate his methods were simple. Even for the vastest bribe he would never sell the decision of a case, because he knew that a magistrate who gives wrong judgments is caught sooner or later. His practice, a much safer one, was to take bribes from both sides and then decide the case on strictly legal grounds. This won him a useful reputation for impartiality.","There is nothing more dreadful in the world than to live in somebody else\'s house, eating his bread and doing nothing in return for it.","Given a good pitch and the right amount of capital, any educated person ought to be able to make a small secure living out of a bookshop","Bilin\xe7leninceye dek ba\u015fkald\u0131rmayacaklar, ba\u015fkald\u0131rmazlarsa da hi\xe7bir zaman bilin\xe7lenemeyecekler.","Prestige, the breath of life, is itself nebulous.","What mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist. To know that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The room was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk.","Well, Hilda and I were married, and right from the start it was a flop. Why did you marry her? you say. Why did you marry yours? These things happen to us. I wonder whether you\'ll believe that during the first two or three years I had serious thoughts of killing Hilda. Of course in practice one never does these things, they\'re only a kind of fantasy one enjoys thinking about. Besides, chaps who murder their wives always get copped. However cleverly you\'ve faked the alibi, they know perfectly well that it\'s you who did it, and they\'ll pin it onto you somehow.When a woman\'s bumped off, her husband is always the first suspect -which gives you a little side glimpse of what people really think about marriage.","Baju adalah sesuatu yang berkuasa.

Beware the one and only true path.","Tanr\u0131 bana sinekleri kovay\u0131m diye bir kuyruk vermi\u015f; ama ke\u015fke sinekler de olmasayd\u0131, kuyru\u011fum da.","There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always\u2014do not forget this, Winston\u2014always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless.","Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could be tracked down by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture. But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it ultimately make? They could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.","Julia had once been picked out to work in Pornosec, the sub-section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House by the people who worked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like Spanking Stories or One Night in a Girls\u2019 School, to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal. \u201cWhat are these books like? said Winston curiously. \u201cOh, ghastly rubbish. They\u2019re boring, really. They only have six plots, but they swap them round a bit.\u201d","We are not interested in those stupid crimes you have committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about.","You are rotting away. You are falling to pieces. What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn round and look into that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you? That is the last man.

Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.","\u062b\u0645 \u062a\u0633\u0627\u0621\u0644\u060c \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u0627\u0621\u0644 \u0645\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0648\u062a\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0628\u0644\u060c \u0639\u0645\u0627 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0645\u0635\u0627\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0628\u0645\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646. \u0641\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0643\u0644 \u0628\u0633\u0627\u0637\u0629\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0646","Early in life I have noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper, but in Spain, for the first time, I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts, not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie.

I saw troops who had fought bravely denounced as cowards and traitors, and others who had never seen a shot fired hailed as heroes of imaginary victories; and I saw newspapers in London retailing these lies and eager intellectuals building emotional superstructures over events that never happened. I saw, in fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to have happened according to various \u201cparty lines.","It is the peculiar lowness of poverty that you discover first; the shifts that it puts you to, the complicated meanness, the crust-wiping.","There is a word in Newspeak,\u2019 said Syme, \u2018I don\u2019t know whether you know it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck.

Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.","The people who write that kind of stuff never fight; possibly they believe that to write it is a substitute for fighting. It is the same in all wars; the soldiers do the fighting, the journalists do the shouting, and no true patriot ever gets near a front-line trench, except on the briefest of propaganda-tours.","And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn\u2019t really mean it.

And boys\u2019 fiction above all, the blood-and-thunder stuff which nearly every boy devours at some time or other, is sodden in the worst illusions of 1910.

Literature was largely the literature of revolt or of disintegration. Gibbon, Voltaire, Rousseau, Shelley, Byron, Dickens, Stendhal, Samuel Butler, Ibsen, Zola, Flaubert, Shaw, Joyce - in one way or another they are all of them destroyers, wreckers, saboteurs. For two hundred years we had sawed and sawed and sawed at the branch we were sitting on. And in the end, much more suddenly than anyone had forseen, our efforts were rewarded, and down we came. But unfortunately there had been a little mistake. The thing at the bottom had not been a bed of roses after all, it was a cesspool full of barbed wire.","She had grasped the inner meaning of the Party\'s sexual puritanism.

The intensity with which they are held does not prevent nationalist loyalties from being transferable. To begin with, as I have pointed out already, they can be and often are fastened upon some foreign country. One quite commonly finds that great national leaders, or the founders of nationalist movements, do not even belong to the country they have glorified. Sometimes they are outright foreigners, or more often they come from peripheral areas where nationality is doubtful. Examples are Stalin, Hitler, Napoleon,","Be more gay, I beseech you!","They were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty.

To keep them in control was not difficult.","Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you.

It was possible no doubt to imagine a society in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries should be evenly distributed while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice, such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves. And when once they had done this they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past as some thinkers about the beginning of the 20th century dreamed of doing was not a practical solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly by its more advances rivals.","The class-struggle is the main source of progress, and therefore the nobleman who robs the peasant and goads him to revolt is playing a necessary part, just as much as the Jacobin who guillotines the nobleman.","On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the speeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the booming of guns\u2014after six days of this, when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them to pieces\u2014at just this moment it had been announced that Oceania was not after all at war with Eurasia.

And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.","This accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable. In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for political purposes, were short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker\u2019s mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably these words\u2014goodthink, Minipax, prolefeed, sexcrime, joy camp, Ingsoc, bellyfeel, thinkpol, and countless others\u2014were words of two or three syllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. The intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness. For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to make a political or ethical judgment should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. His training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain willful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the process still further. So did the fact of having very few words to choose from. Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised.","Today, for example, one can imagine a good book being written by a Catholic, a Communist, a Fascist, a pacifist, an anarchist, perhaps by an old-style Liberal or an ordinary Conservative: one cannot imagine a good book being written by a spiritualist, a Buchmanite or a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The views that a writer holds must be compatible with sanity, in the medical sense, and with the power of continuous thought: beyond that what we ask of him is talent, which is probably another name for conviction.","Dickens hardly writes of war, even to denounce it.","Always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed--no escape. Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.","The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim - for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives - is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters.","the only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism.","Era uno de esos ensue\xf1os que, a pesar de utilizar toda la escenograf\xeda on\xedrica habitual, son una continuaci\xf3n de nuestra vida intelectual y en los que nos damos cuenta de hechos e ideas que siguen teniendo un valor despu\xe9s del despertar.","the mere difficulty of getting hold of a house is one of the worst aggravations of poverty.","\u0644\u0642\u062f \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0641\u062a\u0642\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0649 \u064a\u062d\u0641\u0638 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628\u0647","As a whole the world is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago.

A society becomes totalitarian when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial: that is, when its ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud. Such a society, no matter how long it persists, can never afford to become either tolerant or intellectually stable. It can never permit either the truthful recording of facts, or the emotional sincerity, that literary creation demands. But to be corrupted by totalitarianism one does not have to live in a totalitarian country. The mere prevalence of certain ideas can spread a poison that makes one subject after another impossible for literary purposes. Wherever there is an enforced orthodoxy\u2014or even two orthodoxies, as often happens\u2014good writing stops. This was well illustrated by the Spanish civil war. To many English intellectuals the war was a deeply moving experience, but not an experience about which they could write sincerely. There were only two things that you were allowed to say, and both of them were palpable lies: as a result, the war produced acres of print but almost nothing worth reading.","After the sorts of winters we have had to endure recently, the spring does seem miraculous, because it has become gradually harder and harder to believe that it is actually going to happen.

Suddenly, towards the end of March, the miracle happens and the decaying slum in which I live is transfigured.","But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned. The new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and inequality. These new movements, of course, grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their ideology. But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment.","Bir sonu olmayan ve kimsenin okumayaca\u011f\u0131, ama birisi i\xe7in yaz\u0131lm\u0131\u015f ve bununla bi\xe7imlenen bir mektup gibiydi g\xfcnl\xfck.","Meanwhile nothing happened, nothing ever happened.

All art is propaganda.","Crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity.","Do you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, it\'s in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the party is always right.","The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection \u2026 that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of fastening one\u2019s love upon other human individuals.","Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.","This is a political age. War, Fascism, concentration camps, rubber truncheons, atomic bombs, etc., are what we daily think about, and therefore to a great extent what we write about, even when we do not name them openly. We cannot help this. When you are on a sinking ship, your thoughts will be about sinking ships. But not only is our subject-matter narrowed, but our whole attitude towards literature is coloured by loyalties which we at least intermittently realise to be non-literary. I often have the feeling that even at the best of times literary criticism is fraudulent, since in the absence of any accepted standards whatever\u2014any external reference which can give meaning to the statement that such and such a book is \u201cgood or \u201cbad\u201d\u2014every literary judgement consists in trumping up a set of rules to justify an instinctive preference. One\u2019s real reaction to a book, when one has a reaction at all, is usually \u201cI like this book\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d and what follows is a rationalisation. But \u201cI like this book\u201d is not, I think, a non-literary reaction; the non-literary reaction is \u201cThis book is on my side, and therefore I must discover merits in it.\u201d Of course, when one praises a book for political reasons one may be emotionally sincere, in the sense that one does feel strong approval of it, but also it often happens that party solidarity demands a plain lie. Anyone used to reviewing books for political periodicals is well aware of this. In general, if you are writing for a paper that you are in agreement with, you sin by commission, and if for a paper of the opposite stamp, by omission.\u201d","We say that a man\'s dead when his heart stops and not before.

One is that nearly the whole of the Press is in the hands of a few very big capitalists who are interested in the continuance of capitalism and therefore in preventing the public from learning to think; the other is that peacetime newspapers live off advertisements for consumption goods, building societies, cosmetics and the like, and are therfore interested in maintaining a \\"sunshine mentality\\" which will induce people to spend money.

I merely assumed that \u201cMrs. Form\u201d was a stern disciplinarian who enjoyed beating people (somehow her appearance seemed to bear this out) and I had an immediate terrifying vision of her arriving for the occasion in full riding kit and armed with a hunting whip.

Here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime and astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator.","When nationalism first became a religion, the English looked at the map, and, noticing that their island lay very high in the Northern Hemisphere, evolved the pleasing theory that the further north you live the more virtuous you become. The histories I was given when I was a little boy started off by explaining in the na\xefvest way that a cold climate made people energetic while a hot one made them lazy, and hence the defeat of the Spanish Armada.","It\u2019s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn\u2019t only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take \u2018good\u2019, for instance. If you have a word like \u2018good\u2019, what need is there for a word like \u2018bad\u2019? \u2018Ungood\u2019 will do just as well\u2014better, because it\u2019s an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of \u201cgood, what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like \u2018excellent\u2019 and \u2018splendid\u2019 and all the rest of them? \u2018Plusgood\u2019 covers the meaning, or \u2018doubleplusgood\u2019 if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already, but in the final version of Newspeak there\u2019ll be nothing else. In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words\u2014in reality, only one word. Don\u2019t you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was B.B.\u2019s idea originally, of course,\u2019 he added as an afterthought.\u201d","Things will happen to you from which you could not recover, if you lived a thousand years.

He did not feel it. In this place you could not feel anything, except the pain and the foreknowledge of pain.

This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare.

Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.","Sometimes parties of men went spud-gathering in no-man\u2019s-land. About a mile to the right of us, where the lines were closer together, there was a patch of potatoes that was frequented both by the Fascists and ourselves. We went there in the daytime, they only at night, as it was commanded by our machine-guns. One night to our annoyance they turned out en masse and cleared up the whole patch. We discovered another patch further on, where there was practically no cover and you had to lift the potatoes lying on your belly\u2014a fatiguing job. If their machine-gunners spotted you, you had to flatten yourself out like a rat when it squirms under a door, with the bullets cutting up the clods a few yards behind you. It seemed worth it at the time. Potatoes were getting very scarce. If you got a sackful you could take them down to the cook-house and swap them for a water-bottleful of coffee. And","There was a direct intimate connection between chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood.

There were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it.

In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact.","Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy.

Our rulers, those of them who understand the issue, would probably prefer to hand over every square inch of the British Empire to Italy, Germany, and Japan than to see Socialism triumphant. It was easy to laugh at Fascism when we imagined that it was based on hysterical nationalism, because it seemed obvious that the Fascist states, each regarding itself as the chosen people and patriotic contra mundum, would clash with one another. But nothing of the kind is happening. Fascism is now an international movement, which means not only that the Fascist nations can combine for the purposes of loot, but that they are groping, perhaps only half consciously as yet, toward a world-system. For the vision of the totalitarian state there is being substituted the vision of the totalitarian world. As I pointed out earlier, the advance of machine-technique must lead ultimately to some form of collectivism, but that form need not necessarily be equalitarian; that is, it need not be Socialism. Pace the economists, it is quite possible to imagine a world-society, economically collectivist\u2013that is, with the profit principle eliminated\u2013but will all political, military, and educational power in the hands of a small caste of rulers and their bravos. That or something like it is the objective of Fascism.

The debased language that I have been discussing is in some ways very convenient.

The","Yet if one looks closely one sees that there is no essential difference between a beggar\u2019s livelihood and that of numberless respectable people. Beggars do not work, it is said; but, then, what is work? A navvy works by swinging a pick. An accountant works by adding up figures. A beggar works by standing out of doors in all weathers and getting varicose veins, chronic bronchitis, etc. It is a trade like any other; quite useless, of course\u2014but, then, many reputable trades are quite useless. And as a social type a beggar compares well with scores of others. He is honest compared with the sellers of most patent medicines, high-minded compared with a Sunday newspaper proprietor, amiable compared with a hire-purchase tout\u2014in short, a parasite, but a fairly harmless parasite. He seldom extracts more than a bare living from the community, and, what should justify him according to our ethical ideas, he pays for it over and over in suffering. I do not think there is anything about a beggar that sets him in a different class from other people, or gives most modern men the right to despise him.","To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone\u2014to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone:","But that was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought to take it. He did not feel it.","One cannot imagine the average Englishman deliberately turning parasite, and this national character does not necessarily change because a man is thrown out of work.

I am not saying, of course, that most tramps are ideal characters; I am only saying that they are ordinary human beings, and that if they are worse than other people it is the result and not the cause of their way of life.","If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.","We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.

In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way.

Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.","Housman would not have appealed so deeply to the people who were young in 1920 if it had not been for another strain in him, and that was his blasphemous, antinomian, \\"cynical\\" strain. The fight that always occurs between the generations was exceptionally bitter at the end of the Great War; this was partly due to the war itself, and partly it was an indirect result of the Russian Revolution, but an intellectual struggle was in any case due at about that date. Owing probably to the ease and security of life in England, which even the war hardly disturbed, many people whose ideas were formed in the \'eighties or earlier had carried them quite unmodified into the nineteen-twenties. Meanwhile, so far as the younger generation was concerned, the official beliefs were dissolving like sand-castles. The slump in religious belief, for instance, was spectacular. For several years the old\u2014young antagonism took on a quality of real hatred. What was left of the war generation had crept out of the massacre to find their elders still bellowing the slogans of 1914, and a slightly younger generation of boys were writhing under dirty-minded celibate schoolmasters. It was to these that Housman appealed, with his implied sexual revolt and his personal grievance against God. He was patriotic, it was true, but in a harmless old-fashioned way, to the tune of red coats and \\"God save the Queen\\" rather than steel helmets and \\"Hang the Kaiser.\\" And he was satisfyingly anti-Christian\u2014he stood for a kind of bitter, defiant paganism, a conviction that life is short and the gods are against you, which exactly fitted the prevailing mood of the young; and all in charming fragile verse that was composed almost entirely of words of one syllable.","Si quieres hacerte una idea de c\xf3mo ser\xe1 el futuro, fig\xfarate una bota aplastando un rostro humano... incesantemente.","Bir domuz ile ba\u015fka bir hayvan yolda kar\u015f\u0131la\u015ft\u0131klar\u0131nda \xf6teki hayvan kenara \xe7ekilerek domuza yol verecek ve b\xfct\xfcn domuzlar Pazar g\xfcnleri kuyruklar\u0131na ye\u015fil kurdele takma ayr\u0131laca\u011f\u0131na sahip olacaklard\u0131.","El ataque directo y consciente contra la honradez intelectual procede de los propios intelectuales.","February your grandmother!","\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u061b \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0628\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629\u061b \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0644 \u0642\u0648\u0629.","The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one is sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of fastening one\'s love upon other human individuals. No doubt alcohol, tobacco, and so forth, are things that a saint must avoid, but sainthood is also a thing that human beings must avoid. There is an obvious retort to this, but one should be wary about making it. In this yogi-ridden age, it is too readily assumed that \\"non-attachment\\" is not only better than a full acceptance of earthly life, but that the ordinary man only rejects it because it is too difficult: in other words, that the average human being is a failed saint. It is doubtful whether this is true. Many people genuinely do not wish to be saints, and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human beings. If one could follow it to its psychological roots, one would, I believe, find that the main motive for \\"non-attachment\\" is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work. But it is not necessary here to argue whether the otherworldly or the humanistic ideal is \\"higher.\\" The point is that they are incompatible. One must choose between God and Man, and all \\"radicals\\" and \\"progressives,\\" from the mildest Liberal to the most extreme Anarchist, have in effect chosen Man","War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.","To die hating them, that was freedom","But unfortunately you get no further by merely wishing class-distinctionsaway. More exactly, it is necessary to wish them away, but your wish has noefficacy unless you grasp what it involves.

It is easy for me to say that I want toget rid of class-distinctions, but nearly everything I think and do is a result ofclass-distinctions. All my notions \u2013notions of good and evil, of pleasant and unpleasant,of funny and serious, of ugly and beautiful\u2013are essentially middle-classnotions; my taste in books and food and clothes, my sense of honour, my tablemanners, my turns of speech, my accent, even the characteristic movements ofmy body, are the products of a special kind of upbringing and a special nicheabout half-way up the social hierarchy.","To prevent us from shooting each other in the darkness white armlets would be worn.

In a healthy world there would be no demand for tinned food, aspirins, gramophones, gas-pipe chairs, machine guns, daily newspapers, telephones, motor-cars, etc. etc.; and on the other hand there would be a constant demand for the things the machine cannot produce. But meanwhile the machine is here, and its corrupting effects are almost irresistible. One inveighs against it, but one goes on using it. Even a bare-arse savage, given the change, will learn the vices of civilisation within a few months. Mechanisation leads to the decay of taste, the decay of taste leads to demand for machine-made articles and hence to more mechanisation, and so a vicious circle is established.","War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair.","Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being non-existent persons.

Ou mais exactamente, chamando-lhe trotskista.\u201d","What I have most wanted to do throughout the past ten years is to make political writing into an art. My starting point is always a feeling of partisanship, a sense of injustice. When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, \u2018I am going to produce a work of art\u2019. I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing. [...]My book about the Spanish civil war, Homage to Catalonia, is of course a frankly political book, but in the main it is written with a certain detachment and regard for form. I did try very hard in it to tell the whole truth without violating my literary instincts. But among other things it contains a long chapter, full of newspaper quotations and the like, defending the Trotskyists who were accused of plotting with Franco. Clearly such a chapter, which after a year or two would lose its interest for any ordinary reader, must ruin the book. A critic whom I respect read me a lecture about it. \u2018Why did you put in all that stuff?\u2019 he said. \u2018You\'ve turned what might have been a good book into journalism.\u2019 What he said was true, but I could not have done otherwise. I happened to know, what very few people in England had been allowed to know, that innocent men were being falsely accused. If I had not been angry about that I should never have written the book.","For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realise that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away.","I have had a big experience of body vermin of various kinds, and for sheer beastliness the louse beats everything I have encountered. Other insects, mosquitoes for instance, make you suffer more, but at least they aren\u2019t resident vermin. The human louse somewhat resembles a tiny lobster, and he lives chiefly in your trousers. Short of burning all your clothes there is no known way of getting rid of him. Down the seams of your trousers he lays his glittering white eggs, like tiny grains of rice, which hatch out and breed families of their own at horrible speed. I think the pacifists might find it helpful to illustrate their pamphlets with enlarged photographs of lice. Glory of war, indeed! In war all soldiers are lousy, at least when it is warm enough. The men who fought at Verdun, at Waterloo, at Flodden, at Senlac, at Thermopylae\u2014every one of them had lice crawling over his testicles.","La historia era un palimpsesto, borrado y reescrito tantas veces como fuese necesario.","The command of the old despotisms was \\"Thou shalt not\\". The command of the totalitarians was \\"Thou shalt\\". Our command is \\"Thou are\\".","It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.","K\xfc\xe7\xfck kurallara uyarsan, b\xfcy\xfck kurallar\u0131 \xe7i\u011fneyebilirdin.","Four legs good, two legs bad.\u2019 This, he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism.","In any town in India the European Club is the spiritual citadel, the real seat of the British power, the Nirvana for which native officials and millionaires pine in vain.","A known fact may be so unbearable that it is habitually pushed aside and not allowed to enter into logical processes, or on the other hand it may enter into every calculation and yet never be admitted as a fact, even in one\u2019s own mind. Every nationalist is haunted by the belief that the past can be altered. He spends part of his time in a fantasy world in which things happen as they should \u2013 in which, for example, the Spanish Armada was a success or the Russian Revolution was crushed in 1918 \u2013 and he will transfer fragments of this world to the history books whenever possible. Much of the propagandist writing of our time amounts to plain forgery. Material facts are suppressed, dates altered, quotations removed from their context and doctored so as to change their meaning. Events which, it is felt, ought not to have happened are left unmentioned and ultimately denied.fn6 In 1927 Chiang Kai-Shek boiled hundreds of Communists alive, and yet within ten years he had become one of the heroes of the Left. The realignment of world politics had brought him into the anti-Fascist camp, and so it was felt that the boiling of the Communists \u2018didn\u2019t count\u2019, or perhaps had not happened.","We are the dead, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not dead yet,\u201d said Julia prosaically. \u201cNot physically. Six months, a year\u2014five years, conceivably. I am afraid of death. You are young, so presumably you\u2019re more afraid of it than I am. Obviously we shall put it off as long as we can. But it makes very little difference. So long as human beings stay human, death and life are the same thing.\u201d","Moreover, to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of the kind that is practised today would have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards. While wars could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.","The Burmese say that when you kill one of these birds they vomit, meaning to say, \\"Look, here is all I possess, and I\'ve taken nothing of yours. Why do you kill me?","The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies \\"something not desirable\\".","In theory I rather admire the Spaniards for not sharing our Northern time-neurosis; but unfortunately I share it myself.","Our civilisation is haunted by the notion that the quickest way of doing anything is invariably the best.","Winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and filled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few drops from another bottle with a quill through the cork. It was saccharine flavoured with cloves, the speciality of the caf\xe9.","I noticed how the attitude of women varies with a man\'s clothes. When a badly dressed man passes them they shudder away from him with a quite frank movement of disgust, as though he were a dead cat. Clothes are very powerful things.","It is a commonplace that the Christian Heaven, as usually portrayed, would attract nobody.","It is difficult when you pass that way, especially when you are peacefully recovering from sea-sickness with the plush cushions of a boat-train carriage under your bum, to believe that anything is really happening anywhere. Earthquakes in Japan, famines in China, revolutions in Mexico? Don\'t worry, the milk will be on the doorstep tomorrow morning, the New Statesman will come out on Friday.","The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even","All the best matadors were Fascists.","Raras vezes falava, e em geral quando o fazia era para emitir uma observa\xe7\xe3o c\xednica \u2014 para dizer, por exemplo, que Deus lhe dera uma cauda para espantar as moscas, e no entanto seria mais do seu agrado n\xe3o ter nem a cauda nem as moscas.","Los mejores libros, comprendi\xf3, son los que te cuentan lo que ya sab\xedas.","He accepted everything. The past was alterable.","Lo siniestro de la censura literaria en Inglaterra es que en su mayor parte es voluntaria. Las ideas impopulares pueden silenciarse, y los hechos inconvenientes mantenerse en la oscuridad, sin necesidad de prohibici\xf3n oficial.","The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realisable. Every new political theory, by whatever name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years\u2014imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages and the deportation of whole populations\u2014not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive.","For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable\u2014what then?","For long periods the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves, or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again.","But this sense of guilt and inevitable failure was balanced by something else: that is, the instinct to survive. Even a creature that is weak, ugly, cowardly, smelly and in no way justifiable still wants to stay alive and be happy after its own fashion. I could not invert the existing scale of values, or turn myself into a success, but I could accept my failure and make the best of it. I could resign myself to being what I was, and then endeavour to survive on those terms.","Everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal.","Georges Kopp, on his periodical tours of inspection, was quite frank with us. \'This is not a war,\' he used to say, \'it is a comic opera with an occasional death.","It\'s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn\'t only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take \'good,\' for instance. If you have a word like \'good,\' what need is there for a word like \'bad\'? \'Ungood\' will do just as well\u2014better, because it\'s an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of \'good,\' what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like \'excellent\' and \'splendid\' and all the rest of them? \'Plusgood\' covers the meaning, or \'doubleplusgood\' if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already, but in the final version of Newspeak there\'ll be nothing else. In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words\u2014in reality, only one word. Don\'t you see the beauty of that, Winston?","It was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were also very much the same--everywhere, all over the world, hundreds or thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another\'s existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the same--people who had never learned to think but were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world. \u2015 George Orwell, 1984\u201d","Oranges and lemons,\u2019 say the bells of St Clement\u2019s, \u2018You owe me three farthings,\u2019 say the bells of St Martin\u2019s, \u2018When will you pay me?\u2019 say the bells of Old Bailey, \u2018When I grow rich,\u2019 say the bells of Shoreditch. \xa0 \u2018You","Up here, in the hills round Zaragoza, it was simply the mingled boredom and discomfort of stationary warfare. A life as uneventful as a city clerk\'s, and almost as regular. Sentry-go, patrols, digging; digging, patrols, sentry-go. On every hill-top. Fascist or Loyalist, a knot of ragged, dirty men shivering round their flag and trying to keep warm. And all day and night the meaningless bullets wandering across the empty valleys and only by some rare improbable chance getting home on a human body.","Fear of the mob is a superstitious fear. It is based on the idea that there is some mysterious, fundamental difference between rich and poor, as though they were two different races, like Negroes and white men. But in reality there is no such difference. The mass of the rich and the poor are differentiated by their incomes and nothing else, and the average millionaire is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit. Change places, and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief?","Y\xf6netmek ve y\xf6netimini s\xfcrekli k\u0131lmak istiyorsan, ger\xe7eklik duygusunu yolundan \xe7\u0131karacaks\u0131n. \xc7\xfcnk\xfc y\xf6netmenin s\u0131rr\u0131, bir yandan kendinin yan\u0131lmazl\u0131\u011f\u0131na inan\u0131rken, bir yandan da ge\xe7mi\u015fteki hatalar\u0131ndan ders \xe7\u0131karabilmektedir.","And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one\'s own personality.","That was what the Army did to you. It turned you into an imitation gentleman and gave you a fixed idea that there\u2019d always be a bit of money coming from somewhere.","He would read King Lear and forget this filthy century.","If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you understand that you are alone? You are outside history, you are non-existent.","Collectivism leads to concentration camps, leader worship and war.","The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a \'real\' world where \'real\' things happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of anything, save though out own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.","If there is any hope, it lies in the proles","Perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface, its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing iniquity.","The history books say that life before the Revolution was completely different from what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty\u2014worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of them hadn\u2019t even boots on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands\u2014the capitalists, they were called\u2014who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was to own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they rode about in motor cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne, they wore top hats\u2014","One thing, I thought as I drove down the hill, I\u2019m finished with this notion of getting back into the past. What\u2019s the good of trying to revisit the scenes of your boyhood? They don\u2019t exist. Coming up for air! But there isn\u2019t any air. The dustbin that we\u2019re in reaches up to the stratosphere.","For it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely. In no other way could the ancient cycle be broken. If human equality is to be forever averted\u2014if the High, as we have called them, are to keep their places permanently\u2014then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity.","Normalno\u015b\u0107 nie jest kwesti\u0105 statystyki","He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices\u2013women\u2019s voices\u2013had burst from a side-street a little way ahead. It was a great formidable cry of anger and despair, a deep loud \u2018Oh-o-o-o-oh!\u2019 that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. It\u2019s started! he had thought. A riot! The proles are breaking loose at last! When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. But at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy things, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get. Now the supply had unexpectedly given out. The successful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another\u2019s hands. For a moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off. Winston watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered?","It was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were also very much the same\u2014everywhere, all over the world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another\u2019s existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the same\u2014people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world.","All people who work with their hands are party invisible, and the more important the work they do, the more invisible they are.","Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer in Hides and Bone-Meal. Kennels Supplied.","Looking back through my work, I see that it is invariably where I lacked a political purpose that I wrote lifeless books and was betrayed into purple passages, sentences without meaning, decorative adjectives and humbug generally.","If he were allowed to contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies.","Don\u2019t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we\u2019re not far from that point. But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. Even now, of course, there\u2019s no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime. It\u2019s merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control. But in the end there won\u2019t be any need even for that. The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak, he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. \u201cHas it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?\u201d","ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUALBUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MOREEQUAL THAN OTHERS","Merely to be alone, not to be beaten or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was completely satisfying.","Dickens seems to have succeeded in attacking everybody and antagonizing nobody.","I thought it idiotic that people fighting for their lives should have separate parties","Orang mengorbankan diri mereka demi komunitas fragmentaris \u2013 bangsa, ras, keyakinan, kelas \u2013 dan baru menyadari bahwa mereka bukan individu ketika mereka disongsong peluru.","She also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to accept the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her.","To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.","Isn\u2019t it queer how we go through life, always thinking that the things we want to do are the things that can\u2019t be done?","The other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did not at first give him much help. At heart, each of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn Jones\u2019s misfortune to his own advantage.","What writers, artists, scientists and philosophers say today is indicative of future rather than current developments","And the people under the sky were also very much the same\u2014everywhere, all over the world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another\u2019s existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the same\u2014people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world.","Dovunque, in tutto il mondo, centinaia o migliaia di milioni di individui, tutti eguali, ignari dell\u2019esistenza di altri individui, tenuti separati da mura di odio e di bugie, eppure quasi gli stessi.","Pensou no telecr\xe3, nos ouvidos sempre \xe0 escuta.

By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed.","Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?","But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realise that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away.

You discover boredom and mean complications and the beginnings of hunger, but you also discover the great redeeming feature of poverty: the fact that it annihilates the future. Within certain limits, it is actually true that the less money you have, the less you worry. When you have a hundred francs in the world you are liable to the most craven panics. When you have only three francs you are quite indifferent; for three francs will feed you till tomorrow, and you cannot think further than that. You are bored, but you are not afraid.

Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree.","Often there is a seeming truce between the humanist and the religious believer, but in fact their attitudes cannot be reconciled: one must choose between this world and the next.

He was, and still is, quite incapable of understanding that nationalism, religious bigotry and feudal loyalty are far more powerful forces than what he himself would describe as sanity.","Doublethink lies at the very heart of Ingsoc, since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty.","His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them; to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy; to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.","To begin with, it has nothing to do with archaism, with the salvaging of obsolete words and turns of speech, or with the setting-up of a \\"standard English\\" which must never be departed from. On the contrary, it is especially concerned with the scrapping of every word or idiom which has outworn its usefulness. It has nothing to do with correct grammar and syntax, which are of no importance so long as one makes one\'s meaning clear, or with the avoidance of Americanisms, or with having what is called \\"good prose style.\\" On the other hand it is not concerned with fake simplicity and the attempt to make written English colloquial. Nor does it even imply in every case preferring the Saxon word to the Latin one, though it does imply using the fewest and shortest words that will cover one\'s meaning. What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way about. In prose the worst thing one can do with words is to surrender to them. When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing you have been visualizing, you probably hunt about till you find the exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one\'s meaning as clear as one can through pictures or sensations. Afterwards one can choose--not simply accept--the phrases that will best cover the meaning, and then switch round and decide what impression one\'s words are likely to make on another person. This last effort of the mind cuts out all stale or mixed images, all prefabricated phrases, needless repetitions, and humbug and vagueness generally.","World-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be impossible.","five chief beatitudes of the pukka sahib, namely: Keeping up our prestige, The firm hand (without the velvet glove), We white men must hang together, Give them an inch and they\u2019ll take an ell, and Esprit de corps.","The mass of the rich and the poor are differentiated by their incomes and nothing else, and the average millionaire is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit. Change places, and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Everyone who has mixed on equal terms with the poor knows this quite well. But the trouble is that intelligent, cultivated people, the very people who might be expected to have liberal opinions, never do mix with the poor. For what do the majority of educated people know about poverty?","We all rail against class-distinctions, but very few people seriously want to abolish them. Here you come upon the important fact that every revolutionary opinion draws part of its strength from a secret conviction that nothing can be changed.","But of course it was an American paper. The Americans always go one better on any kinds of beastliness, whether it is ice-cream soda, racketeering, or theosophy.","Queer, the affection you can feel for a stranger! It was as though his spirit and mine had momentarily succeeded in bridging the gulf of language and tradition and meeting in utter intimacy. I hoped he liked me as well as I liked him. But I also knew that to retain my first impression of him I must not see him again; and needless to say I never did see him again.","Secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment of self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case, each of the three superstates is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for labor power.","Of course the post-war development of cheap luxuries has been a very fortunate thing for our rulers. It is quite likely that fish-and-chips, art-silk stockings, tinned salmon, cut-price chocolate (five two-ounce bars for sixpence), the movies, the radio, strong tea, and the Football Pools have between them averted revolution. Therefore we are some-times told that the whole thing is an astute manoeuvre by the governing class\u2013a sort of \'bread and circuses\' business\u2013to hold the unemployed down. What I have seen of our governing class does not convince me that they have that much intelligence.

But in any case, though the ugliness of industrialism is the most obvious thing about it and the thing every newcomer exclaims against, I doubt whether it is centrally important. And perhaps it is not even desirable, industrialism being what it is, that it should learn to disguise itself as something else. As Mr Aldous Huxley has truly remarked, a dark Satanic mill ought to look like a dark Satanic mill and not like the temple of mysterious and splendid gods. Moreover, even in the worst of the industrial towns one sees a great deal that is not ugly in the narrow aesthetic sense. A belching chimney or a stinking slum is repulsive chiefly because it implies warped lives and ailing children. Look at it from a purely aesthetic standpoint and it may have a certain macabre appeal. I find that anything outrageously strange generally ends by fascinating me even when I abominate it.","Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.

Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare. The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labor. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labor power without producing anything that can be consumed.","As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy.

Most people can get a job of sorts, even at the worst of times. The trouble was that by about 1930 there was no activity, except perhaps scientific research, the arts and left-wing politics, that a thinking person could believe in. The debunking of Western civilisation had reached its climax and \u201cdisillusionment was immensely widespread. Who now could take it for granted to go through life in the ordinary middle-class way, as a soldier, a clergyman, a stockbroker, an Indian Civil Servant or what-not? And how many of the values by which our grandfathers lived could now be taken seriously? Patriotism, religion, the Empire, the family, the sanctity of marriage, the Old School Tie, birth, breeding, honour, discipline\u2014anyone of ordinary education could turn the whole lot of them inside out in three minutes. But what do you achieve, after all, by getting rid of such primal things as patriotism and religion? You have not necessarily got rid of the need for something to believe in.\u201d","Everything was very blurry. There must have been about two minutes during which I assumed that I was killed. And that too was interesting--I mean it is interesting to know what your thoughts would be at such a time. My first thought, conventionally enough, was for my wife. My second was a violent resentment at having to leave this world which, when all is said and done, suits me so well. I had time to feel this very vividly. the stupid mischance infuriated me. The meaningless of it! To be bumped off, not even in battle, but in this stale corner of the trenches, thanks to a moment\'s carelessness! I thought too, of the man who shot me--wondered what he was like, whether he was a Spaniard or a foreigner, whether he knew he had got me, and so forth. I could not feel any resentment against him. I reflected that as he was a Fascist I would have killed him if I could, but that if he had been taken prisoner and brought before me at this moment I would merely have congratulated him on his good shooting. It may be, though that if you were really dying your thoughts would be quite different.","Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you mad.","This is war!

With all its injustices, England is still the land of habeas corpus, and the overwhelming majority of English people have no experience of violence or illegality. If you have grown up in that sort of atmosphere it is not at all easy to imagine what a despotic r\xe9gime is like. Nearly all the dominant writers of the \u2019thirties belonged to the soft-boiled emancipated middle class and were too young to have effective memories of the Great War. To people of that kind such things as purges, secret police, summary executions, imprisonment without trial, etc., etc., are too remote to be terrifying. They can swallow totalitarianism because they have no experience of anything except liberalism. Look, for instance, at this extract from Mr. Auden\u2019s poem Spain","It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but always against one\'s own body.","WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH","The aim of the High is to remain where they are.

From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters.","This process of con-tinuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, butto books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films,sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs\u2014to every kind of lit-erature or documentation which might conceivably holdany political or ideological significance. Day by day andalmost minute by minute the past was brought up to date.","Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly.","In a world where everything could be done by machinery, everything would be done by machinery.","To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies\u2014all this is indispensably necessary. Even","But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it ultimately make?","The older kind of Socialist, who had been trained to fight against something called \u2018class privilege\u2019, assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent. He did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived, whereas adoptive organisations such as the Catholic Church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years. The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living.

He must be cut off from the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries.","Middle-class people are fond of saying that the miners would not wash themselves properly even if they could, but this is nonsense, as is shown by the fact that where pithead baths exist practically all the men use them.","A modern literary intellectual lives and writes in constant dread\u2014not, indeed, of public opinion in the wider sense, but of public opinion within his own group.","A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement before the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents produced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a skeptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline. The first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to young children, is called, in Newspeak, crimestop. Crimestop means the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. Crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one\u2019s own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body. Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the Party is not infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts. The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink.","What is concerned here is not the morale of the masses, whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly.","Meanwhile the thinking person, by intellect usually left-wing but by temperament often right-wing, hovers at the gate of the Socialist fold.","By 1937 the whole of the intelligentsia was mentally at war. Left-wing thought had narrowed down to \u201canti-Fascism, i.e., to a negative, and a torrent of hate-literature directed against Germany and the politicians supposedly friendly to Germany was pouring from the Press. The thing that, to me, was truly frightening about the war in Spain was not such violence as I witnessed, nor even the party feuds behind the lines, but the immediate reappearance in left-wing circles of the mental atmosphere of the Great War. The very people who for twenty years had sniggered over their own superiority to war hysteria were the ones who rushed straight back into the mental slum of 1915. All the familiar war-time idiocies, spy-hunting, orthodoxy-sniffing (Sniff, sniff. Are you a good anti-Fascist?), the retailing of incredible atrocity-stories, came back into vogue as though the intervening years had never happened. Before the end of the Spanish war, and even before Munich, some of the better of the left-wing writers were beginning to squirm. Neither Auden nor, on the whole, Spender wrote about the Spanish war in quite the vein that was expected of them. Since then there has been a change of feeling and much dismay and confusion, because the actual course of events has made nonsense of the left-wing orthodoxy of the last few years. But then it did not need very great acuteness to see that much of it was nonsense from the start. There is no certainty, therefore, that the next orthodoxy to emerge will be any better than the last. On\u201d","Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question, \u201cWas life better before the Revolution than it is now? would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister\u2019s face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago; but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and written records were falsified\u2014when that happened, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.\u201d","The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The subsidiary reason is that the Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut off from the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising. But by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the Party. It is not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in all cases right. It is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted. For to change one\u2019s mind, or even one\u2019s policy, is a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasia or Eastasia (whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then that country must always have been the enemy. And if the facts say otherwise, then the facts must be altered. Thus history is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day falsification of the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is","Si la libertad significa algo, es el derecho a decirles a los dem\xe1s lo que no quieren o\xedr.","\u064a\u0627\u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0645\u0627\u0647\u0648 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u062a\u062d\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0633","For money buys all virtues.

War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.","Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party\u2014an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it.","I wasn\u2019t a highbrow any longer.

And this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historic change.

Perhaps a classless society doesn\'t mean a beatific state of affairs in which we shall all go on behaving exactly as before except that there will be no class-hatred and no snobbishness; perhaps it means a bleak world in which all our ideals, our codes, our tastes\u2013our \'ideology\', in fact\u2013will have no meaning.

There, at least, the ruling groups are not dependent on popular favour and can utter the truth crudely and brutally. Goering could say \u2018Guns before butter\u2019, while his democratic opposite numbers had to wrap the same sentiment up in hundreds of hypocritical words.Actually, however, the avoidance of reality is much the same everywhere, and has much the same consequences. The Russian people were taught for years that they were better off than everybody else, and propaganda posters showed Russian families sitting down to an abundant meal while the proletariat of other countries starved in the gutter. Meanwhile the workers in the western countries were so much better off than those of the U.S.S.R. that non-contact between Soviet citizens and outsiders had to be a guiding principle of policy. Then, as a result of the war, millions of ordinary Russians penetrated far into Europe, and when they return home the original avoidance of reality will inevitably be paid for in frictions of various kinds. The Germans and the Japanese lost the war quite largely because their rulers were unable to see facts which were plain to any dispassionate eye.To see what is in front of one\'s nose needs a constant struggle.","You had to live\u2014did live, from habit that became instinct\u2014in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinised.","I had fallen into a chair, weakly snivelling. I remember that this was the only time throughout my boyhood when a beating actually reduced me to tears, and curiously enough I was not even now crying because of the pain. The second beating had not hurt very much either. Fright and shame seemed to have anesthetised me. I was crying partly because I felt that this was expected of me, partly from genuine repentance, but partly also because of a deeper grief which is peculiar to childhood and not easy to convey: a sense of desolate loneliness and helplessness, of being locked up not only in a hostile world but in a world of good and evil where the rules were such that it was actually not possible for me to keep them. I knew that bed wetting was (a) wicked and (b) outside my control. The second fact I was personally aware of, and the first I did not question. It was possible, therefore, to commit a sin without knowing that you committed it, without wanting to commit it, and without being able to avoid it.

To get one beating, and then to get another and far fiercer one on top of it, for being so unwise as to show that the first had not hurt\u2014that was quite natural. The gods are jealous, and when you have good fortune you should conceal it. The other is that I accepted the broken riding crop as my own crime. I can still recall my feeling as I saw the handle lying on the carpet\u2014the feeling of having done an ill-bred clumsy thing, and ruined an expensive object. I had broken it: so Sim told me, and so I believed.

In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an airplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.","Eight hundred people, possibly, are murdered every year in Burma, they matter nothing; but the murder of a white man is a monstrosity, a sacrilege.","a bookshop is one of the few places where you can hang about for a long time without spending any money.","Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been re-painted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered.

These new movements, of course, grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their ideology.

Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life \u2014 snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc. \u2014 had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money \u2014 tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master. Of course such a state of affairs could not last. It was simply a temporary and local phase in an enormous game that is being played over the whole surface of the earth. But it lasted long enough to have its effect upon anyone who experienced it. However much one cursed at the time, one realized afterwards that one had been in contact with something strange and valuable. One had been in a community where hope was more normal than apathy or cynicism, where the word \u2018comrade\u2019 stood for comradeship and not, as in most countries, for humbug. One had breathed the air of equality. I am well aware that it is now the fashion to deny that Socialism has anything to do with equality. In every country in the world a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy \u2018proving\u2019 that Socialism means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite different from this. The thing that attracts ordinary men to Socialism and makes them willing to risk their skins for it, the \u2018mystique\u2019 of Socialism, is the idea of equality; to the vast majority of people Socialism means a classless society, or it means nothing at all. And it was here that those few months in the militia were valuable to me. For the Spanish militias, while they lasted, were a sort of microcosm of a classless society. In that community where no one was on the make, where there was a shortage of everything but no privilege and no boot-licking, one got, perhaps, a crude forecast of what the opening stages of Socialism might be like. And, after all, instead of disillusioning me it deeply attracted me. The effect was to make my desire to see Socialism established much more actual than it had been before. Partly, perhaps, this was due to the good luck of being among Spaniards, who, with their innate decency and their ever-present Anarchist tinge, would make even the opening stages of Socialism tolerable if they had the chance.","Wydaje ci si\u0119, \u017ce istnieje co\u015b takiego jak natura ludzka, kt\xf3ra oburzona tym, co robimy, zwr\xf3ci si\u0119 przeciwko nam.

He may be a positive or a negative nationalist \u2013 that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating \u2013 but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units, and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the up-grade and some hated rival is on the down-grade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest, and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him. Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self- deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty, but he is also \u2013 since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself \u2013 unshakably certain of being in the right.","\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0647\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645  \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0647 \u0647\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0647  \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0644 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0629","All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals.

The ordinary class-division of society haddisappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one ownedanyone else as his master. Of course such a state of affairs could not last. It was simply a temporary and local phase in an enormous game that is being played over thewhole surface of the earth. But it lasted long enough to have its effect upon anyonewho experienced it. However much one cursed at the time, one realized afterwardsthat one had been in contact with something strange and valuable. One had beenin a community where hope was more normal than apathy or cynicism, where theword \u2019comrade\u2019 stood for comradeship and not, as in most countries, for humbug.One had breathed the air of equality. I am well aware that it is now the fashion todeny that Socialism has anything to do with equality. In every country in the world ahuge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy \u2019proving\u2019 that Socialismmeans no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite different from this. The thingthat attracts ordinary men to Socialism and makes them willing to risk their skins forit, the \u2019mystique\u2019 of Socialism, is the idea of equality; to the vast majority of peopleSocialism means a classless society, or it means nothing at all.","But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also be wrong.","Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party.","In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Things ... can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness\u2026. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them.","What was happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years ago. The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second had been the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words, and now from words to actions. The last step was something that would happen in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was contained in the beginning. But it was frightening: or, more exactly, it was like a foretaste of death, like being a little less alive.","Todo se difuminaba en la niebla. El pasado hab\xeda sido borrado, se hab\xeda olvidado que hab\xeda sido borrado y de ese modo la mentira se convert\xeda en verdad.","They could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.","And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed \u2014 if all records told the same tale \u2014 then the lie passed into history and became truth. \u2018Who controls the past,\u2019 ran the Party slogan, \u2018controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.","Unfortunately it is nowadays the fashion to pretend that the glass is penetrable. Of course everyone knows that class-prejudice exists, but at the same time everyone claims that he, in some mysterious way, is exempt from it. Snob-bishness is one of those vices which we can discern in every- one else but\' never in ourselves. Not only the croyant et pratiquant Socialist, but every \'intellectual\' takes it as a matter of course that he at least is outside the class-racket; he, unlike his neighbours, can see through the absurdity of wealth, ranks, titles, etc., etc. \'I\'m not a snob\' is nowadays a kind of universal credo. Who is there who has not jeered at the House of Lords, the military caste, the Royal Family, the public schools, the huntin\' and shootin\' people, the old ladies in Cheltenham boarding-houses, the horrors of \'county\' society, and the social hierarchy generally? To do so has become an automatic gesture.","\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0647\u0631\u0628 \u0644\u0643 , \u0623\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0633\u0648\u0649 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u062a\u064a\u0645\u064a\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u062c\u0645\u062c\u0645\u062a\u0643","\u200bSava\u015f, halk kitlelerini fazlas\u0131yla rahata erdirecek, dolay\u0131s\u0131yla uzun s\xfcrede kafalar\u0131n\u0131n fazlas\u0131yla \xe7al\u0131\u015fmas\u0131n\u0131 sa\u011flayacak ara\xe7 gere\xe7 ve donat\u0131m\u0131 parampar\xe7a etmenin, stratosfere yollaman\u0131n ya da denizin dibine g\xf6ndermenin bir yoludur.","If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face\u2014forever.","No real revolutionary has ever been an internationalist.","You did not have friends nowadays, you had comrades; but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others.","The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable.
