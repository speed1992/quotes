Remorse is cureless, \u2014 the disease Not even God can heal; For \'t is his institution, \u2014 The complement of hell.","No rack can torture me,My soul\'s at libertyBehind this mortal boneThere knits a bolder oneYou cannot prick with saw,Nor rend with scymitar.Two bodies therefore be;Bind one, and one will flee.The eagle of his nestNo easier divestAnd gain the sky,Than mayest thou,Except thyself may beThine enemy;Captivity is consciousness,So\'s liberty.","A precious, mouldering pleasure \u2018t isTo meet an antique book,In just the dress his century wore;A privilege, I think,","Non parlavo mai - se non sollecitata. In quei casi - brevemente - a voce bassa.Non mi riusciva di vivere nella confusione. Mi vergognavo del chiasso.","XVI: A BOOK. There is no frigate like a bookTo take us lands away,Nor any coursers like a pageOf prancing poetry.This traverse may the poorest takeWithout oppress of toll;How frugal is the chariot That bears a human soul!","If you were coming in the fall, I\'d brush the summer by With half a smile and half a spurn, As housewives do a fly. If I could see you in a year, I\'d wind the months in balls, And put them each in separate drawers, Until their time befalls. If only centuries delayed, I\'d count them on my hand, Subtracting till my fingers dropped Into Van Diemen\'s land. If certain, when this life was out, That yours and mine should be, I\'d toss it yonder like a rind, And taste eternity.","Better an ignis fatuusThan no illume at all -","I\'m Nobody! Who are you?Are you \u2013 Nobody \u2013 too?Then there\'s a pair of us!Don\'t tell! they\'d advertise \u2013 you know!How dreary \u2013 to be \u2013 Somebody!How public \u2013 like a Frog \u2013To tell one\'s name \u2013 the livelong June \u2013To an admiring Bog!","I\'m Nobody! Who are you? Are you\u2014Nobody\u2014Too?","XXX. Faith is a fine inventionFor gentlemen who see;But microscopes are prudent In an emergency!","You left me, sweet, two legacies,\u2014 A legacy of love A Heavenly Father would content, Had he the offer of; You left me boundaries of pain Capacious as the sea, Between eternity and time, Your consciousness and me. \u2014Emily Dickinson","Oh the Earth was made for lovers","[ ... ] Pero con quien cavila mientras el resto no deja de parlotear, con esta persona soy cautelosa.Temo que sea una gran persona.","To pile like Thunder to its close, Then crumble grand away, While everything created hid \u2014 This would be Poetry: Or Love, \u2014 the two coeval came \u2014 We both and neither prove, Experience either, and consume \u2014 For none see God and live."]')}}]);
