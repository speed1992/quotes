The next step is to fascinate fools and muzzle the intelligent, by emotional excitement on the one hand and terrorism on the other.","If an opinion contrary to your own makes you angry, that is a sign that you are subconsciously aware of having no good reason for thinking as you do.","Men are born ignorant, not stupid. They are made stupid by education.","Collective fear stimulates herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd.","Fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.","The key to happiness is accepting one unpleasant reality every day.","The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.","The most valuable things in life are not measured in monetary terms. The really important things are not houses and lands, stocks and bonds, automobiles and real state, but friendships, trust, confidence, empathy, mercy, love and faith.","Most of the greatest evils that man has inflicted upon man have come through people feeling quite certain about something which, in fact, was false.","Even when the experts all agree, they may well be mistaken.","One should as a rule respect public opinion in so far as is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny.","The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation.","Neither a man nor a crowd nor a nation can be trusted to act humanely or to think sanely under the influence of a great fear.","A stupid man\'s report of what a clever man says can never be accurate, because he unconsciously translates what he hears into something he can understand.","Religion is based ... mainly upon fear ... fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death.  Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand.  My own view on religion is that of Lucretius.  I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race.","A smile happens in a flash, but its memory can last a lifetime.","Love is wise; hatred is foolish. In this world, which is getting more and more closely interconnected, we have to learn to tolerate each other, we have to learn to put up with the fact that some people say things that we don\'t like. We can only live together in that way. But if we are to live together, and not die together, we must learn a kind of charity and a kind of tolerance, which is absolutely vital to the continuation of human life on this planet.","The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd; indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widely spread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible.","Science does not aim at establishing immutable truths and eternal dogmas; its aim is to approach the truth by successive approximations, without claiming that at any stage final and complete accuracy has been achieved.","The secret to happiness is to face the fact that the world is horrible.","We are faced with the paradoxical fact that education has become one of the chief obstacles to intelligence and freedom of thought.","When you want to teach children to think, you begin by treating them seriously when they are little, giving them responsibilities, talking to them candidly, providing privacy and solitude for them, and making them readers and thinkers of significant thoughts from the beginning. That\u2019s if you want to teach them to think.","Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves.","War doesn\'t determine who\'s right, it determines who\'s left","Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.","To understand the actual world as it is, not as we should wish it to be, is the beginning of wisdom.","We have in fact, two kinds of morality, side by side: one which we preach, but do not practice, and another which we practice, but seldom preach.","Almost all education has a political motive: it aims at strengthening some group, national or religious or even social, in the competition with other groups. It is this motive, in the main, which determines the subjects taught, the knowledge offered and the knowledge withheld, and also decides what mental habits the pupils are expected to acquire. Hardly anything is done to foster the inward growth of mind and spirit; in fact, those who have had the most education are very often atrophied in their mental and spiritual life.","I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong.","Life is just one cup of coffee after another, and don\'t look for anything else.","No great achievement is possible without persistent work.","Belief systems provide a programme which relieves the necessity of thought.","The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.","An Honest politician will not be tolerated by a democracy unless he is very stupid ... because only a very stupid man can honestly share the prejudices of more than half the nation.","Organized people are just too lazy to look for things","Life is nothing but a competition to be the criminal rather than the victim.","If an opinion contrary to your own makes you angry, that is a sign that you are subsciously aware of having no good reason for thinking as you do. [...] The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way. Persecution is used in theology, not in arithmetic, because in arithmetic there is knowledge, but in theology there is only opinion. So whenever you find yourself getting angry about a difference of opinion, be on your guard; you will probably find, on examination, that your belief is going beyond what the evidence warrants.","Few people can be happy unless they hate some other person, nation, or creed.","The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution.","If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it. If, on the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept it even on the slightest evidence. The origin of myths is explained in this way.","Democracy is the process by which people choose the man who\'ll get the blame.","God and Satan alike are essentially human figures, the one a projection of ourselves, the other of our enemies.","The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd.","If there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others, we could have a paradise in a few years.","The best life is the one in which the creative impulses play the largest part and the possessive impulses the smallest.","To realize the unimportance of time is the gate to wisdom.","Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth - more than ruin, more even than death. Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habits; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid ... Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man.","I think the subject which will be of most importance politically is Mass Psychology... Its importance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods of propaganda. Although this science will be diligently studied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class. The populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions are generated.","If you think your belief is based upon reason, you will support it by argument rather than by persecution, and will abandon it if the argument goes against you. But if your belief is based upon faith, you will realize that argument is useless, and will therefore resort to force either in the form of persecution or by stunting or distorting the minds of the young in what is called \'education.\'","Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.","The world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.","I believe four ingredients are necessary for happiness: health, warm personal relations, sufficient means to keep you from want, and successful work.","There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge.","People seem good while they are oppressed, but they only wish to become oppressors in their turn: life is nothing but a competition to be the criminal rather than the victim.","My whole religion is this: do every duty, and expect no reward for it, either here or hereafter.","Beware the man of the single book","Why is propaganda so much more successful when it stirs up hatred than when it tries to stir up friendly feeling?","You must believe that you can help bring about a better world.","It is the things for which there is no evidence that are believed with passion.","Science is what you know, philosophy is what you don\'t know.","One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one\'s work is terribly important.","I once saw a photograph of a large herd of wild elephants in Central Africa Seeing an airplane for the first time, and all in a state of wild collective terror... As, however, there were no journalists among them, the terror died down when the airplane was out of sight.","It is likely that America will be more important during the next century or two, but after that it may well be the turn of China.","To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.","I dislike Communism because it is undemocratic, and capitalism because it favors exploitation.","Next to worry probably one of the most potent causes of unhappiness is envy.","The experience of overcoming fear is extraordinarily delightful.","Patriots always talk of dying for their country and never of killing for their country.","Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.","Every great idea starts out as a blasphemy.","Most human beings, though in varying degrees, desire to control, not only their own lives but also the lives of others","Dread of disaster makes everybody act in the very way that increases the disaster.","There is something feeble and a little contemptible about a man who cannot face the perils of life without the help of comfortable myths.","More important than the curriculum is the question of the methods of teaching and the spirit in which the teaching is given","Why repeat the old errors, if there are so many new errors to commit?","I think we ought always to entertain our opinions with some measure of doubt. I shouldn\'t wish people dogmatically to believe any philosophy, not even mine.","Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.","There is darkness without and when I die there will be darkness within. There is no splendor, nor vastness anywhere; only triviality for a moment and then nothing.","Religion is something left over from the infancy of our intelligence, it will fade away as we adopt reason and science as our guidelines.","We may define \\"faith\\" as the firm belief in something for which there is no evidence.  Where there is evidence, no one speaks of \\"faith.\\"  We do not speak of faith that two and two are four or that the earth is round.  We only speak of faith when we wish to substitute emotion for evidence.  The substitution of emotion for evidence is apt to lead to strife, since different groups, substitute different emotions.","A great many worries can be diminished by realizing the unimportance of the matter which is causing anxiety.","Love should be a tree whose roots are deep in the earth, but whose branches extend into heaven.","I do not believe that science per se is an adequate source of happiness, nor do I think that my own scientific outlook has contributed very greatly to my own happiness, which I attribute to defecating twice a day with unfailing regularity.","All human activity is prompted by desire.","Grasshopper always wrong in argument with chicken.","Not to be absolutely certain is, I think, one of the essential things in rationality.","Passive acceptance of the teacher\'s wisdom is easy to most boys and girls. It involves no effort of independent thought, and seems rational because the teacher knows more than his pupils; it is moreover the way to win the favour of the teacher unless he is a very exceptional man. Yet the habit of passive acceptance is a disastrous one in later life. It causes man to seek and to accept a leader, and to accept as a leader whoever is established in that position.","The megalomaniac differs from the narcissist by the fact that he wishes to be powerful rather than charming, and seeks to be feared rather than loved. To this type belong many lunatics and most of the great men of history.","The discipline in your life should be one determined by your own desires and your own needs, not put upon you by society or authority.","Anything you\'re good at contributes to happiness.","War does not determine who is right - only who is left.","The more things a man is interested in, the more opportunities of happiness he has and the less he is at the mercy of fate, since if he loses one thing he can fall back upon another.","No man treats a motorcar as foolishly as he treats another human being. When the car will not go, he does not attribute its annoying behavior to sin; he does not say, \'You are a wicked motorcar, and I shall not give you any more petrol until you go.\' He attempts to find out what is wrong and to set it right.","Most people would sooner die than think; in fact, they do so.","Marriage is for women the commonest mode of livelihood, and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in prostitution.","Cruel men believe in a cruel god and use their belief to excuse their cruelty.  Only kindly men believe in a kindly god, and they would be kindly in any case.","Choose your parents wisely.","It is a waste of energy to be angry with a man who behaves badly, just as it is to be angry with a car that won\'t go.","The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.","Religions, which condemn the pleasures of sense, drive men to seek the pleasures of power. Throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic.","To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.","Gradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers\\nand ruled will increase until they become almost different species. A revolt\\nof the plebs would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of\\nsheep against the practice of eating mutton.","What hunger is in relation to food, zest is in relation to life.","I found one day in school a boy of medium size ill-treating a smaller boy. I expostulated, but he replied: \\"The bigs hit me, so I hit the babies; that\'s fair.\\" In these words he epitomized the history of the human race.","An educator should think of a child as a gardener thinks of a plant, as something to be made to grow by having the right soil and the right amount of water. If your roses fail to bloom, it does not occur to you to whip them, but you try to find out what has been amiss in your treatment of them. ... The important thing is what the children do, and not what they do not do. And what they do, if it is to have value, must be a spontaneous expression of their own vital energy.","No satisfaction based upon self-deception is solid, and however unpleasant the truth may be, it is better to face it once and for all, to get used to it, and to proceed to build your life in accordance with it.","If I were granted omnipotence, and millions of years to experiment in, I should not think Man much to boast of as the final result of all my efforts.","Faith: a firm belief for which there is no evidence.","That the world is in a bad shape is undeniable, but there is not the faintest reason in history to suppose that Christianity offers a way out.","In the visible world, the Milky Way is a tiny fragment; within this fragment, the solar system is an infinitesimal speck, and of this speck our planet is a microscopic dot. On this dot, tiny lumps of impure carbon and water, of complicated structure, with somewhat unusual physical and chemical properties, crawl about for a few years, until they are dissolved again into the elements of which they are compounded.","We must be skeptical even of our skepticism.","Prison is a severe and terrible punishment; but for me, thanks to Arthur Balfour, this was not so. I was much cheered on my arrival by the warder at the gate, who had to take particulars about me. He asked my religion, and I replied \'agnostic.\' He asked how to spell it, and remarked with a sigh: \'Well, there are many religions, but I suppose they all worship the same God.\' This remark kept me cheerful for about a week.","When considering marriage one should ask oneself this question; \'will I be able to talk with this person into old age?\' Everything else is transitory, the most time is spent in conversation.","We are told that Sin consists in acting contrary to God\'s commands, but we are also told that God is omnipotent. If He is, nothing contrary to His will can occur; therefore when the sinner disobeys His commands, He must have intended this to happen.","What men really want is not knowledge but certainty.","It is essential to happiness that our way of living should spring from our own deep impulses and not from the accidental tastes and desires of those who happen to be our neighbors, or even our relations.","And if there were a God, I think it very unlikely that He would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt His existence","When we look at a rock what we are seeing is not the rock, but the effect of the rock upon us.","There may be no good reasons for very many opinions that are held with passion.","Extreme hopes are born of extreme misery, and in such a world hopes could only be irrational.","The problem with the wise is they are so filled with doubts while the dull are so certain.","We all have a tendency to think that the world must conform to our prejudices. The opposite view involves some effort of thought, and most people would die sooner than think in fact they do so.","So far as I can remember, there is not one word in the Gospels in praise of intelligence.","What else is there to make life tolerable? We stand on the shore of an ocean, crying to the night and to emptiness. Sometimes a voice of one drowning, and in a moment the silence returns. The world seems to me quite dreadful, the unhappiness of many people is very great, and I often wonder how they all endure it. It is usually the central thing around which their lives are built, and I suppose if they did not live most of their lives in the things of the moment, they would not be able to go on.","If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day, there would be enough for everybody, and no unemployment \u2014 assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use so much leisure.","The really useful education is that which follows the direction of the child\'s own instinctive interests, supplying knowledge for which it is seeking, not dry, detailed information wholly out of relation to its spontaneous desires.","All forms of fear produce fatigue.","...the nonexistence of God makes more difference to some of us than to others. To me, it means that there is no absolute morality, that moralities are sets of social conventions devised by humans to satisfy their needs.","Advocates of capitalism are very apt to appeal to the sacred principles of liberty, which are embodied in one maxim: The fortunate must not be restrained in the exercise of tyranny over the unfortunate.","If the Church is not now as bad as the Soviet Government, that is due to the influence of those who attacked the Church","All religions are both harmful and untrue.","Bolshevism is to be reckoned with Mohammedanism rather than with Christianity and Buddhism. Christianity and Buddhism are primarily personal religions, with mystical doctrines and a love of contemplation. Mohammedanism and Bolshevism are practical, social, unspiritual, concerned to win the empire of the world.","Our great democracies still tend to think that a stupid man is more likely to be honest than a clever man, and our politicians take advantage of this prejudice by pretending to be even more stupid than nature has made them.","Be isolated, be ignored, be attacked, be in doubt, be frightened, but do not be silenced.","It is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age; but, if so, it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door, and this dragon is religion.","Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.","I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken.","The demand for certainty is one which is natural to man, but is nevertheless an intellectual vice.","An atheist, like a Christian, holds that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that we can know there is a God; the atheist, that we can know there is not. The Agnostic suspends judgment, saying that there are not sufficient grounds either for affirmation or for denial. At the same time, an Agnostic may hold that the existence of God, though not impossible, is very improbable; he may even hold it so improbable that it is not worth considering in practice. In that case, he is not far removed from atheism.","To be happy in this world, especially when youth is past, it is necessary to feel oneself not merely an isolated individual whose day will soon be over, but part of the stream of life flowing on from the first germ to the remote and unknown future.","Freedom of opinion can only exist when the government thinks itself secure.","When a man tells you that he knows the exact truth about anything you are safe in inferring that he is an inexact man.","Patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons.","Religion may in most of its forms be defined as the belief that the gods are on the side of the government.","While economics is about how people make choice, sociology is about how they don\'t have any choice to make.","I am sometimes shocked by the blasphemies of those who think themselves pious.","Your writing is never as good as you hoped; but never as bad as you feared.","One of the most interesting and harmful delusions to which men and nations can be subjected is that of imagining themselves special instruments of the Divine Will.","The immense majority of intellectually eminent men disbelieve in the Christian religion, but they conceal the fact in public, because they are afraid of losing their incomes.","The Christian view that all intercourse outside marriage is immoral was, as we see in the above passages from St. Paul, based upon the view that all sexual intercourse, even within marriage, is regrettable. A view of this sort, which goes against biological facts, can only be regarded by sane people as a morbid aberration. The fact that it is embedded in Christian ethics has made Christianity throughout its whole history a force tending towards mental disorders and unwholesome views of life.","The fact that a belief has a good moral effect upon a man is no evidence whatsoever in favor of its truth. I\'m not contending in a dogmatic way that there is not a God. What I\'m contending is that we don\'t know that there is. I don\'t like the word \\"absolute.\\" I don\'t think there is anything absolute whatever. The moral law, for example, is always changing. At one period in the development of the human race, almost everybody thought cannibalism was a duty.","The opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists; indeed the passion is the measure of the holders lack of rational conviction. Opinions in politics and religion are almost always held passionately.","No one gossips about other people\'s secret virtues.","Diet, injections, and injunctions will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable, and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible. Even if all are miserable, all will believe themselves happy, because the government will tell them that they are so.","Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool\'s paradise, for only a fool will think that is happiness.","What the world needs is not dogma but an attitude of scientific inquiry combined with a belief that the torture of millions is not desirable, whether inflicted by Stalin or by a Deity imagined in the likeness of the believer","Ignore fact and reason, live entirely in the world of your own fantastic and myth-producing passions; do this whole-heartedly and with conviction, and you will become one of the prophets of your age.","For love of domination we must substitute equality; for love of victory we must substitute justice; for brutality we must substitute intelligence; for competition we must substitute cooperation. We must learn to think of the human race as one family.","In democratic countries, the most important private organizations are economic. Unlike secret societies, they are able to exercise their terrorism without illegality, since they do not threaten to kill their enemies, but only to starve them.","Love, children, and work, are the great sources of fertilizing contact between the individual and the rest of the world.","What Galileo and Newton were to the seventeenth century, Darwin was to the nineteenth.","Fervent religious believers sacrifice pleasures of the body, but instead enjoy pleasures of the mind, including the joy of knowing that those men who didn\'t follow their religion would be tortured for eternity.","I\'ve made an odd discovery. Every time I talk to a savant I feel quite sure that happiness is no longer a possibility. Yet when I talk with my gardener, I\'m convinced of the opposite.","Drunkenness is temporary suicide.","Prophets, mystics, poets, scientific discoverers are men whose lives are dominated by a vision; they are essentially solitary men . . . whose thoughts and emotions are not subject to the dominion of the herd.","Most people believe in God because they have been taught from early infancy to do it, and that is the main reason. Then I think that the next most powerful reason is the wish for safety.","Much that passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of power.","One of the most powerful of all our passions is the desire to be admired and respected.","Men who allow their love of power to give them a distorted view of the world are to be found in every asylum: one man will think he is the Governor of the Bank of England, another will think he is the King, and yet another will think he is God. Highly similar delusions, if expressed by educated men in obscure language, lead to professorships of philosophy; and if expressed by emotional men in eloquent language, lead to dictatorships.","When Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning-rod, the clergy, both in England and America, with enthusiastic support of George III, condemned it as an impious attempt to defeat the will of God.","Perhaps the best hope for the future of mankind is that ways will be found of increasing the scope and intensity of sympathy.","When two men of science disagree, they do not invoke the secular arm; they wait for further evidence to decide the issue, because, as men of science, they know that neither is infallible. But when two theologians differ, since there is no criteria to which either can appeal, there is nothing for it but mutual hatred and an open or covert appeal to force.","Whenever one finds oneself inclined to bitterness, it is a sign of emotional failure.","All who are not lunatics are agreed about certain things. That it is better to be alive than dead, better to be adequately fed than starved, better to be free than a slave. Many people desire those things only for themselves and their friends; they are quite content that their enemies should suffer. These people can only be refuted by science: Humankind has become so much one family that we cannot ensure our own prosperity except by ensuring that of everyone else. If you wish to be happy yourself, you must resign yourself to seeing others also happy.","It seems to me a fundamental dishonesty, and a fundamental treachery to intellectual integrity to hold a belief because you think it\'s useful and not because you think it\'s true.","Mankind has become so much one family that we cannot insure our own prosperity except by insuring that of everyone else.","Science is at no moment quite right, but it is seldom quite wrong, and has, as a rule, a better chance of being right than the theories of the unscientific. It is, therefore, rational to accept it hypothetically.","What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the will to find out, which is the exact opposite.","Science tells us what we can know but what we can know is little and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive of many things of very great importance. Theology, on the other hand induces a dogmatic belief that we have knowledge where in fact we have ignorance and by doing so generates a kind of impertinent insolence towards the universe. Uncertainty in the presence of vivid hopes and fears is painful, but must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting fairy tales.","RELIGION: A set of beliefs held as dogmas, dominating the conduct of life, going beyond or contrary to evidence, and inculcated by methods which are emotional or authoritarian, not intellectual.","I do not pretend to be able to prove that there is no God. I equally cannot prove that Satan is a fiction. The Christian god may exist; so may the gods of Olympus, or of ancient Egypt, or of Babylon. But no one of these hypotheses is more probable than any other: they lie outside the region of even probable knowledge, and therefore there is no reason to consider any of them.","In the daily lives of most men and women, fear plays a greater part than hope: they are more filled with the thought of the possessions that others may take from them, than of the joy that they might create in their own lives and in the lives with which they come in contact. It is not so that life should be lived.","What makes a free thinker is not his beliefs, but the way in which he holds them. If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought, he finds a balance in their favor, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem.","Are you never afraid of God\'s judgement in denying him? Most certainly not. I also deny Zeus and Jupiter and Odin and Brahma, but this causes me no qualms. I observe that a very large portion of the human race does not believe in God and suffers no visible punishment in consequence. And if there were a God, I think it very unlikely that He would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt His existence.","Change is scientific; progress is ethical; change is indubitable, whereas progress is a matter of controversy.","The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.","Human nature is so constructed that it gives affection most readily to those who seem least to demand it.","Scientific societies are as yet in their infancy. It is to be expected that advances in physiology and psychology will give governments much more control over individual mentality than they now have even in totalitarian countries. Fitche laid it down that education should aim at destroying free will, so that, after pupils have left school, they shall be incapable, throughout the rest of their lives, of thinking or acting otherwise than as their schoolmasters would have wished.","I am myself a dissenter from all known religions, and I hope that every kind of religious belief will die out.","I had supposed until that time that it was quite common for parents to love their children, but the war persuaded me that it is a rare exception. I had supposed that most people liked money better than almost anything else, but I discovered that they liked destruction even better. I had supposed that intellectuals frequently loved truth, but I found here again that not ten per cent of them prefer truth to popularity.","Conventional people are roused to fury by departure from convention, largely because they regard such departure as a criticism of themselves.","Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize till you have tried to make it precise.","People will tell us that without the consolations of religion they would be intolerably unhappy. So far as this is true, it is a coward\'s argument. Nobody but a coward would consciously choose to live in a fool\'s paradise. When a man suspects his wife of infidelity, he is not thought the better of for shutting his eyes to the evidence. And I cannot see why ignoring evidence should be contemptible in one case and admirable in the other.","The widespread interest in gossip is inspired, not by a love of knowledge but by malice: no one gossips about other people\'s secret virtues, but only about their secret vices. Accordingly most gossip is untrue, but care is taken not to verify it. Our neighbour\'s sins, like the consolations of religion, are so agreeable that we do not stop to scrutinise the evidence closely.","The very best proof that something can be done is that someone has already done it.","Drunkeness is temporary suicide: the happiness that it brings is merely negative, a momentary cessation of unhappiness.","Christ said \\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\\" and when asked \\"who is thy neighbour? went on to the parable of the Good Samaritan. If you wish to understand this parable as it was understood by his hearers, you should substitute \\"Germans and Japanese\\" for Samaritan. I fear my modern day Christians would resent such a substitution, because it would compel them to realize how far they have departed from the teachings of the founder of their religion.","These illustrations suggest four general maxims[...]. The first is: remember that your motives are not always as altruistic as they seem to yourself. The second is: don\'t over-estimate your own merits. The third is: don\'t expect others to take as much interest in you as you do yourself. And the fourth is: don\'t imagine that most people give enough thought to you to have any special desire to persecute you.","If a Black Death could be spread throughout the world once in every generation survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.","In the part of this universe that we know there is great injustice, and often the good suffer, and often the wicked prosper, and one hardly knows which of those is the more annoying.","If you wish to be happy yourself, you must resign yourself to seeing others also happy.","The knowledge exists by which universal happiness can be secured; the chief obstacle to its utilization for that purpose is the teaching of religion. Religion prevents our children from having a rational education; religion prevents us from removing the fundamental causes of war; religion prevents us from teaching the ethic of scientific cooperation in place of the old fierce doctrines of sin and punishment. It is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age; but, if so, it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door, and this dragon is religion.","Who ever heard a theologian preface his creed, or a politician conclude his speech with an estimate of the probable error of his opinion?","Every advance in civilization has been denounced as unnatural while it was recent","There is a possibility in human minds of something mysterious as the night-wind, deep as the sea, calm as the stars, and strong as Death, a mystic contemplation, the \u201cintellectual love of God.\u201d Those who have known it cannot believe in wars any longer, or in any kind of hot struggle. If I could give to others what has come to me in this way, I could make them too feel the futility of fighting. But I do not know how to communicate it: when I speak, they stare, applaud, or smile, but do not understand.","One is often told that it is a very wrong thing to attack religion, because religion makes men virtuous. So I am told; I have not noticed it.","One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision.","The happiness that is genuinely satisfying is accompanied by the fullest exercise of our faculties and the fullest realization of the world in which we live.","The tragedy of the people of Palestine is that their country was \u201cgiven\u201d by a foreign power to another people for the creation of a new state. The result was that many hundreds of thousands of innocent people were made permanently homeless. With every new conflict their numbers increased. How much longer is the world willing to endure this spectacle of wanton cruelty?","If one man offers you democracy and another offers you a bag of grain, at what stage of starvation do you prefer the grain to the vote?","There is something feeble, and a little contemptible, about a man who cannot face the perils of life without the help of comfortable myths. Almost inevitably some part of him is aware that they are myths and that he believes them only because they are comforting. But he dare not face this thought, and he therefore cannot carry his own reflection to any logical conclusion.","Really high-minded people are indifferent to happiness, especially other people\'s.","The chicken noticed that the farmer came every day to feed it. It predicted that the farmer would continue to bring food every day. Inductivists think that the chicken had \\"extrapolated\\" its observations into a theory, and that each feeding time added justification to that theory. Then one day the farmer came and wrung the chicken\'s neck. This inductively justifies the conclusion that induction cannot justify any conclusion.","Men who are unhappy, like men who sleep badly, are always proud of the fact.","The man who is unhappy will, as a rule, adopt an unhappy creed, while the man who is happy will adopt a happy creed; each may attribute his happiness or unhappiness to his beliefs, while the real causation is the other way round.","To a mind of sufficient intellectual power, the whole of mathematics would appear trivial, as trivial as the statement that a four-footed animal is an animal.","Worry is a form of fear, and all forms of fear produce fatigue. A man who has learned not to feel fear will find the fatigue of daily life enormously diminished.","Science may set limits to knowledge, but should not set limits to imagination.","When you are studying any matter or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only: what are the facts, and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted by what you wish to believe, but look only and surely at what are the facts.","What we cannot think we cannot think, therefore we also cannot say what we cannot think.","It may seem to your conceited to suppose that you can do anything important toward improving the lot of mankind. But this is a fallacy. You must believe that you can help bring about a better world. A good society is produced only by good individuals, just as truly as a majority in a presidential election is produced by the votes of single electors. Everybody can do something toward creating in his own environment kindly feelings rather than anger, reasonableness rather than hysteria, happiness rather than misery.","I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its Churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.","Herd pressure is to be judged by two things: first, its intensity, and second, its direction.","I should like to believe my people\'s religion, which was just what I could wish, but alas, it is impossible. I have really no religion, for my God, being a spirit shown merely by reason to exist, his properties utterly unknown, is no help to my life. I have nor the parson\'s comfortable doctrine that every good action has its reward, and every sin is forgiven. My whole religion is this: do every duty, and expect no reward for it, either here or hereafter.","My sad conviction is that people can only agree about what they\'re not really interested in.","When a man acts in ways that annoy us we wish to think him wicked, and we refuse to face the fact that his annoying behavior is the result of antecedent causes which, if you follow them long enough, will take you beyond the moment of his birth, and therefore to events for which he cannot be held responsible by any stretch of imagination...  When a motorcar fails to start, we do not attribute its annoying behavior to sin, we do not say, you are a wicked motorcar, and you shall not have any more gasoline until you go.","Happiness is not best achieved by those who seek it directly.","No satisfaction based upon self-deception is solid.","Men have physical needs, and they have emotions. While physical needs are unsatisfied, they take first place; but when they are satisfied, emotions unconnected with them become important in deciding whether a man is to be happy or unhappy.","Dogma demands authority, rather than intelligent thought, as the source of opinion; it requires persecution of heretics and hostility to unbelievers; it asks of its disciples that they should inhibit natural kindliness in favor of systematic hatred.","All the important human advances that we know of since historical times began have been due to individuals of whom the majority faced virulent public opposition.","The social psychologist of the future will have a number of classes of school children on whom they will try different methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black. When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for more than one generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen.","I think people who are unhappy are always proud of being so, and therefore do not like to be told that there is nothing grand about their unhappiness. A man who is melancholy because lack of exercise has upset his liver always believes that it is the loss of God, or the menace of Bolshevism, or some such dignified cause that makes him sad. When you tell people that happiness is a simple matter, they get annoyed with you.","This illustrates an important truth, namely, that the worse your logic, the more interesting the consequences to which it gives rise.","And all this madness, all this rage, all this flaming death of our civilization and our hopes, has been brought about because a set of official gentlemen, living luxurious lives, mostly stupid, and all without imagination or heart, have chosen that it should occur rather than that any one of them should suffer some infinitesimal rebuff to his country`s pride.","It is preoccupation with possessions, more than anything else, that prevents us from living freely and nobly.","No people anywhere in the world would accept being expelled en masse from their own country; how can anyone require the people of Palestine to accept a punishment which nobody else would tolerate?","Man has existed for about a million years. He has possessed writing for about 6,000 years, agriculture somewhat longer, but perhaps not much longer. Science, as a dominant factor in determining the belief of educated men, has existed for about 300 years; as a source of economic technique, for about 150 years. In this brief period it has proved itself an incredibly powerful revolutionary force. When we consider how recently it has risen to power, we find ourselves forced to believe that we are at the very beginning of its work in transforming human life.","A man who has once perceived, however temporarily and however briefly, what makes greatness of soul, can no longer be happy if he allows himself to be petty, self-seeking, troubled by trivial misfortunes, dreading what fate may have in store for him. The man capable of greatness of soul will open wide the windows of his mind, letting the winds blow freely upon it from every portion of the universe.","Official morality has always been oppressive and negative: it has said \\"thou shalt not,\\" and has not troubled to investigate the effect of activities not forbidden by the code.","I feel life is so small unless it has windows into other worlds.","Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possiblities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what the may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familar things in an unfamilar aspect","The opposition of instinct and reason is mainly illusory. Instinct, intuition, or insight is what first leads to the beliefs which subsequent reason confirms or confutes; but the confirmation, where it is possible, consists, in the last analysis, of agreement with other beliefs no less instinctive. Reason is a harmonizing, controlling force rather than a creative one. Even in the most purely logical realms, it is insight that first arrives at what is new.","Many a marriage hardly differs from prostitution, except being harder to escape from.","The life of man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long.","The teacher, like the artist, the philosopher, and the man of letters, can only perform his work adequately if he feels himself to be an individual directed by an inner creative impulse, not dominated and fettered by an outside authority.","The sentiments of an adult are compounded of a kernel of instinct surrounded by a vast husk of education.","Aristotle, in spite of his reputation, is full of absurdities. He says that children should be conceived in the Winter, when the wind is in the North, and that if people marry too young the children will be female. He tells us that the blood of females is blacker than that of males; that the pig is the only animal liable to measles; that an elephant suffering from insomnia should have its shoulders rubbed with salt, olive-oil, and warm water; that women have fewer teeth than men, and so on. Nevertheless, he is considered by the great majority of philosophers a paragon of wisdom.","Man is a credulous animal, and must believe something; in the absence of good grounds for belief, he will be satisfied with bad ones.","Scientific method, although in its more refined forms it may seem complicated, is in essence remarkably simply. It consists in observing such facts as will enable the observer to discover general laws governing facts of the kind in question. The two stages, first of observation, and second of inference to a law, are both essential, and each is susceptible of almost indefinite refinement. (1931)","We know very little, and yet it is astonishing that we know so much, and still more astonishing that so little knowledge can give us so much power.","The essence of the liberal outlook lies not in what opinions are held, but in how they are held; instead of being held dogmatically, they are held tentatively, and with a consciousness that new evidence may at any moment lead to their abandonment.","Whenever you find yourself getting angry about a difference of opinion, be on your guard; you will probably find, on examination, that your belief is going beyond what the evidence warrants.","Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes the mind against speculation; but above all because, through the greatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind is also rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe which constitutes its highest good.","I feel as if one would only discover on one\'s death-bed what one ought to have lived for, and realise too late that one\'s life has been wasted. Any passionate and courageous life seems good in itself, yet one feels that some element of delusion is involved in giving so much passion to any humanly attainable object. And so irony creeps into the very springs of one\'s being.","The world in which we live can be understood as a result of muddle and accident; but if it is the outcome of deliberate purpose, the purpose must have been that of a fiend. For my part, I find accident a less painful and more plausible hypothesis.","Both in thought and in feeling, even though time be real, to realise the unimportance of time is the gate of wisdom.","There is no reason to suppose that the world had a beginning at all. The idea that things must have a beginning is really due to the poverty of our thoughts.","Most men do not feel in themselves the competence required for leading their group to victory, and therefore seek out a captain who appears to possess the courage and sagacity necessary for the achievement of supremacy. Even in religion this impulse appears. Nietzsche accused Christianity of inculcating a slave-morality, but ultimate triumph was always the goal. \\"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.","Admit at least one painful truth to yourself every day. Teach yourself to feel that life would still be worth living even if you were not immeasurably superior to all your friends. Exercises of this sort, prolonged through several years, will at last enable you to admit facts without flinching, and will, in so doing, free you from the empire of fear over a very large field.","Televison allows thousands of people to laugh at the same joke and still remain alone.","The universe may have a purpose, but nothing we know suggests that, if so, this purpose has any similarity to ours.","Philosophy, if it cannot answer so many questions as we could wish, has at least the power of asking questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.","When the state intervenes to insure the indoctrination of some doctrine, it does so because there is no conclusive evidence in favor of that doctrine.","I never held Negroes to be inherently inferior. The statement in Marriage and Morals refers to environmental conditioning. I have had it withdrawn from subsequent editions because it is clearly ambiguous.","Can a society in which thought and technique are scientific persist for a long period, as, for example, ancient Egypt persisted, or does it necessarily contain within itself forces which must bring either decay or explosion?","When there are rational grounds for an opinion, people are content to set them forth and wait for them to operate. In such cases, people do not hold their opinions with passion; they hold them calmly, and set forth their reasons quietly. The opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists; indeed the passion is the measure of the holder\'s lack of rational conviction.","More and more people are becoming unable to accept traditional [religious] beliefs. If they think that, apart from these beliefs, there is no reason for kindly behaviour, the results may be needlessly unfortunate. That is why it is important to show that no supernatural reasons are needed to make [people] kind and to prove that only through kindness can the human race achieve happiness.","Those who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the distorting medium of their own desires.","When the intensity of emotional conviction subsides, a man who is in the habit of reasoning will search for logical grounds in favour of the belief which he finds in himself.","From India to Spain, the brilliant civilization of Islam flourished. What was lost to christendom at this time was not lost to civilization, but quite the contrary.","Order, unity, and continuity are human inventions, just as truly as catalogues and encyclopedias.","You could live without the opera singer, but not without the services of the baker. On this ground you might say that the baker performs a greater service; but no lover of music would agree.","The objections to religion are of two sorts - intellectual and moral. The intellectual objection is that there is no reason to suppose any religion true; the moral objection is that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel than they are and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the moral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow.","To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead.","What has human happiness to do with morals? The object of morals is not to make people happy.","The demand for certainty is one which is natural to man, but is nevertheless an intellectual vice. So long as men are not trained to withhold judgment in the absence of evidence, they will be led astray by cocksure prophets, and it is likely that their leaders will be either ignorant fanatics or dishonest charlatans. To endure uncertainty is difficult, but so are most of the other virtues.","When I say that children should be told about sex, I do not mean that they should be told only the bare physiological facts; they should be told whatever they wish to know. There should be no attempt to represent adults as more virtuous than they are, or sex as occurring only in marriage. There is no excuse for deceiving children. And when, as must happen in conventional families, they find that their parents have lied, they lose confidence in them, and feel justified in lying to them.","Unrestricted nationalism is, in the long run, incompatible with world peace.","An extra-terrestrial philosopher, who had watched a single youth up to the age of twenty-one and had never come across any other human being, might conclude that it is the nature of human beings to grow continually taller and wiser in an indefinite progress towards perfection; and this generalization would be just as well founded as the generalization which evolutionists base upon the previous history of this planet.","To abandon the struggle for private happiness, to expel all eagerness of temporary desire, to burn with passion for eternal things-this is emancipation, and this is the free man\'s worship... United with his fellow men by the strongest of all ties, the tie of a common doom, the free man finds that a new vision is with him always, shedding over every daily task the light of love.","I think modern educational theorists are inclined to attach too much importance to the negative virtue of not interfering with children, and too little to the positive merit of enjoying their company.","Mathematics is only the art of saying the same thing in different words.","The finding of arguments for a conclusion given in advance is not philosophy, but special pleading","Those who have never known the deep intimacy and the intense companionship of happy mutual love have missed the best thing that life has to give.","Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the georgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.","The world that we must seek is a world in which the creative spirit is alive, in which life is an adventure full of joy and hope, based rather upon the impulse to construct than upon the desire to retain what we possess or to seize what is possessed by others.","A man\'s acts are partly determined by spontaneous impulse, partly by the conscious and unconscious effects of the various groups to which he belongs.","The most savage controversies are about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way.","At the age of eleven, I began Euclid, with my brother as my tutor. This was one of the great events of my life, as dazzling as first love. I had not imagined there was anything so delicious in the world. From that moment until I was thirty-eight, mathematics was my chief interest and my chief source of happiness.","A world full of happiness is not beyond human power to create; the obstacles imposed by inanimate nature are not insuperable. The real obstacles lie in the heart of man, and the cure for these is a firm hope, informed and fortified by thought.","Machines deprive us of two things which are certainly important ingredients of human happiness, namely, spontaneity and variety.","Unless you assume a God, the question of life\'s purpose is meaningless.","Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.","Clergymen almost necessarily fail in two ways as teachers of morals. They condemn acts which do no harm and they condone acts which do great harm.","For my part I distrust all generalizations about women, favorable and unfavorable, masculine and feminine, ancient and modern; all alike, I should say, result from paucity of experience.","The fact that a belief has a good moral effect upon a man is no evidence whatsoever in favor of its truth.","It is a curious and painful fact that almost all the completely futile treatments that have been believed in during the long history of medical folly have been such as caused acute suffering to the patient. When anesthetics were discovered, pious people considered them an attempt to evade the will of God. It was pointed out, however, that when God extracted Adam\'s rib He put him into a deep sleep. This proved that anesthetics are all right for men; women, however, ought to suffer, because of the curse of Eve.","Affection cannot be created; it can only be liberated.","Even if the open windows of science at first make us shiver after the cozy indoor warmth of traditional humanizing myths, in the end the fresh air brings vigor, and the great spaces have a splendor of their own.","If I were a medical man, I should prescribe a holiday to any patient who considered his work important.","All\'s well that ends well; which is the epitaph I should put on my tombstone if I were the last man left alive.","Folly is perennial and yet the human race has survived.","The human race may well become extinct before the end of the century. Speaking as a mathematician, I should say the odds are about three to one against survival.","I believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive.  I am not young, and I love life.  But I should scorn to shiver with terror at the thought of annihilation.  Happiness is nonetheless true happiness because it must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value because they are not everlasting.","I am firm; YOU are obstinate; HE is a pig-headed fool.","Science seems to be at war with itself.... Naive realism leads to physics, and physics, if true, shows naive realism to be false. Therefore naive realism, if true, is false; therefore it is false.","I FIND IT SO DIFFICULT NOT TO HATE, WHEN I DO NOT HATE I FEEL WE FEW ARE SO LONELY IN THE WORLD","I know a parson who frightened his congregation terribly by telling them the second coming was very imminent indeed, but they were much consoled when they found he was planting trees in his garden.","People are zealous for a cause when they are not quite positive that it is true.","It can be shown that a mathematical web of some kind can be woven about any universe containing several objects. The fact that our universe lends itself to mathematical treatment is not a fact of any great philosophical significance.","If two hitherto rival football teams, under the influence of brotherly love, decided to co-operate in placing the football first beyond one goal and then beyond the other, no one\'s happiness would be increased","Americans and Englishmen, when they become acquainted with the Balkans, feel an astonished contempt when they study the mutual enmities of Bulgarians and Serbs, of Hungarians and Rumanians. It is evident to them that these enmities are absurd and that the belief of each little nation in its own superiority has no objective basis. But most of them are quite unable to see that the national pride of a Great Power is essentially as unjustifiable as that of a little Balkan country.","William James used to preach the \\"will-to-believe.\\" For my part, I should wish to preach the \\"will-to-doubt.\\" None of our beliefs are quite true; all at least have a penumbra of vagueness and error. What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the will to find out, which is the exact opposite.","How much good it would do if one could exterminate the human race.","I often long to . . . give up my life to love of my neighbour. This is really a temptation.","I do not believe that I am now dreaming, but I cannot prove that I am not.","Philosophy, from the earliest times, has made greater claims, and achieved fewer results, than any other branch of learning.","Moral indignation is one of the most harmful forces in the modern world, the more so as it can always be diverted to sinister uses by those who control propaganda.","You may reasonably expect a man to walk a tightrope safely for ten minutes; it would be unreasonable to do so without accident for two hundred years.","Truth is a shining goddess, always veiled, always distant, never wholly approachable, but worthy of all the devotion of which the human spirit is capable.","The whole conception of a God is a conception derived from the ancient oriental despotisms. It is a conception quite unworthy of free men. We ought to stand up and look the world frankly in the face. We ought to make the best we can of the world, and if it is not so good as we wish, after all it will still be better than what these others have made of it in all these ages.","Mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.","One of the main causes of trouble in the world is dogmatic and fanatical belief in some doctrine for which there is no adequate evidence","In attempting to understand the elements out of which mental phenomena are compounded, it is of the greatest importance to remember that from the protozoa to man there is nowhere a very wide gap either in structure or in behaviour. From this fact it is a highly probable inference that there is also nowhere a very wide mental gap.","A democrat need not believe that the majority will always reach a wise decision. He should however believe in the necessity of accepting the decision of the majority, be it wise or unwise, until such a time that the majority reaches another decision.","I do not think that the real reason why people accept religion has anything to do with argumentation. They accept religion on emotional grounds.","Patience and boredom are closely related. Boredom, a certain kind of boredom, is really impatience. You don\'t like the way things are, they aren\'t interesting enough for you, so you deccide- and boredom is a decision-that you are bored.","Christ . . . said that a man who had looked after a woman lustfully had sinned as much as the man who had seduced her. How absurd!","What was exciting in the Victorian Age, would leave a man of franker epoch quite unmoved. The more prudes restrict the permissible degree of sexual appeal, the less is required to make such an appeal effective.","Righteousness cannot be born until self-righteousness is dead.","All exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation.","Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake.","Some people would rather die than think.","Descartes, the father of modern philosophy ... would never-so he assures us-have been led to construct his philosophy if he had had only one teacher, for then he would have believed what he had been told; but, finding that his professors disagreed with each other, he was forced to conclude that no existing doctrine was certain.","I do not myself feel that any person who is really profoundly humane can believe in everlasting punishment.","If we spent half an hour every day in silent immobility, I am convinced that we should conduct all our affairs, personal, national, and international, far more sanely than we do at present.","The scientific attitude of mind involves a sweeping away of all other desires in the interests of the desire to know-it involves suppression of hopes and fears, loves and hates, and the whole subjective emotional life, until we become subdued to the material, able to see it frankly, without preconceptions, without bias, without any wish except to see it as it is, and without any belief that what it is must be determined by some relation, positive or negative, to what we should like it to be, or to what we can easily imagine it to be.","There is exactly the same degree of possibility and likelihood of the existence of the Christian God as there is of the existence of the Homeric god. I cannot prove that either the Christian god or the Homeric gods do not exist, but I do not think that their existence is an alternative that is sufficiently probable to be worth serious consideration.","I used often to go to America during Prohibition, and there was far more drunkenness there then than before; the prohibition of pornography has much the same effect.","Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions, which move with him like flies on a summer day.","The whole of theology, in regard to hell no less than to heaven, takes it for granted that Man is what is of most importance in the Universe of created beings. Since all theologians are men, this postulate has met with little opposition.","A religious creed differs from a scientific theory in claiming to embody eternal and absolutely certain truth, whereas science is always tentative, expecting that modification in its present theories will sooner or later be found necessary, and aware that its method is one which is logically incapable of arriving at a complete and final demonstration.","Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, Thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit. Thought is great and swift and free.","To the primitive mind, everything is either friendly or hostile; but experience has shown that friendliness and hostility are not the conceptions by which the world is to be understood.","Orthodoxy is the grave of intelligence, no matter what orthodoxy it may be.","In former days, men sold themselves to the Devil to acquire magical powers. Nowadays they acquire those powers from science, and find themselves compelled to become devils. There is no hope for the world unless power can be tamed, and brought into the service, not of this or that group of fanatical tyrants, but of the whole human race, white and yellow and black, fascist and communist and democrat; for science has made it inevitable that all must live or all must die.","What will be the good of the conquest of leisure and health, if no one remembers how to use them?","I conclude that, while it is true that science cannot decide questions of value, that is because they cannot be intellectually decided at all, and lie outside the realm of truth and falsehood. Whatever knowledge is attainable, must be attained by scientific methods; and what science cannot discover, mankind cannot know.","A happy life must be to a great extent a quiet life, for it is only in an atmosphere of quiet that true joy dare live.","Even if we could be certain that one of the world\'s religions were perfectly true, given the sheer number of conflicting faiths on offer, every believer should expect damnation purely as a matter of probability.","The harm that theology has done is not to create cruel impulses, but to give them the sanction of what professes to be lofty ethic, and to confer an apparently sacred character upon practices which have come down from more ignorant and barbarous times.","A man without a bias cannot write interesting history - if indeed such a man exists.","Thinking you know when in fact you don\'t is a fatal mistake, to which we are all prone","All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction. So now, my friends, if that is true, and it is true, what is the point?","The root of the matter is a very simple and old fashioned thing... love or compassion. If you feel this, you have a motive for existence, a guide for action, a reason for courage, an imperative necessity for intellectual honesty.","Although this may seem a paradox, all exact science is based on the idea of approximation. If a man tells you he knows a thing exactly, then you can be safe in inferring that you are speaking to an inexact man.","A habit of finding pleasure in thought rather than action is a safeguard against unwisdom and excessive love of power, a means of preserving serenity in misfortune and peace of mind among worries. A life confined to what is personal is likely, sooner or later, to become unbearably painful; it is only by windows into a larger and less fretful cosmos that the more tragic parts of life become endurable.","In all affairs it\'s a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted.","I don\'t care for the applause one gets by saying what others are thinking; I want actually to change people\'s thoughts. Power over people\'s minds is the main personal desire of my life; and this sort of power is not acquired by saying popular things.","The average man\'s opinions are much less foolish than they would be if he thought for himself.","The habit of looking to the future and thinking that the whole meaning of the present lies in what it will bring forth is a pernicious one. There can be no value in the whole unless there is value in the parts.","My own view on religion is that of Lucretius. I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race. I cannot, however, deny that it has made some contributions to civilisation. It helped in early days to fix the calendar, and it caused Egyptian priests to chronicle eclipses with such care that in time they became able to predict them. These two services I am prepared to acknowledge, but I do not know of any others.","The man who suffers from a sense of sin is suffering from a particular kind of self-love. In all this vast universe the thing that appears to him of most importance is that he himself should be virtuous. It is a grave defect in certain forms of traditional religion that they have encouraged this particular kind of self-absorption.","Religion is based, I think, primarily and mainly upon fear.","The more we realize our minuteness and our impotence in the face of cosmic forces, the more amazing becomes what human beings have achieved.","Religions that teach brotherly love have been used as an excuse for persecution, and our profoundest scientific insight is made into a means of mass destruction.","All definite knowledge - so I should contend - belongs to science; all dogma as to what surpasses definite knowledge belongs to theology. But between theology and science there is a No Man\'s Land, exposed to attack by both sides; this No Man\'s Land is philosophy.","Stupidity and unconscious bias often work more damage than venality.","Unhappy business men, I am convinced, would increase their happiness more by walking six miles every day than by any conceivable change of philosophy.","Fundamental happiness depends more than anything else upon what may be called a friendly interest in persons and things.","Most political leaders acquire their position by causing large numbers of people to believe that these leaders are actuated by altruistic desires","Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world needs most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life of arduous struggle. Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen, instead, to have overwork for some and starvation for the others. Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines; in this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish for ever.","After ages during which the earth produced harmless trilobites and butterflies, evolution progressed to the point at which it generated Neros, Genghis Khans, and Hitlers. This, however, is a passing nightmare; in time the earth will become again incapable of supporting life, and peace will return.","I was told that The Chinese said they would bury me by the Western Lake and build a shrine to my memory. I have some slight regret that this did not happen, as I might have become a god, which would have been very chic for an atheist.","If we were all given by magic the power to read each other\'s thoughts, I suppose the first effect would be to dissolve all friendships.","Belief in a Divine mission is one of the many forms of certainty that have afflicted the human race.","To understand a name you must be acquainted with the particular of which it is a name.","The commonest objection to birth control is that it is against nature.","If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument... The idea that things must have a beginning is really due to the poverty of our imagination.","At the age of eleven, I began Euclid, with my brother as my tutor. ... I had not imagined that there was anything so delicious in the world. After I had learned the fifth proposition, my brother told me that it was generally considered difficult, but I had found no difficulty whatsoever. This was the first time it had dawned on me that I might have some intelligence.","Hegel\'s philosophy is so odd that one would not have expected him to be able to get sane men to accept it, but he did. He set it out with so much obscurity that people thought it must be profound. It can quite easily be expounded lucidly in words of one syllable, but then its absurdity becomes obvious.","War can only be abolished by the establishment of a world government.","The skill of the politician consists in guessing what people can be brought to think advantageous to themselves; the skill of the expert consists in calculating what really is advantageous, provided people can be brought to think so.","Historically, it is quite doubtful whether Christ ever existed at all, and if He did we do not know anything about Him.","I mean by intellectual integrity the habit of deciding vexed questions in accordance with the evidence, or of leaving them undecided where the evidence is inconclusive. This virtue, though it is underestimated by almost all adherents of any system of dogma, is to my mind of the very greatest social importance and far more likely to benefit the world than Christianity or any other system of organized beliefs.","It is not what the man of science believes that distinguishes him, but how and why he believes it. His beliefs are tentative, not dogmatic; they are based on evidence, not on authority or intuition.","Broadly speaking, we are in the middle of a race between human skill as a means and human folly as an end.","In action, in desire, we must submit perpetually to the tyranny of outside forces; but in thought, in aspiration, we are free, free from our fellowmen, free from the petty planet on which our bodies impotently crawl, free even, while we live, from the tyranny of death.","Everybody can do something toward creating in his own environment kindly feelings rather than anger, reasonableness rather than hysteria, happiness rather than misery.","Politics is concerned with herds rather than with individuals, and the passions which are important in politics are, therefore, those in which the various members of a given herd can feel alike.","It has been said that man is a rational animal. All my life I have been searching for evidence which could support this.","Gradually, ... the aspect of science as knowledge is being thrust into the background by the aspect of science as the power of manipulating nature. It is because science gives us the power of manipulating nature that it has more social importance than art. Science as the pursuit of truth is the equal, but not the superior, of art. Science as a technique, though it may have little intrinsic value, has a practical importance to which art cannot aspire.","Man needs, for his happiness, not only the enjoyment of this or that, but hope and enterprise and change.","But courage in fighting is by no means the only form, nor perhaps even the most important. There is courage in facing poverty, courage in facing derision, courage in facing the hostility of one\'s own herd. In these, the bravest soldiers are often lamentably deficient. And above all there is the courage to think calmly and rationally in the face of danger, and to control the impulse of panic fear or panic rage.","The criminal law has, from the point of view of thwarted virtue, the merit of allowing an outlet for those impulses of aggression which cowardice, disguised as morality, restrains in their more spontaneous forms. War has the same merit. You must not kill you neighbor, whom perhaps you genuinely hate, but by a little propaganda this hate can be transferred to some foreign nation, against whom all your murderous impulses become patriotic heroism.","It seems to me now that mathematics is capable of an artistic excellence as great as that of any music, perhaps greater; not because the pleasure it gives (although very pure) is comparable, either in intensity or in the number of people who feel it, to that of music, but because it gives in absolute perfection that combination, characteristic of great art, of godlike freedom, with the sense of inevitable destiny; because, in fact, it constructs an ideal world where everything is perfect and yet true.","Man is a rational animal \u2013 so at least I have been told. Throughout a long life, I have looked diligently for evidence in favour of this statement, but so far I have not had the good fortune to come across it, though I have searched in many countries spread over three continents.","Belief in God and a future life makes it possible to go through life with less of stoic courage than is needed by skeptics.","Of all evils of war the greatest is the purely spiritual evil: the hatred, the injustice, the repudiation of truth, the artificial conflict.","But if thought is to become the possession of many, not the privilege of the few, we must have done with fear. It is fear that holds men back - fear lest their cherished beliefs should prove delusions, fear lest the institutions by which they live should prove harmful, fear lest they themselves should prove less worthy of respect than they have supposed themselves to be.","My conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and, further, that there is no reason to wish that they were true.  Man, in so far as he is not subject to natural forces, is free to work out his own destiny.  The responsibility is his, and so is the opportunity.","The puritanism of Christianity has played havoc with the moderation that an enlightened and tolerant critical spirit would have produced. I\'ve noticed that in whatever country, county, town, or other region there is a regulation enjoining temperance, the population seems to be entirely composed of teetotallers and drunkards. There\'s a Bible on that shelf there. But I keep it next to Voltaire - poison and antidote.","Intelligence, it might be said, has caused our troubles; but it is not unintelligence that will cure them. Only more and wiser intelligence can make a happier world","Many a man will have the courage to die gallantly, but will not have the courage to say, or even to think, that the cause for which he is asked to die is an unworthy one.","HELL: A place where the police are German, the motorists French and the cooks English.","It is no credit to the orthodox that they do not now believe all the absurdities that were believed 150 years ago. The gradual emasculation of the Christian doctrine has been effected in spite of the most vigorous resistance, and solely as the result of the onslaughts of freethinkers.","Many people when they fall in love look for a little haven of refuge from the world, where they can be sure of being admired when they are not admirable, and praised when they are not praiseworthy.","Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; no fire, no heroism, no intensity of though and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave.","No man can be a good teacher unless he has feelings of warm affection toward his pupils and a genuine desire to impart to them what he believes to be of value.","Speaking psycho-analytically, it may be laid down that any \\"great ideal\\" which people mention with awe is really an excuse for inflicting pain on their enemies. Good wine needs no bush, and good morals need no bated breath.","I don\'t like the spirit of socialism - I think freedom is the basis of everything.","Love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse; it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives.","[Man] ... his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labour of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man\'s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins.","When people begin to philosophize they seem to think it necessary to make themselves artificially stupid.","Liberty is the right to do what I like; licence, the right to do what you like.","All movements go too far.","The fundamental defect of fathers, in our competitive society, is that they want their children to be a credit to them. We all feel instinctively, that our children\'s success reflect glory upon ourselves, while their failures make us feel shame. Unfortunately, the successes which cause us to swell with pride are often of an undesirable kind.... Neither happiness nor virtue, but worldly success, is what the average father desires for his children.","Organic life, we are told, has developed gradually from the protozoon to the philosopher, and this development, we are assured, is indubitably an advance. Unfortunately it is the philosopher, not the protozoon, who gives us this assurance.","There is no greater reason for children to honour parents than for parents to honour children except, that while the children are young, the parents are stronger than children.","A hallucination is a fact, not an error; what is erroneous is a judgment based upon it.","As soon as it is held that any belief, no matter what, is important for some other reason than that it is true, a whole host of evils is ready to spring up.","a generation that cannot endure boredom will be a generation of little men, of men unduly divorced from the slow process of nature, of men in whom every vital impulse slowly withers as though they were cut flowers in a vase.","We are condemned to kill time, thus we die bit by bit. - Octavio Paz The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.","It is, of course, clear that a country with a large foreign population must endeavour, through its schools, to assimilate the children of immigrants. It is, however, unfortunate that a large part of this process should be effected by means of a somewhat blatant nationalism.","You could take up the line that some of the gnostics took up - a line which I often thought was a very plausible one - that as a matter of fact this world that we know was made by the devil at a moment when God was not looking. There is a good deal to be said for that, and I am not concerned to refute it.","The fundamental defect of fathers, in our competitive society, is that they want their children to be a credit to them.","The satisfaction to be derived from success in a great constructive enterprise is one of the most massive that life has to offer.","...I am afraid that education is conceived more in terms of indoctrination by most school officials than in terms of enlightenment. My own belief is that education must be subversive if it is to be meaningful. By this I mean that it must challenge all the things we take for granted, examine all accepted assumptions, tamper with every sacred cow, and instill a desire to question and doubt. Without this the mere instruction to memorise data is empty. The attempt to enforce conventional mediocrity on the young is criminal.","The search for something permanent is one of the deepest of the instincts leading men to philosophy.","To avoid the various foolish opinions to which mankind are prone, no superhuman genius is required. A few simple rules will keep you, not from all error, but from silly error.","Science, by itself cannot, supply us with an ethic.","The governors of the world believe, and have always believed, that virtue can only be taught by teaching falsehood, and that any man who knew the truth would be wicked. I disbelieve this, absolutely and entirely. I believe that love of truth is the basis of all real virtue, and that virtues based upon lies can only do harm.","(on A History of Western Philosophy) I was sometimes accused by reviewers of writing not a true history but a biased account of the events that I arbitrarily chose to write of. But to my mind, a man without a bias cannot write interesting history - if, indeed, such man exists.","I must, before I die, find some way to say the essential thing that is in me, that I have never said yet -- a thing that is not love or hate or pity or scorn, but the very breath of life, fierce and coming from far away, bringing into human life the vastness and the fearful passionless force of non-human things.","Love cannot exists as a duty; to tell a child that it ought to love its parents and its brother and sisters is utterly useless, if not worse.","A good man will never suspect his friends of shady actions: this is part of his goodness. A good man will never be suspected by the public of using his goodness to screen villains: this is part of his utility","The human heart as modern civilization has made it is more prone to hatred than to friendship. And it is prone to hatred because it is dissatisfied.","Aristotle maintained that women have fewer teeth than men; although he was twice married, it never occurred to him to verify this statement by examining his wives\' mouths.","The resistance to a new idea increases by the square of its importance.","The painter has to unlearn the habit of thinking that things seem to have the color which common sense says they \'really\' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they appear.","Physics is mathematical not because we know so much about the physical world, but because we know so little; it is only its mathematical properties that we can discover.","This, however, is a passing nightmare; in time the earth will become again incapable of supporting life, and peace will return.","Writing can be either readable or precise, but not at the same time.","Mathematics rightly viewed possesses not only truth but supreme beauty.","Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand-in-hand. It is because fear is at the basis of those two things. In this world we can now begin a little to understand things, and a little to master them by the help of science, which has forced its way step by step against the Christian religion, against the churches, and against the opposition of all the old precepts.","It\'s coexistence or no existence.","You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in humane feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races, or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the world. I say quite deliberately that the christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is the principle enemy of moral progress in the world.","Education, which was at first made universal in order that all might be able to read and write, has been found capable of serving quite other purposes. By instilling nonsense it unifies populations and generates collective enthusiasm.","I hold all knowledge that is concerned with things that actually exist - all that is commonly called Science - to be of very slight value compared to the knowledge which, like philosophy and mathematics, is concerned with ideal and eternal objects, and is freed from this miserable world which God has made.","Freedom in education has many aspects. There is first of all freedom to learn or not to learn. Then there is freedom as to what to learn. And in later education there is freedom of opinion.","The secrets to happiness include enterprise, exploration of one\'s interests and the overcoming of obstacles.","I hate the world and almost all the people in it. I hate the Labour Congress and the journalists who send men to be slaughtered, and the fathers who feel a smug pride when their sons are killed, and even the pacifists who keep saying human nature is essentially good, in spite of all the daily proofs to the contrary. I hate the planet and the human race\u2014I am ashamed to belong to such a species.","I did not know I loved you until I heard myself telling so, for one instance I thought, \\"Good God, what have I said?\\" and then I knew it was true.","Into every tidy scheme for arranging the pattern of human life, it is necessary to inject a certain dose of anarchism.","You find this curious fact, that the more intense has been the religion of any period and more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs. In the so called age of faith, when men really did believe the Christian religion in all its completeness, there was the Inquisition, with its tortures; there were millions of unfortunate women burnt as witches; and there was every kind of cruelty practised upon all sorts of people in the name of religion.","The moral thing I should wish to say to them is very simple; I should say: \\"Love is wise - Hatred is foolish.\\" In this world, which is getting more and more closely interconnected, we have to learn to tolerate each other.","To teach how to live without certainty and yet without being paralysed by hesitation is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can do for those who study it.","In science the successors stand upon the shoulders of their predecessors; where one man of supreme genius has invented a method, a thousand lesser men can apply it. ... In art nothing worth doing can be done without genius; in science even a very moderate capacity can contribute to a supreme achievement.","If one lived for ever the joys of life would inevitably in the end lose their savour. As it is, they remain perennially fresh.","Owing to the identification of religion with virtue, together with the fact that the most religious men are not the most intelligent, a religious education gives courage to the stupid to resist the authority of educated men, as has happened, for example, where the teaching of evolution has been made illegal. So far as I can remember, there is not one word in the Gospels in praise of intelligence; and in this respect ministers of religion follow gospel authority more closely than in some others.","Although it is a gloomy view to suppose that life will die out, sometimes when I contemplate the things that people do with their lives I think it is almost a consolation","The difficulty is old, but none the less real. An omnipotent being who created a world containing evil not due to sin must Himself be at least partially evil.","Power is sweet; it is a drug, the desire for which increases with a habit.","One of the chief obstacles to intelligence is credulity, and credulity could be enormously diminished by instructions as to the prevalent forms of mendacity. Credulity is a greater evil in the present day than it ever was before, because, owing to the growth of education, it is much easier than it used to be to spread misinformation, and, owing to democracy, the spread of misinformation is more important than in former times to the holders of power.","What\'s the difference between a bright, inquisitive five-year-old, and a dull, stupid nineteen-year-old? Fourteen years of the British educational system.","I think it would be just to say the most essential characteristic of mind is memory, using this word in its broadest sense to include every influence of past experience on present reactions.","Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say.","Insight, untested and unsupported, is an uncertain guarantee of the truth.","It is entirely clear that there is only one way in which great wars can be permanently prevented, and that is the establishment of an international government with a monopoly of serious armed force.","My own belief is that in most ages and in most places obscure psychological forces led men to adopt systems involving quite unnecessary cruelty, and that this is still the case among the most civilized races at the present day.","Language serves not only to express thought but to make possible thoughts which could not exist without it.","Among human beings, the subjection of women is much more complete at a certain level of civilization than it is among savages. And the subjection is always reinforced by morality.","A process which led from the amoeba to man appeared to the philosophers to be obviously a progress though whether the amoeba would agree with this opinion is not known.","To like many people spontaneously and without effort is perhaps the greatest of all sources of personal happiness.","It will be said that the joy of mental adventure must be rare, that there are few who can appreciate it, and that ordinary education can take no account of so aristocratic a good. I do not believe this. The joy of mental adventure is far commoner in the young than in grown men and women. ...It is rare in later life because everything is done to kill it during education.","If any philosopher had been asked for a definition of infinity, he might have produced some unintelligible rigmarole, but he would certainly not have been able to give a definition that had any meaning at all.","There are two motives for reading a book; one, that you enjoy it; the other, that you can boast about it.","No nation was ever so virtuous as each believes itself, and none was ever so wicked as each believes the other.","Some care is needed in using Descartes\' argument. \\"I think, therefore I am\\" says rather more than is strictly certain. It might seem as though we are quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were yesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. But the real Self is as hard to arrive at as the real table, and does not seem to have that absolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences.","It is for this reason that rationality is of supreme importance to the well-being of the human species...even more, in those less fortunate times in which it is despised and rejected as the vain dream of men who lack the virility to kill where they cannot agree.","How much longer is the world willing to endure this spectacle of wanton cruelty?","It is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it true","The happy life is to an extraordinary extent the same as the good life.","Mysticism is, in essence, little more than a certain intensity and depth of feeling in regard to what is believed about the universe.","The \\"social contract,\\" in the only sense in which it is not completely mythical, is a contract among conquerors, which loses its raison d\'\xeatre if they are deprived of the benefits of conquest.","A good world needs knowledge, kindliness, and courage; it does not need a regretful hankering after the past or a fettering of the free intelligence by the words uttered long ago by ignorant men.","Brief and powerless is man\'s life; on him and all his race the slow, sure doom falls pitiless and dark.","Any pleasure that does no harm to other people is to be valued.","Italy, and the spring and first love all together should suffice to make the gloomiest person happy.","I remain convinced that obstinate addiction to ordinary language in our private thoughts is one of the main obstacles to progress in philosophy.","Freedom in general may be defined as the absence of obstacles to the realization of desires.","To acquire immunity to eloquence is of the utmost importance to the citizens of a democracy.","Science is what we know, and philosophy is what we don\'t know.","If you had the power to destroy the world, would you do so?","Civilized people cannot fully satisfy their sexual instinct without love.","With the introduction of agriculture mankind entered upon a long period of meanness, misery, and madness, from which they are only now being freed by the beneficent operation of the machine.","The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt. Even those of the intelligent who believe that they have a nostrum are too individualistic to combine with other intelligent men from whom they differ on minor points.","I read Zuleika Dobson with pleasure. It represents the Oxford that the two World Wars have destroyed with a charm that is not likely to be reproduced anywhere in the world for the next thousand years.","Dread of disaster makes everybody act in the very way that increases the disaster. Psychologically the situation is analogous to that of people trampled to death when there is a panic in a theatre caused by a cry of `Fire!\'.","One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one\'s work is terribly important, and that to take a holiday would bring all kinds of disaster.  If I were a medical man, I should prescribe a holiday to any patient who considered his or her work important.","Obviousness is always the enemy of correctness.","There are some simple maxims which I think might be commended to writers of expository prose. First: never use a long word if a short word will do. So, if you want to make a statement with a great many qualifications, put some of the qualifications in separate sentences. Third: do not let the beginning of your sentence lead the reader to an expectation which is contradicted by the end.","A sense of duty is useful in work but offensive in personal relations. People wish to be liked, not to be endured with patient resignation.","The question of \\"unreality\\"is a very important one. Misled by grammar, the great majority of those logicians who have dealt with this question have dealt with it on mistaken lines. They have regarded grammatical form as a surer guide in analysis than, in fact, it is. And they have not known what differences in grammatical form are important.","I believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive.","The world that I should wish to see would be one freed from the virulence of group hostilities and capable of realizing that happiness for all is to be derived rather from co-operation than from strife. I should wish to see a world in which education aimed at mental freedom rather than imprisoning the minds of the young in rigid armor of dogma calculated to protect them through life against the shafts of impartial evidence.","None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error.","When you come to look into this argument from design, it is a most astonishing thing that people can believe that this world, with all the things that are in it, with all its defects, should be the best that omnipotence and omniscience has been able to produce in millions of years.","Life and hope for the world are to be found only in the deeds of love.","There are certain things that our age needs. It needs, above all, courageous hope and the impulse to creativeness.","No Carthaginian denied Moloch, because to do so would have required more courage that was required to face death in battle.","The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.","America... where law and custom alike are based upon the dreams of spinsters...","It seems to us unwise to have insisted on teaching geometry to the younger Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, in order to make him a good king, but from Plato\'s point of view it was essential. He was sufficiently Pythagorean to think that without mathematics no true wisdom is possible.","The . . . increase in the power of officials is a constant source of irritation to everybody else.","[There are m]oral precepts that we consider really important, such as \'don\'t pick your nose\' or \'don\'t eat peas with a knife\'. There may, for ought I know, be admirable reasons for eating peas with a knife, but . . . early persuasion has made me completely incapable of appreciating them.","There have been poverty, pestilence, and famine, which were due to man\'s inadequate mastery of nature. There have been wars, oppressions and tortures which have been due to men\'s hostility to their fellow men.","There is in Aristotle an almost complete absence of what may be called benevolence or philanthropy. The sufferings of mankind . . . there is no evidence that they cause him unhappiness except when the sufferers happen to be his friends.","There was a law in Connecticut - I believe it is still formally unrepealed - making it illegal for a man to kiss his wife on Sunday.","I suppose the advocates of unreason think that there is a better chance of profitably deceiving the populace if they keep it in a state of effervescence.","If throughout your life you abstain from murder, theft, fornication, perjury, blasphemy, and disrespect toward your parents, church, and your king, you are conventionally held to deserve moral admiration even if you have never done a single kind, generous or useful action. This very inadequate notion of virtue is an outcome of taboo morality, and has done untold harm.","The main things which seem to me important on their own account, and not merely as means to other things, are knowledge, art, instinctive happiness, and relations of friendship or affection.","There is no nonsense so errant that it cannot be made the creed of the vast majority by adequate governmental action.","I consider the official Catholic attitude on divorce, birth control, and censorship exceedingly dangerous to mankind.","Morality in sexual relations, when it is free from superstition, consists essentially in respect for the other person, and unwillingness to use that person solely as a means of personal gratification, without regard to his or her desires.","My first advice (on how not to grow old) would be to choose you ancestors carefully.","No man is liberated from fear who dare not see his place in the world as it is; no man can achieve the greatness of which he is capable until he has allowed himself to see his own littleness.","Protestants, from the first, have been distinguished from their opponents by what they do not believe; to throw over one more dogma is, therefore, merely to carry the movement one stage further. Moral fervor is the essence of the matter.","Citizens as conceived by governments are persons who admire the status quo and are prepared to exert themselves for its preservation. Oddly enough, while all governments aim at producing men of this type to the exclusion of all other types, their heroes in the past are of exactly the sort that they aim at preventing in the present. Americans admire George Washington and Jefferson, but imprison those who share their political opinions.","That which exists through itself is called The Eternal. The Eternal has neither name nor shape. It is the one essence, the one primal spirit. Essence and life cannot be seen. They are contained in the light of heaven. The light of heaven cannot be seen. It is contained in the two eyes.","I\'ve always thought respectable people scoundrels, and I look anxiously at my face every morning for signs of my becoming a scoundrel.","The first man who said \\"fire burns\\" was employing scientific method, at any rate if he had allowed himself to be burnt several times. This man had already passed through the two stages of observation and generalization. He had not, however, what scientific technique demands - a careful choice of significant facts on the one hand, and, on the other hand, various means of arriving at laws otherwise than my mere generalization.","Upon hearing via Littlewood an exposition on the theory of relativity: To think I have spent my life on absolute muck.","Formality Thus the absence of all mention of particular things or properties in logic or pure mathematics is a necessary result of the fact that this study is, as we say, \\"purely formal\\".","Answering questions is a major part of sex education. Two rules cover the ground. First, always give a truthful answer to a question; secondly, regard sex knowledge as exactly like any other knowledge.","Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth\'s surface relative to other matter; second, telling other people to do so.","A man is rational in proportion as his intelligence informs and controls his desires.","Our use of the phrase \'The Dark Ages\' to cover the period from 600 to 1000 marks our undue concentration on Western Europe. [...] From India to Spain, the brilliant civilisation of Islam flourished. What was lost to Christendom at this time was not lost to civilisation, but quite the contrary. [...] To us it seems that West-European civilisation is civilisation, but this is a narrow view.","There can\'t be a practical reason for believing something that is not true.","It is amusing to hear the modern Christian telling you how mild and rationalistic Christianity really is and ignoring the fact that all its mildness and rationalism is due to the teaching of men who in their own day were persecuted by all orthodox Christians.","Protagoras did not know if the gods exist, but he held in any case they ought to be worshiped. Philosophy, according to him, had nothing edifying to teach, and for the survival of morals we must rely upon the thoughtlessness of the majority and their willingness to believe what they had been taught.","Politics is largely governed by sententious platitudes which are devoid of truth","To think I have spent my life on absolute muck.","From the height of their disillusionment they look down upon those whom they despise as simple souls. For my part I have no sympathy with this outlook. All disenchantment is to me a malady, which, it is true, certain circumstances may render inevitable, but which none the less, when it occurs, is to be cured as soon as possible, not to be regarded as a higher form of wisdom.","Reason may be a small force, but it is constant, and works always in one direction, while the forces of unreason destroy one another in futile strife.","It appeared to me that the dignity of which human existence is capable is not attainable by devotion to the mechanism of life , and that unless contemplation of eternal things is preserved, mankind will become no better than well-fed pigs.","I have been merely oppressed by the weariness and tedium and vanity of things lately: nothing stirs me, nothing seems worth doing or worth having done: the only thing that I strongly feel worth while would be to murder as many people as possible so as to diminish the amount of consciousness in the world. These times have to be lived through: there is nothing to be done with them.","In obedience to the feeling of reality, we shall insist that, in the analysis of propositions, nothing \\"unreal\\" is to be admitted. But, after all, if there is nothing unreal, how, it may be asked, could we admit anything unreal? The reply is that, in dealing with propositions, we are dealing in the first instance with symbols, and if we attribute significance to groups of symbols which have no significance, we shall fall into the error of admitting unrealities, in the only sense in which this is possible, namely, as objects described.","The axiomatic method has many advantages over honest work.","The sea, the stars, the night wind in waste places, mean more to me than even the human beings I love best.","The legacy of Greece to Western philosophy is Western philosophy.","[Regarding] the convention that clergymen are more virtuous than other men. Any average selection of mankind, set apart and told that it excels the rest in virtue, must tend to sink below the average.","John Locke invented common sense, and only Englishmen have had it ever since!","Ethical metaphysics is fundamentally an attempt, however disguised, to give legislative force to our own wishes.","I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue.","Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.","If the State does not acquire supremacy over [vast private] enterprises, it becomes their puppet, and they become the real State.","The philosophies that have been inspired by scientific technique are power philosophies, and tend to regard everything non-human as mere raw material. Ends are no longer considered; only the skillfulness of the process is valued. This also is a form of madness. It is, in our day, the most dangerous form, and the one against which a sane philosophy should provide an antidote","As soon as we abandon our own reason, and are content to rely upon authority, there is no end to our troubles.","We are all prone to the malady of the introvert who with the manifold spectacle of the world spread out before him, turns away and gazes only upon the emptiness within.","The secret of happiness is this: let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile.","We love our habits more than our income, often more than our life.","The examination system, and the fact that instruction is treated mainly as a training for a livelihood, leads the young to regard knowledge from a purely utilitarian point of view as the road to money, not as the gateway to wisdom.","The fundamental concept in social science is Power, in the same sense in which Energy is the fundamental concept in physics.","The wise man thinks about his troubles only when there is some purpose in doing so; at other times he thinks about other things, or, if it is night, about nothing at all.","Analytic It is clear that the definition of \\"logic\\" or \\"mathematics\\" must be sought by trying to give a new definition of the old notion of \\"analytic\\" propositions.","Hatred of enemies is easier and more intense than love of friends.  But from men who are more anxious to injure opponents than to benefit the world at large no great good is to be expected.","Indemnity for the past and security for the future.","Only in thought is man a God; in action and desire we are the slaves of circumstance.","3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime,  9 is a paradox; as is a paradox why the number 1 is not prime if it has no other divisors besides himself.","We know too much and feel too little. At least, we feel too little of those creative emotions from which a good life springs.","The true function of logic ... as applied to matters of experience ... is analytic rather than constructive; taken a priori, it shows the possibility of hitherto unsuspected alternatives more often than the impossibility of alternatives which seemed prima facie possible. Thus, while it liberates imagination as to what the world may be, it refuses to legislate as to what the world is","What science cannot discover, mankind cannot know.","The mind is a strange machine which can combine the materials offered to it in the most astonishing ways.","Never try to discourage thinking, for you are sure to succeed.","Very few men can be genuinely happy in a life involving continual self-assertion against the skepticism of the mass of mankind, unless they can shut themselves up in a coterie and forget the cold outer world. The man of science has no need of a coterie, since he is thought well of by everybody except his colleagues. The artist, on the contrary, is in the painful situation of having to choose between being despised and being despicable.","I believe in using words, not fists. I believe in my outrage knowing people are living in boxes on the street. I believe in honesty. I believe in a good time. I believe in good food. I believe in sex.","Government can easily exist without laws, but law cannot exist without government.","But as the work proceeded I was continually reminded of the fable about the elephant and the tortoise. Having constructed an elephant upon which the mathematical world could rest, I found the elephant tottering, and proceeded to construct a tortoise to keep the elephant from falling. But the tortoise was not more secure than the elephant, and after some twenty years of very arduous toil, I came to the conclusion that there was nothing more that I could do in the way of making mathematical knowledge indubitable.","One must care about a world one will not see.","A truer image of the world, I think, is obtained by picturing things as entering into the stream of time from an eternal world outside, than from a view which regards time as the devouring tyrant of all that is.","I wish to propose for the reader\'s favourable consideration a doctrine which may, I fear, appear wildly paradoxical and subversive. The doctrine in question is this: that it is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it true.","Awareness of universals is called conceiving, and a universal of which we are aware is called a concept.","The observer, when he seems to himself to be observing a stone, is really, if physics is to be believed, observing the effects of the stone upon himself.","Our great democracies still tend to think that a stupid man is more likely to be honest than a clever man.","As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one can prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think that I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because, when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.","If all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it is difficult not to demand of life more than it has to give.","Envy, in fact, is one form of a vice, partly moral, partly intellectual, which consists in seeing things never in themselves, but only in their relations.","The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm.","Too little liberty brings stagnation, and too much brings chaos.","A logical theory may be tested by its capacity for dealing with puzzles, and it is a wholesome plan, in thinking about logic, to stock the mind with as many puzzles as possible, since these serve much the same purpose as is served by experiments in physical science.","It is only through imagination that men become aware of what the world might be; without it, \u2018progress\u2019 would become mechanical and trivial.","Very many people spend money in ways quite different from those that their natural tastes would enjoin, merely because the respect of their neighbors depends upon their possession of a good car and their ability to give good dinners. As a matter of fact, any man who can obviously afford a car but genuinely prefers travels or a good library will in the end be much more respected than if he behaved exactly like everyone else.","Nothing is so exhausting as indecision, and nothing is so futile.","Self-respect will keep a man from being abject when he is in the power of enemies, and will enable him to feel that he may be in the right when the world is against him.","The scientific attitude of mind involves a sweeping away of all other desires in the interest of the desire to know.","A life without adventure is likely to be unsatisfying, but a life in which adventure is allowed to take whatever form it will is sure to be short.","Contempt for happiness is usually contempt for other people\'s happiness, and is an elegant disguise for hatred of the human race.","I have found, for example, that if I have to write upon sum rather difficult topic, the best plan is to think about it with very great intensity-the greatest intensity of which I am capable-for a few hours or days, and at the end of that time give orders, so to speak (to my subconscious mind) that the work is to proceed underground. After some months I return consciously to the topic and find that the work has been done.","That Plato\'s Republic should have been admired, on its political side, by decent people, is perhaps the most astonishing example of literary snobbery in all history.","Without civic morality communities perish; without personal morality their survival has no value.","If the youth is content to abandon his previous associates and to throw in his lot whole-heartedly with the rulers, he may, after suitable tests, be promoted, but if he shows any regrettable solidarity with his previous associates, the rulers will reluctantly conclude that there is nothing to be done with him except to send him to the lethal chamber before his ill-disciplined intelligence has had time to spread revolt. This will be a painful duty to the rulers, but I think they will not shrink from performing it.","The people who are regarded as moral luminaries are those who forego ordinary pleasures themselves and find compensation in interfering with the pleasures of others.","Reason is a harmonising, controlling force rather than a creative one.","Mathematics is, I believe, the chief source of the belief in eternal and exact truth, as well as a sensible intelligible world.","We know too much and feel too little.","Conquer the world by intelligence, and not merely by being slavishly subdued by the terror that comes from it.","There seems scarcely any limit to what could be done in the way of producing a good world, if only men would use science wisely.","Next to enjoying ourselves, the next greatest pleasure consists in preventing others from enjoying themselves, or, more generally, in the acquisition of power.","William James describes a man who got the experience from laughing-gas; whenever he was under its influence, he knew the secret of the universe, but when he came to, he had forgotten it. At last, with immense effort, he wrote down the secret before the vision had faded. When completely recovered, he rushed to see what he had written. It was \'A smell of petroleum prevails throughout\'.","I say people who feel they must have a faith or religion in order to face life are showing a kind of cowardice, which in any other sphere would be considered contemptible. But when it is in the religious sphere it is thought admirable, and I cannot admire cowardice whatever sphere it is in.","Obscenity is whatever happens to shock some elderly and ignorant magistrate.","The wise use of leisure, it must be conceded, is a product of civilization and education.","Americans need rest, but do not know it. I believe this to be a large part of the explanation of the crime wave in the United States.","A word is used \\"correctly\\" when the average hearer will be affected by it in the way intended. This is a psychological, not a literary, definition of \\"correctness\\". The literary definition would substitute, for the average hearer, a person of high education living a long time ago; the purpose of this definition is to make it difficult to speak or write correctly.","Laughter is the most inexpensive and most effective wonder drug. Laughter is a universal medicine.","Collective wisdom, alas, is no adequate substitute for the intelligence of individuals. Individuals who opposed received opinions have been the source of all progress, both moral and intellectual. They have been unpopular, as was natural.","It will be found, as men grow more tolerant in their instincts, \\nthat many uniformities now insisted upon are useless and even harmful.","Dogmatism and skepticism are both, in a sense, absolute philosophies; one is certain of knowing, the other of not knowing. What philosophy should dissipate is certainty, whether of knowledge or ignorance.","When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.","To be able to fill leisure intelligently is the last product of civilization, and at present very few people have reached this level.","Psychology often becomes the disease of which it should be the cure.","What vanity needs for its satisfaction is glory, and it\'s easy to have glory without power.","What is best in mathematics deserves not merely to be learnt as a task, but to assimilated as a part of daily thought, and brought again and again before the mind with ever-renewed encouragement.","The free intellect is the chief engine of human progress.","Ironclads and Maxim guns must be the ultimate arbiters of metaphysical truth.","The essence of good manners consists in making it clear that one has no wish to hurt. When it is clearly necessary to hurt, it must be done in such a way as to make it evident that the necessity is felt to be regrettable.","I am looking forward very much to getting back to Cambridge, and being able to say what I think and not to mean what I say: two things which at home are impossible. Cambridge is one of the few places where one can talk unlimited nonsense and generalities without anyone pulling one up or confronting one with them when one says just the opposite the next day.","It seems clear to me that marriage ought to be constituted by children, and relations not involving children ought to be ignored by the law and treated as indifferent by public opinion. It is only through children that relations cease to be a purely private matter.","[Freedom] is the greatest of political goods. I do not say freedom is the greatest of all goods: the best things come from within they are such things as creative art, and love, and thought. Such things can be helped or hindered by political conditions, but not actually produced by them; and freedom is, both in itself and in its relation to these other goods the best thing that political and economic conditions can secure.","The supreme maxim in scientific philosophising is this: wherever possible, logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred entities.","A world without delight and without affection is a world destitute of value.","No rules, however wise, are a substitute for affection and tact.","To choose one sock from each of infinitely many pairs of socks requires the Axiom of Choice, but for shoes the Axiom is not needed.","The whole realm of thought and opinion is utterly unsuited to public control; it ought to be as free, and as spontaneous as is possible. The state is justified in insisting that children shall be educated, but it is not justified in forcing their education to proceed on a uniform plan and to be directed to the production of a dead level of glib uniformity.","When one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others.","Only six need be attempted.","The essence of education is that it is a change effected in the organism to satisfy the operator.","Any philosophy worth taking seriously would have to be built upon a firm foundation of unyielding despair.","None but a coward dares to boast that he has never known fear.","The slave is doomed to worship time and fate and death, because they are greater than anything he finds in himself, and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour.","A drop of water is not immortal; it can be resolved into oxygen and hydrogen. If, therefore, a drop of water were to maintain that it had a quality of aqueousness which would survive its dissolution we should be inclined to be skeptical. In like manner we know that the brain is not immortal.","Against the vast majority of my countrymen, even at this moment, in the name of humanity and civilization, I protest against our share in the destruction of Germany. A month ago Europe was a peaceful comity of nations; if an Englishman killed a German, he was hanged. Now, if an Englishman kills a German, or if a German kills an Englishman, he is a patriot, who has deserved well of his country.","The more you complain the longer God lets you live","While the dogmatist is harmful, the sceptic is useless ...; one is certain of knowing, the other of not knowing. What philosophy should dissipate is certainty, whether of knowledge or of ignorance. Knowledge is not so precise a concept as is commonly thought. Instead of saying \'I know this\', we ought to say \'I more or less know something more or less like this\'. ... Knowledge in practical affairs has not the certainty or the precision of arithmetic.","If a law were passed giving six months to every writer of a first book, only the good ones would do it.","The fundamental defect of Christian ethics consists in the fact that it labels certain classes of acts \'sins\' and others \'virtue\' on grounds that have nothing to do with their social consequences.","More cranks take up unfashionable errors than unfashionable truths.","Christianity offers reasons for not fearing death or the universe, and in so doing it fails to teach adequately the virtue of courage.","I am not myself in any degree ashamed of having changed my opinions.","It\'s not what you have lost, but what you have left that counts.","There is a further advantage [to hydrogen bombs]: the supply of uranium in the planet is very limited, and it might be feared that it would be used up before the human race was exterminated, but now that the practically unlimited supply of hydrogen can be utilized, there is considerable reason to hope that homo sapiens may put an end to himself, to the great advantage of such less ferocious animals as may survive. But it is time to return to less cheerful topics.","When one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others. It is much more nearly certain that we are assembled here tonight than it is that this or that political party is in the right. Certainly there are degrees of certainty, and one should be very careful to emphasize that fact, because otherwise one is landed in an utter skepticism, and complete skepticism would, of course, be totally barren and completely useless.","Change is one thing, progress is another.","Nine-tenths of the activities of a modern Government are harmful; therefore the worse they are performed, the better.","We may say, in a broad way, that Greek philosophy down to Aristotle expresses the mentality appropriate to the City State; that Stoicism is appropriate to a cosmopolitan despotism; that stochastic philosophy is an intellectual expression of the Church as an organization; that philosophy since Descartes, or at any rate since Locke, tends to embody the prejudices of the commercial middle class; and that Marxism and Fascism are the philosophies appropriate to the modern industrial state.","Animal rights, taken to their logical conclusion, mean votes for oysters.","The Ten Commandments should be headed like an examination paper: No more than six to be attempted.","It would have been very much better for the world if Britain had remained neutral and the Germans had won a quick victory. We should not have had either the Nazis or the Communists if that had happened.","No opinion has ever been too errant to become a creed.","As soon as we abandon our own reason, and are content to rely upon authority, there is no end to our trouble. . . . No Catholic, for instance, takes seriously the text which says that a Bishop should be the husband of one wife.","Fanaticism is the danger of the world, and always has been, and has done untold harm. I might almost say that I was fanatical against fanaticism.","Happiness, as is evident, depends partly upon external circumstances and partly upon oneself.","The use of self control is like the use of brakes on train. It is useful when you find yourself in wrong direction but merely harmful when the direction is right","Moreover, the attitude that one ought to believe such and such a proposition, independently of the question whether there is evidence in its favor, is an attitude which produces hostility to evidence and causes us to close our minds to every fact that does not suit our prejudices.","Of these austerer virtues the love of truth is the chief, and in mathematics, more than elsewhere, the love of truth may find encouragement for waning faith. Every great study is not only an end in itself, but also a means of creating and sustaining a lofty habit of mind; and this purpose should be kept always in view throughout the teaching and learning of mathematics.","Perhaps the nuclear physicists have come so near to the ultimate secrets that He thinks it time to bring their activities to a stop. And what simpler method could He devise than to let them carry their ingenuity to the point where they exterminate the human race?","Shakespeare . . . If he does not give you delight, you had better ignore him [if you can].","Tobacco . . . is not prohibited in the Scriptures, though, as Samuel Butler points out, St. Paul would no doubt have denounced it if he had known of it.","Vanity is a motive of immense potency.","We are told that Sin consists in acting contrary to God\'s commands, but we are also told that God is omnipotent. . . . This leads to frightful results. . . . The British State considers it the duty of an Englishman to kill people who are not English whenever a collection of elderly gentlemen in Westminster tells him to do so. . . . Church and State are placable enemies of both intelligence and virtue.","We have almost reached the point where praise of rationality is held to mark a man as an old fogey regrettably surviving from a bygone age.","We must be sceptical even of our scepticism.","Philosophy bakes no bread","The power of thought, the vast regions it can master.","When two great powers disagree about anything - it doesn\'t matter what - they must find a way to settle it somehow by arbitration or by negotiation, not by war or threat of war.","Joy of life... depends upon a certain spontaneity in regard to sex. Where sex is repressed, only work remains, and a gospel of work for work\'s sake never produced any work worth doing.","Artists are on the average less happy than men of science.","Half the useful work in the world consists of combating the harmful work.","One is always a little afraid of love, but above all, one is afraid of pain or causing pain.","Each act of cruelty is eternally a part of the universe; nothing that happens later can make that act good rather than bad, or can confer perfection on the whole of which it is a part.","If everything has a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just be the world as God.","BERTRAND RUSSELL, The Philosophy of Logical Atomism We\'ve associated that word philosophy with academic study that in its own way has gotten so far beyond the layman that if you read contemporary philosophy you\'ve no clue, because it\'s almost become math. And it\'s odd that if you don\'t do that and you call yourself a philosopher that you always get \'homespun\' attached to it.","Ethics is in origin the art of recommending to others the sacrifices required for cooperation with oneself.","I believe myself that romantic love is the source of the most intense delights that life has to offer. In the relation of a man and woman who love each other with passion and imagination and tenderness, there is something of inestimable value, to be ignorant of which is a great misfortune to any human being.","Thomas Aquinas states parenthetically, as something entirely obvious, that men are more rational than women. For my part, I see no evidence of this.","Those who advocate common usage in philosophy sometimes speak in a manner that suggests the mystique of the \'common man.\'","Thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit.","Respectability, regularity, and routine - the whole cast-iron discipline of a modern industrial society - have atrophied the artistic impulse, and imprisoned love so that it can no longer be generous and free and creative, but must be either stuffy or furtive.","[The church] is in its major part an opponent still of progress and improvement in all the ways that diminish suffering in the world, because it has chosen to label as morality a certain narrow set of rules of conduct which have nothing to do with human happiness; and when you say that this or that ought to be done because it would make for human happiness, they think that has nothing to do with the matter at all. \\"What has human happiness to do with morals? The object of morals is not to make people happy.","I do wish I believed in the life eternal, for it makes me quite miserable to think man is merely a kind of machine endowed, unhappily for himself, with consciousness.","Moral progress has consisted in the main of protest against cruel customs, and of attempts to enlarge human sympathy.","When we have told how things behave when they are electrified, and under what circumstances they are electrified, we have told all there is to know","The doctrine (of) maintaining that the language of daily life, with words used in their ordinary meanings, suffices for philosophy . . . I find myself totally unable to accept . . . . Because it makes almost inevitable the perpetuation amongst philosophers of the muddle-headedness they have taken over from common sense.","The Stoic assures us that what is happening now will happen over and over again. [If so, Providende would] ultimately grow weary through despair.","The white tails of rabbits, according to some theologians, have a purpose, namely to make it easier for sportsmen to shoot them.","In considering irregular appearances, there are certain very natural mistakes which must be avoided.","It seems to be the fate of idealists to obtain what they have struggled for in a form which destroys their ideals.","The coward wretch whose hand and heart Can bear to torture aught below, Is ever first to quail and start From the slightest pain or equal foe.","To speak seriously: the standards of \\"goodness\\" which are generally recognized by public opinion are not those which are calculated to make the world a happier place. This is due to a variety of causes, of which the chief is tradition, and the next most powerful is the unjust power of dominant classes.","Human nature being what it is, people will insist upon getting some pleasure out of life.","It is a natural propensity to attribute misfortune to someone\'s malignity.","We do not like to be robbed of an enemy; we want someone to hate when we suffer. It is so depressing to think that we suffer because we are fools; yet, taking mankind in the mass, that is the truth.","So in everything: power lies with those who control finance, not with those who know the matter upon which the money is to be spent. Thus, the holders of power are, in general, ignorant and malevolent, and the less they exercise their power the better.","Love can only flourish as long as it is free and spontaneous; it tends to be killed by the thought that it is a duty. To say that it is your duty to love so-and-so is the surest way to cause you to hate him or her.","Whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities.","Is a man what he seems to the astronomer, a tiny lump of impure carbon and water crawling impotently on a small and unimportant planet? Or is he what he appears to Hamlet? Is he perhaps both as once?","The wise man will be as happy as circumstances permit, and if he finds the contemplation of the universe painful beyond a point, he will contemplate something else instead.","Altogether it will be found that a quiet life is characteristic of great men, and that their pleasures have not been of the sort that would look exciting to the outward eye.","If we were all given by magic the power to read each other\u2019s thoughts, I suppose the first effect would be almost all friendships would be dissolved; the second effect, however, might be excellent, for a world without any friends would be felt to be intolerable, and we should learn to like each other without needing a veil of illusion to conceal from ourselves that we did not think each other absolutely perfect.","All the time that he can spare from the adornment of his person, he devotes to the neglect of his duties.","When it was first proposed to establish laboratories at Cambridge, Todhunter, the mathematician, objected that it was unnecessary for students to see experiments performed, since the results could be vouched for by their teachers, all of them of the highest character, and many of them clergymen of the Church of England.","What is matter? Never mind.","The first dogma which I came to disbelieve was that of free will. It seemed to me that all notions of matter were determined by the laws of dynamics and could not therefore be influenced by human wills.","The road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work.","Either man will abolish war, or war will abolish man.","To fear love is to fear life.","The best practical advice I can give to the present generation is to practice the virtue which the Christians call love.","Real life is, to most men, a long second best, a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the possible.","Worry is a form of fear.","There are infinite possibilities of error, and more cranks take up fashionable untruths than unfashionable truths.","There is an artist imprisoned in each one of us. Let him loose to spread joy everywhere.","The man who only loves beautiful things is dreaming, whereas the man who knows absolute beauty is wide awake.","The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.","To save the world requires faith and courage: faith in reason, and courage to proclaim what reason shows to be true.","Philosophy arises from an unusually obstinate attempt to arrive at real knowledge. What passes for knowledge in ordinary life suffers from three defects: it is cocksure, vague and self-contradictory. The first step towards philosophy consists in becoming aware of these defects, not in order to rest content with a lazy scepticism, but in order to substitute an amended kind of knowledge which shall be tentative, precise and self-consistent.","The reformative effect of punishment is a belief that dies hard, chiefly I think, because it is so satisfying to our sadistic impulses.","I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy \u2013 ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of that joy. ... I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined.","Abstract work, if one wishes to do it well, must be allowed to destroy one\'s humanity; one raises a monument which is at the same time a tomb, in which, voluntarily, one slowly inters oneself.","Curious learning not only makes unpleasant things less unpleasant but also makes pleasant things more pleasant.","Science, by itself, cannot supply us with an ethic. It can show us how to achieve a given end, and it may show us that some ends cannot be achieved.","The first step in wisdom, as well as in morality, is to open the windows of the ego as wide as possible.","When the journey from means to end is not too long, the means themselves are enjoyed if the end is ardently desired.","The demand for certainty is one which is natural to man, but is nevertheless an intellectual vice. If you take your children for a picnic on a doubtful day, they will demand a dogmatic answer as to whether it will be fine or wet, and be disappointed in you when you cannot be sure.","The frequency with which a man experiences lust depends upon his own physical condition, whereas the occasion which rouse such feelings in him depend upon the social conventions to which he is accustomed","We ought to look the world frankly in the face.","Admiration of the proletariat, like that of dams, power stations, and aeroplanes, is part of the ideology of the machine age.","There is an element of the busybody in our conception of virtue: unless a man makes himself a nuisance to a great many people, we do not think he can be an exceptionally good man.","Science can teach us, and I think our hearts can teach us, no longer to look around for imaginary supporters, no longer to invent allies in the sky, but rather to look to our own efforts here below to make the world a fit place to live.","The first effect of emancipation from the Church was not to make men think rationally, but to open their minds to every sort of antique nonsense","On the one hand, philosophy is to keep us thinking about things that we may come to know, and on the other hand to keep us modestly aware of how much that seems like knowledge isn\'t knowledge","I believe that the abolition of private ownership of land and capital is a necessary step toward any world in which the nations are to live at peace with one another.","Without effort and change, human life cannot remain good. It is not a finished Utopia that we ought to desire, but a world where imagination and hope are alive and active.","In emancipation from the fears that beset the slave of circumstance he will experience a profound joy, and through all the vicissitudes of his outward life he will remain in the depths of his being a happy man.","Modern American politicians have the same cowardice about denying an equally bloodthirsty even sillier god, Jehovah.\\nNone of us would seriously consider the possibility that all the gods of Homer really exist... I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were atheists. In regard to the Christian God, I should, I think, take exactly the same line.","The teaching of Christ, as it appears in the Gospels, has had extraordinarily little to do with the ethics of Christians.","St. Paul introduced an entirely novel view of marriage, that it existed primarily to prevent the sin of fornication. It is just as if one were to maintain that the sole reason for baking bread is to prevent people from stealing cake.","Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it?","To be able to concentrate for a considerable time is essential to difficult achievement.","I suggest to young professors that their first work should be written in a jargon only to be understood by the erudite few. With that behind them, they can ever after say what they have to say in a language \'understand of the people.\'","The theoretical understanding of the world, which is the aim of philosophy, is not a matter of great practical importance to animals, or to savages, or even to most civilised men.","Science, by itself, cannot supply us with an ethic. It can show us how to achieve a given end, and it may show us that some ends cannot be achieved. But among ends that can be achieved our choice must be decided by other than purely scientific considerations. If a man were to say, \\"I hate the human race, and I think it would be a good thing if it were exterminated,\\" we could say, \\"Well, my dear sir, let us begin the process with you.\\" But this is hardly argument, and no amount of science could prove such a man mistaken.","Although this may seem a paradox, all exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation. When a man tells you that he knows the exact truth about anything, you are safe in inferring that he is an inexact man. Every careful measurement in science is always given with the probable error ... every observer admits that he is likely wrong, and knows about how much wrong he is likely to be.","[There has been] every kind of cruelty practiced upon all sorts of people in the name of religion.","Punctuality is a quality the need of which is bound up with social co-operation. It has nothing to do with the relation of the soul to God, or with mystic insight, or with any of the matters with which the more elevated and spiritual moralists are concerned.","We know that the exercise of virtue should be its own reward, and it seems to follow that the enduring of it on the part of the patient should be its own punishment.","We may often do as we please - but we cannot please as we please.","If you question any candid person who is no longer young, he is very likely to tell you that, having tasted life in this world, he has no wish to begin again as a \\"new boy\\" in another.","For the learning of every virtue there is an appropriate discipline, and for the learning of suspended judgment the best discipline is philosophy.","Religions which have any very strong hold over men\'s actions have generally some instinctive basis.","By self-interest, Man has become gregarious, but in instinct he has remained to a great extent solitary; hence the need of religion and morality to reinforce self-interest.","I have throughout been curious about how much we can be said to know and with what degree of certainty or doubtfulness.","Heretical views arise when the truth is uncertain, and it is only when the truth is uncertain that censorship is invoked.","The idea that the poor should have leisure has always been shocking to the rich.","Thee will find out in time that I have a great love of professing vile sentiments, I don\'t know why, unless it springs from long efforts to avoid priggery.","I believe that Communism is necessary to the world, and I believe that the heroism of Russia has fired men\'s hopes in a way which was essential to the realization of Communism in the future. Regarded as a splendid attempt, without which ultimate success would have been very improbable, Bolshevism deserves the gratitude and admiration of all the progressive part of mankind.","I must confess that I am deeply troubled. I fear that human beings are intent upon acting out a vast deathwish and that it lies with us now to make every effort to promote resistance to the insanity and brutality of policies which encompass the extermination of hundreds of millions of human beings.","Life seems to me essentially passion, conflict, rage. It is only intellect that keeps me sane; perhaps this makes me overvalue intellect against feeling.","it [is] possible to suppose that, if Russia is allowed to have peace, an amazing industrial development may take place, making Russia a rival of the United States.","A European who goes to New York and Chicago sees the future... when he goes to Asia he sees the past.","The typical Westerner wishes to be the cause of as many changes as possible in his environment; the typical Chinaman wishes to enjoy as much and as delicately as possible.","I do not think any reasonable person can doubt that in India, China and Japan, if the knowledge of birth control existed, the birthrate would fall very rapidly","I do so hate to leave this world.","He will see himself and life and the world as truly as our human limitations will permit; realizing the brevity and minuteness of human life, he will realize also that in individual minds is concentrated whatever of value the known universe contains.","I cannot favour laws such as that of Idaho, which allows sterilization of \'mental defectives, epileptics, habitual criminals, moral degenerates, and sex perverts.\' The last two categories here are very vague . . . The law of Idaho would have justified the sterilization of Socrates, Plato, Julius Caesar, and St. Paul.","So far I have been speaking of theoretical science, which is an attempt to understand the world. Practical science, which is an attempt to change the world, has been important from the first, and has continually increased in importance, until it has almost ousted theoretical science from men\'s thoughts.","All knowledge, we feel, must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs; and if these are rejected, nothing is left.","There are still many people in America who regard depressions as acts of God. I think Keynes proved that the responsibility for these occurrences does not rest with Providence.","Orthodoxy is the death of intelligence.","When white men first effect contact with some unspoilt race of savages, they offer them all kinds of benefits, from the light of the gospel to pumpkin pie. These, however, much as we may regret it, most savages receive with indifference. What they really value among the gifts that we bring to them is intoxicating liquor which enables them, for the first time in their lives, to have the illusion for a few brief moments that it is better to be alive than dead.","Science has made unrestricted national sovereignty incompatible with human survival. The only possibilities are now world government or death.","To discover a system for the avoidance of war is a vital need of our civilisation.","For my part, the thing I would wish to obtain from money would be leisure with security. But what the typical modern man desires to get with it is more money, with a view to ostentation, splendour, and the outshining of those who have hitherto been his equals.","While I am as convinced a Socialist as the most ardent Marxian, I do not regard Socialism as a gospel of proletarian revenge, nor even, primarily, as a means of securing economic justice. I regard it primarily as an adjustment to machine production demanded by considerations of common sense, and calculated to increase the happiness, not only of proletarians, but of all except a tiny minority of the human race.","Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world needs most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life of arduous struggle.","In America everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors, since all men are equal, but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors, for, from the time of Jefferson onward, the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards, not downwards.","It is not my prayer and humility that you cause things to go as you wish, but by acquiring a knowledge of natural laws.","Machines have altered our way of life, but not our instincts. Consequently, there is maladjustment.","Understanding human nature must be the basis of any real improvement in human life. Science has done wonders in mastering the laws of the physical world, but our own nature is much less understood, as yet, than the nature of stars and electrons. When science learns to understand human nature, it will be able to bring a happiness into our lives which machines and the physical sciences have failed to create.","The Church no longer contends that knowledge is in itself sinful, though it did so in its palmy days; but the acquisition of knowledge, even though not sinful, is dangerous, since it may lead to pride of intellect, and hence to a questioning of the Christian dogma.","One of the commonest things to do with savings is to lend them to some Government. In view of the fact that the bulk of the public expenditure of most civilized Governments consists in payment for past wars or preparation for future wars, the man who lends his money to a Government is in the same position as the bad men in Shakespeare who hire murderers. The net result of the man\'s economical habits is to increase the armed forces of the State to which he lends his savings. Obviously it would be better if he spent the money, even if he spent it in drink or gambling.","There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge and wisdom. Shall we instead choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? I appeal as a human being to human beings; remember your humanity, and forget the rest.","Never let yourself be diverted, either by what you wish to believe, or what you think could have beneficent social effects if it were believed; but look only and solely at what are the facts.","The man who pursues happiness wisely will aim at the possession of a number of subsidiary interests in addition to those central ones upon which his life is built.","It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise.","It is because modern education is so seldom inspired by a great hope that it so seldom achieves great results. The wish to preserve the past rather that the hope of creatingfuture dominates the minds of those who control the teaching of the young.","Love as a relation between men and women was ruined by the desire to make sure of the legitimacy of children.","You must believe that you can help bring about a better world. A good society is produced only by good individuals, just as truly as a majority in a presidential election is produced by the votes of single electors.","I resolved from the beginning of my quest that I would not be misled by sentiment and desire into beliefs for which there was no good evidence.","There are two ways of avoiding fear: one is by persuading ourselves that we are immune from disaster, and the other is by the practice of sheer courage. The latter is difficult, and to everybody becomes impossible at a certain point. The former has therefore always been more popular. Primitive magic has the purpose of securing safety, either by injuring enemies, or by protecting oneself by talismans, spells, or incantations.","Our instinctive emotions are those that we have inherited from a much more dangerous world, and contain, therefore, a larger portion of fear than they should.","The twin conceptions of sin and vindictive punishment seem to be at the root of much that is most vigorous, both in religion and politics.","This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the second chance were offered me.","One must expect a war between U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. which will begin with the total destruction of London. I think the war will last 30 years, and leave a world without civilised people, from which everything will have to build afresh - a process taking (say) 500 years.","The desire to understand the world and the desire to reform it are the two great engines of progress, without which human society would stand still or retrogress.","I am as drunk as a lord, but then, I am one, so what does it matter ?","It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions makes it impossible to earn a living.","Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth - more than ruin, more even than death.","The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists - that is why they invented hell.","Bacon not only despised the syllogism, but undervalued mathematics, presumably as insufficiently experimental. He was virulently hostile to Aristotle , but he thought very highly of Democritus , Although he did not deny that the course of nature exemplifies a Divine purpose, he objected to any admixture of teleological explanation in the actual investigation of phenomena; everything, he held, should be explained as following necessarily from efficient causes .","I do not believe that I am now dreaming, but I cannot prove that I am not. I am, however, quite certain that I am having certain experiences, whether they be those of a dream or those of waking life.","The modern man thinks that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its own sake.","Africans had to be taught that nudity is wicked; this was done very cheaply by missionaries.","I do not pretend to start with precise questions. I do not think you can start with anything precise. You have to achieve such precision as you can, as you go along.","Every isolated passion, is, in isolation, insane; sanity may be defined as synthesis of insanities. Every dominant passion generates a dominant fear, the fear of its non-fulfillment. Every dominant fear generates a nightmare, sometimes in form of explicit and conscious fanaticism, sometimes in paralyzing timidity, sometimes in an unconscious or subconscious terror which finds expression only in dreams. The man who wishes to preserve sanity in a dangerous world should summon in his own mind a parliament of fears, in which each in turn is voted absurd by all the others.","A good social system is not to be secured by making people unselfish, but, by making their own vital impulses fit in with other peoples. This is feasible. Those who have produced stoic philosophies have all had enough to eat and drink. I feel I shall find the truth on my deathbed and be surrounded by people too stupid to understand\u2014fussing about medicines instead of searching for wisdom. I hate being all tidy like a book in a library where nobody reads \u2013 prison is horribly like that.","dont let the old break you; let the love make you","What is new in our time is the increased power of the authorities to enforce their prejudices.","The process of philosophizing, to my mind, consists mainly in passing from those obvious, vague, ambiguous things, that we feel quite sure of, to something precise, clear, definite, which by reflection and analysis we find is involved in the vague thing that we start from, and is, so to speak, the real truth of which that vague thing is a sort of shadow.","Suppose atomic bombs had reduced the population of the world to one brother and sister; should they let the human race die out?","The late F. W. H. Myers used to tell how he asked a man at a dinner table what he thought would happen to him when he died. The man tried to ignore the question, but, on being pressed, replied: \\"Oh well, I suppose I shall inherit eternal bliss, but I wish you wouldn\'t talk about such unpleasant subjects.\\"","The whiter my hair becomes, the more ready people are to believe what I say.","Human life, its growth, its hopes, fears, loves, et cetera, are the result of accidents","Freedom comes only to those who no longer ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal goods that are subject to the mutations of time.","I went to Salt Lake City and the Mormons tried to convert me, but when I found they forbade tea and tobacco I thought it was no religion for me.","The State is a collection of officials, different for difference purposes, drawing comfortable incomes so long as the status quo is preserved. The only alteration they are likely to desire in the status quo is an increase of bureaucracy and the power of bureaucrats.","Aristotle is the last Greek philosopher who faces the world cheerfully; after him, all have, in one form or another, a philosophy of retreat.","The most essential characteristic of scientific technique is that it proceeds from experiment, not from tradition. The experimental habit of mind is a difficult one for most people to maintain; indeed, the science of one generation has already become the tradition of the next","One eminently orthodox Catholic divine laid it down that a confessor may fondle a nun\'s breasts, provided he does it without evil intent.","The desire for legitimate offspring is, in fact, according to the Catholic Church, the only motive which can justify sexual intercourse.","The Eugenic Society . . . is perpetually bewailing the fact that wage-earners breed faster than middle-class people.","The newspapers at one time said that I was dead but after carefully examining the evidence I came to the conclusion that this statement was false.","It\'s easy to fall in love. The hard part is finding someone to catch you.","No matter how eloquently a dog may bark, he cannot tell you that his parents were poor, but honest.","A marriage is likely to be called happy if neither party ever expected to get much happiness out of it.","Mankind is divided into two classes: those who, being artificial, praise nature, and those who, being natural, praise art.","In a just world, there would be no possibility of \'charity\'.","All traditional logic habitually assumes that precise symbols are being employed. It is therefore not applicable to this terrestial life but only to an imagined celestial existence... logic takes us nearer to heaven than other studies.","Cruelty is, in theory, a perfectly adequate ground for divorce, but it may be interpreted so as to become absurd.","Continuity of purpose is one of the most essential ingredients of happiness in the long run, and for most men that comes chiefly through their work.","Common sense, however it tries,\\n cannot avoid being surprised from time to time.","...impregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner, more in the light of a surgical operation, so that it will be thought not ladylike to have it performed in the natural manner.","Boys and girls should be taught respect for each other\'s liberty... and that jealousy and possessiveness kill love.","Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion go hand in hand.","This is one of those views which are so absolutely absurd that only very learned men could possibly adopt them.","I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing. There are others, which, one must suppose, opponents of birth control would prefer.","It would now be technically possible to unify the world, abolish war and poverty altogether, if men desired their own happiness more than the misery of their enemies.","For some reason which I have failed to understand, many people like the system [scientific totalitarianism] when it is Russian but disliked the very same system when it was German. I am compelled to think that this is due to the power of labels; these people like whatever is labelled \u2018Left\u2019 without examining whether the label has any justification.","There\'s a Bible on that shelf there. But I keep it next to Voltaire - poison and antidote.","It is one of the defects of modern higher education that it has become too much a training in the acquisition of certain kinds of skill, and too little an enlargement of the mind and heart by an impartial survey of the world.","There is no excuse for deceiving children. And when, as must happen in conventional families, they find that their parents have lied, they lose confidence in them and feel justified in lying to them.","The raw fruits of the earth were made for human sustenance. Even the white tails of rabbits, according to some theologians, have a purpose, namely to make it easier for sportsmen to shoot them. There are, it is true, some inconveniences: lions and tigers are too fierce, the summer is too hot, and the winter too cold. But these things only began after Adam ate the apple; I before that, all animals were vegetarians, and the season was always spring. If only Adam had been content with peaches and nectarines, grapes and pears and pineapples, these blessings would still be ours.","Public opinion is always more tyrannical towards those who obviously fear it than towards those who feel indifferent to it.","no one ever gossips about the virtues of others","There is no need to worry about mere size. We do not necessarily respect a fat man more than a thin man. Sir Isaac Newton was very much smaller than a hippopotamus, but we do not on that account value him less.","I can only say that, while my own opinions as to ethics do not satisfy me, other people\'s satisfy me still less.","Sir Arthur Eddington deduces religion from the fact that atoms do not obey the laws of mathematics. Sir James Jeans deduces it from the fact that they do.","Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found","The luxury to disparage freedom is the privilege of those who already possess it.","The more intense has been the religion of any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs.","As for earthquakes, though they were still formidable, they were so interesting that men of science could hardly regret them.","Modern technique has made it possible for leisure, within limits, to be not the prerogative of small privileged classes, but a right evenly distributed throughout the community. The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.","As men begin to grow civilized, they cease to be satisfied with mere taboos.","Civilized life, if it is to be stable, must provide a harmless outlets for the impulses which our remote ancestors satisfied in hunting. In Australia, where people are few, and rabbits are many, I watched the whole populace satisfying the primitive impulse in the primitive manner by the skilful slaughter of many thousands of rabbits.","Truth is for the gods; from our human point of view, it is an ideal, towards which we can approximate, but which we cannot hope to reach.","Force plays a much larger part in the government of the world than it did before 1914, and what is especially alarming, force tends increasingly to fall into the hands of those who are enemies of civilization.","Dr. Arnold . . . the admired reformer of public schools, came across some cranks who thought it a mistake to flog boys. Anyone reading his outburst of furious indignation against this opinion will be forced to the conclusion that he enjoyed inflicting floggings.","Right discipline consists, not in external compulsion, but in the habits of mind which lead spontaneously to desirable rather than undesirable activities.","History is valuable, to begin with, because it is true; and this, though not the whole of its value, is the foundation and condition of all the rest. That all knowledge, as such, is in some degree good, would appear to be at least probable; and the knowledge of every historical fact possesses this element of goodness, even if it posses no other.","To write tragedy, a man must feel tragedy. To feel tragedy, a man must be aware of the world in which he lives. Not only with his mind, but with his blood and sinews.","Ants and savages put strangers to death.","Memory demands an image.","The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.","When conscious activity is wholly concentrated on some one definite purpose, the ultimate result, for most people, is lack of balance accompanied by some form of nervous disorder.","Since Adam and Eve ate the apple, man has never refrained from any folly of which he was capable.","Almost all education has a political motive.","Philosophy, for Plato, is a kind of vision, the \'vision of truth\'...Everyone who has done any kind of creative work has experienced, in a greater or less degree, the state of mind in which, after long labour, truth or beauty appears, or seems to appear, in a sudden glory - it may only be about some small matter, or it may be about the universe. I think that most of the best creative work, in art, in science, in literature, and in philosophy, has been a result of just such a moment.","It is permissible with certain precautions to speak in print of coitus, but it is not permissible to employ the monosyllabic synonym for this word.","The use of force stands in need of control by a public neutral authority, in the interests of liberty no less than of justice. Within a nation, this public authority will naturally be the state; in relations between nations, if the present anarchy is to cease, it will have to be some international parliament.","The Mormons had a divine revelation in favour of polygamy, but under pressure from the United States Government they discovered that the revelation was not binding.","The pursuit of knowledge is, I think, mainly actuated by love of power. And so are all advances in scientific technique.","Philosophy is an unusually ingenious attempt to think fallaciously.","Remote from human passions, remote even from the pitiful facts of nature, the generations have gradually created an ordered cosmos [mathematics], where pure thought can dwell in its natural home.","Calculus required continuity, and continuity was supposed to require the infinitely little; but nobody could discover what the infinitely little might be.","The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation ... it is common to wish well to oneself, but in our technically unified world, wishing well to oneself is sure to be futile unless it is combined with wishing well to others.","Diversity is essential to happiness and in Utopia there is hardly any. This is a defect in all planned social systems.","Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty-a beauty cold and austere ... yet sublimely pure and capable of stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.","A habit of basing convictions upon evidence, and of giving to them only that degree or certainty which the evidence warrants, would, if it became general, cure most of the ills from which the world suffers.","There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that \\"remembered\\" a wholly unreal past. There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago.","Every living thing is a sort of imperialist, seeking to transform as much as possible of its environment into itself.","There are certain things that our age needs, and certain things that it should avoid. It needs compassion and a wish that mankind should be happy; it needs the desire for knowledge and the determination to eschew pleasant myths; it needs, above all, courageous hope and the impulse to creativeness.","Nothing of importance is ever achieved without discipline. I feel myself sometimes not wholly in sympathy with some modern educational theorists, because I think that they underestimate the part that discipline plays. But the discipline you have in your life should be one determined by your own desires and your own needs, not put upon you by society or authority.","Well, there are many religions, but I suppose they all worship the same God.","Hitler is an outcome of Rousseau.","Thee might observe incidentally that if the state paid for child-bearing it might and ought to require a medical certificate that the parents were such as to give a reasonable result of a healthy child -- this would afford a very good inducement to some sort of care for the race, and gradually as public opinion became educated by the law, it might react on the law and make that more stringent, until one got to some state of things in which there would be a little genuine care for the race, instead of the present haphazard higgledy-piggledy ways.","With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway about the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.","What the world needs is not dogma but an attitude of scientific inquiry.","You are a wicked motorcar, and I shall not give you any more petrol until you go.","Great God in Boots! \u2013 the ontological argument is sound!","There are three ways of securing a society that shall be stable as regards population. The first is that of birth control, the second that of infanticide or really destructive wars, and the third that of general misery except for a powerful minority.","Certain characteristics of the subject are clear. To begin with, we do not in this subject deal with particular things or particular properties: we deal formally with what can be said about any thing or any property. We are prepared to say that one and one are two, but not that Socrates and Plato are two.","The first essential character [of civilization], I should say, is forethought. This, indeed, is what mainly distinguishes men from brutes and adults from children.","Zeno was concerned with three problems... These are the problem of the infinitesimal, the infinite, and continuity.","I am delighted to know that Principia Mathematica can now be done by machinery. . . I am quite willing to believe that anything in deductive logic can be done by machinery.","The three main extra-rational activities in modern life are religion, war, and love. all these are extra-rational, but love is not anti-rational, that is to say, a reasonable man may reasonably rejoice in its existence","A widespread belief is more often likely to be foolish than sensible.","Every living thing is a sort of imperialist, seeking to transform as much as possible of its environment into itself . . . When we compare the (present) human population of the globe with . . . that of former times, we see that \\"chemical imperialism\\" has been . . . the main end to which human intelligence has been devoted.","Those who in principle oppose birth control are either incapable of arithmetic or else in favour of war, pestilence and famine as permanent features of human life.","In human relations one should penetrate to the core of loneliness in each person and speak to that.","In our complex world, there cannot be fruitful initiative without government, but unfortunately there can be government without initiative.","The dictum that human nature cannot be changed is one of those tiresome platitudes that conceal from the ignorant the depths of their own ignorance.","I am aware that many divines are far more marvelous than I am, and that I cannot wholly appreciate merits so far transcending my own. Nevertheless, even after making allowances under this head, I cannot but think that Omnipotence operating through all eternity might have produced something better.","Adventurous men enjoy shipwrecks, mutinies, earthquakes, conflagrations, and all kinds of unpleasant experiences. They say to themselves, for example, \'So this is what an earthquake is like,\' and it gives them pleasure to have their knowledge of the world increased by this new item.","I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by belief in the virtuousness of WORK, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in the organised diminution of work.","Teachers are more than any other group the guardians of civilization.","Logic must no more admit a unicorn than zoology can.","A million million years gives us some time to prepare for the end . . . let us make the best of it.","Americans need rest, but do not know it.","Among the Tibetans, one wife has many husbands, because men are too poor to support a whole wife.","Aristotle and Plato considered Greeks so innately superior to barbarians that slavery is justified so long as the master is Greek and the slave barbarian.","Escape from boredom is one of the really powerful desires of almost all human beings.","European travellers find the Japanese a smiling race.","How about Pithecanthropus Erectus? Was it really he who ate the apple? Or was it Homo Pekiniensis?","I am allowed to use plain English because everybody knows that I could use mathematical logic if I chose.","One of the chief triumphs of modern mathematics consists in having discovered what mathematics really is.","Man can be stimulated by hope or driven by fear, but the hope and the fear must be vivid and immediate if they are to be effective without producing weariness.","Right conduct can never, except by some rare accident, be promoted by ignorance or hindered by knowledge.","Opinions which justify cruelty are inspired by cruel impulses.","There is no difference between someone who eats too little and sees Heaven and someone who drinks too much and sees snakes.","Children, after being limbs of Satan in traditional theology and mystically illuminated angels in the minds of educational reformers, have reverted to being little devils; not theological demons inspired by the evil one, but scientific Freudian abominations inspired by the unconscious.","It is only in marriage with the world that our ideals can bear fruit; divorced from it, they remain barren.","Much of the most important evils that mankind have to consider are those which they inflict upon each other through stupidity or malevolence or both.","Ideas and principles that do harm are as a rule, though not always, cloaks for evil passions.","The significance of a fact is relative to [the general body of scientific] knowledge. To say that a fact is significant in science, is to say that it helps to establish or refute some general law; for science, though it starts from observation of the particular, is not concerned essentially with the particular, but with the general. A fact, in science, is not a mere fact, but an instance. In this the scientist differs from the artist, who, if he deigns to notice facts at all, is likely to notice them in all their particularity.","Science, in its ultimate ideal, consists of a set of propositions arranged in a hierarchy, the lowest level of the hierarchy being concerned with particular facts, and the highest with some general law, governing everything in the universe. The various levels in the hierarchy have a two-fold logical connection, travelling one up, one down; the upward connection proceeds by induction, the downward by deduction.","The method of \\"postulating\\" what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil.","This idea of weapons of mass extermination is utterly horrible and is something which no one with one spark of humanity can tolerate.","Our individual life is brief, and perhaps the whole life of mankind will be brief if measured in astronomical scale","Philosophy is that part of science which at present people chose to have opinions about, but which they have no knowledge about. Therefore every advance in knowledge robs philosophy of some problems which formerly it had ...and will belong to science.","All the conditions of happiness are realized in the life of the man of science.","We are ... led to a somewhat vague distinction between what we may call \\"hard\\" data and \\"soft\\" data. This distinction is a matter of degree, and must not be pressed; but if not taken too seriously it may help to make the situation clear. I mean by \\"hard\\" data those which resist the solvent influence of critical reflection, and by \\"soft\\" data those which, under the operation of this process, become to our minds more or less doubtful.","It is odd that neither the Church nor modern public opinion condemns petting, provided it stops short at a certain point. At what point sin begins is a matter as to which casuists differ. One eminently orthodox Catholic divine laid it down that a confessor may fondle a nun\'s breasts, provided he does it without evil intent. But I doubt whether modern authorities would agree with him on this point.","In the higher walks of politics the same sort of thing occurs. The statesman who has gradually concentrated all power within himself ... may have had anything but a public motive... The phrases which are customary on the platform and in the Party Press have gradually come to him to seem to express truths, and he mistakes the rhetoric of partisanship for a genuine analysis of motives... He retires from the world after the world has retired from him.","Arithmetic must be discovered in just the same sense in which Columbus discovered the West Indies, and we no more create numbers than he created the Indians.","But it is just this characteristic of simplicity in the laws of nature hitherto discovered which it would be fallacious to generalize, for it is obvious that simplicity has been a part cause of their discovery, and can, therefore, give no ground for the supposition that other undiscovered laws are equally simple.","Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say.","The fact that all Mathematics is Symbolic Logic is one of the greatest discoveries of our age; and when this fact has been established, the remainder of the principles of mathematics consists of the analysis of Symbolic Logic itself.","Unless a man has been taught what to do with success after getting it, the achievement of it must inevitably leave him a prey to boredom.","There is as much difference between a collection of mentally free citizens and a community molded by modern methods of propaganda as there is between a heap of raw materials and a battleship.","Dora and I are now married, but just as happy as we were before.","Our beliefs are, however, often contrary to fact.","Another merit of home is that it preserves the diversity between individuals. If we were all alike, it might be convenient for the bureaucrat and the statistician, but it would be very dull, and would lead to a very unprogressive society.","I cannot escape from the conclusion that the great ages of progress have depended upon a small number of individuals of transcendent ability.","Democracy has at least one merit, namely that a Member of Parliament cannot be stupider than his constituents, for the more stupid he is, the more stupid they were to elect him.","I think the subject which will be of most importance politically is mass psychology.... Its importance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods of propaganda. Of these the most influential is what is called \'education.\' Religion plays a part, though a diminishing one; the press, the cinema, and the radio play an increasing part.... It may be hoped that in time anybody will be able to persuade anybody of anything if he can catch the patient young and is provided by the State with money and equipment.","The human animal, like others, is adapted to a certain amount of struggle for life [and] the mere absence of effort from his life removes an essential ingredient of happiness. [. . .] He forgets that to be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.","We need a science to save us from science.","In spite of Death, the mark and seal of the parental control, Man is yet free, during his brief years, to examine, to criticise, to know, and in imagination to create. To him alone, in the world with which he is acquainted, this freedom belongs; and in this lies his superiority to the resistless forces that control his outward life.","... mathematical knowledge ... is, in fact, merely verbal knowledge. \\"3\\" means \\"2+1\\", and \\"4\\" means \\"3+1\\". Hence it follows (though the proof is long) that \\"4\\" means the same as \\"2+2\\". Thus mathematical knowledge ceases to be mysterious.","... the word \\"theory\\" ... was originally an Orphic word, which Cornford interprets as \\"passionate sympathetic contemplation\\" ... For Pythagoras, the \\"passionate sympathetic contemplation\\" was intellectual, and issued in mathematical knowledge ... To those who have reluctantly learnt a little mathematics in school this may seem strange; but to those who have experienced the intoxicating delight of sudden understanding that mathematics gives, from time to time, to those who love it, the Pythagorean view will seem completely natural.","It is not by delusion, however exalted, that mankind can prosper, but only by unswerving courage in the pursuit of truth.","Berkeley retains the merit of having shown that the existence of matter is capable of being denied without absurdity.","[Kant] was like many people: in intellectual matters he was skeptical, but in moral matters he believed imjplicitly in the maximx that he had imbibed at his mother\'s knee.","America remained a land of promise for lovers of freedom. Even Byron, at a moment when he was disgusted with Napoleon for not committing suicide, wrote an eloquent stanza in praise of Washington.","The institution of representative government to us seems an essential part of democracy, but the ancients never thought of it. Its immense merit was that it enabled a large constituency to exert indirect power, and thus made possible the distribution of political responsibility throughout the great states of modern times.","To the young I should offer two maxims: Don\'t accept superficial solutions of difficult problems. It is better to do a little good than much harm. I should not offer anything more specific; every young person should decide on his or her own credo.","In his youth, Wordsworth sympathized with the French Revolution, went to France, wrote good poetry and had a natural daughter. At this period, he was a bad man. Then he became good, abandoned his daughter, adopted correct principles and wrote bad poetry.","In a logically perfect language, there will be one word and no more for every simple object, and everything that is not simple will be expressed by a combination of words, by a combination derived, of course, from the words for the simple things that enter in, one word for each simple component.","We shall say that we have acquaintance with anything of which we are directly aware, without the intermediary of any process of inference of any knowledge of truths.","In astronomy, the law of gravitation is plainly better worth knowing than the position of a particular planet on a particular night, or even on every night throughout a year. There are in the law a splendour and simplicity and sense of mastery which illuminate a mass of otherwise uninteresting details. But in history the matter is far otherwise. Historical facts, many of them, have an intrinsic value, a profound interest on their own account, which makes them worthy of study, quite apart from any possibility of linking them together by means of causal laws.","Whatever we know without inference is mental.","Pure mathematics consists entirely of assertions to the effect that, if such and such a proposition is true of anything, then suchand such another proposition is true of that thing.... Thus mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.","The fundamental principle in the analysis of propositions containing descriptions is this: Every proposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of constituents with which we are acquainted.","Man is a rational animal\u2014so at least I have been told. \u2026 Aristotle, so far as I know, was the first man to proclaim explicitly that man is a rational animal. His reason for this view was \u2026 that some people can do sums. \u2026 It is in virtue of the intellect that man is a rational animal. The intellect is shown in various ways, but most emphatically by mastery of arithmetic. The Greek system of numerals was very bad, so that the multiplication table was quite difficult, and complicated calculations could only be made by very clever people.","Calculating machines do sums better than even the cleverest people\u2026 As arithmetic has grown easier, it has come to be less respected.","My doctor said to me afterwards, \'When you were ill you behaved like a true philosopher. Every time you came to yourself you made a joke.\' I never had a compliment that pleased me more.","True happiness for human beings is possible only to those who develop their godlike potentialities to the utmost.","Skilled work, of no matter what kind, is only done well by those who take a certain pleasure in it, quite apart from its utility, either to themselves in earning a living, or to the world through its outcome.","Morally, a philosopher who uses his professional competence for anything except a disinterested search for truth is guilty of a kind of treachery.","It is in our hearts that evil lies, and it is from our hearts that it must be plucked out.","Man can be scientifically manipulated.","So long as there is death there will be sorrow, and so long as there is sorrow it can be no part of the duty of human beings to increase its amount, in spite of the fact that a few rare spirits know how to transmute it.","The thing that I should wish to obtain from money would be leisure with security.","As a lover of truth, the national propaganda of all the belligerent nations sickened me. As a lover of civilization, the return to barbarism appalled me.","Unfortunately, however, power is sweet, and the man who in the beginning seeks power merely in order to have scope for his benevolence is likely, before long, to love the power for its own sake.","With subjectivity in philosophy, anarchism in politics goes hand in hand. Already during Luther\'s lifetime, unwelcome and unacknowledged disciples had developed the doctrine of Anabaptism, which for a time dominated the city of Munster. The Anabaptists repudiated all law since they held that good men will be guided at every moment by the Holy Spirit, who can not be bound by formulas. From this premise they arrive at communism and sexual promiscuity; they were therefore exterminated after a heroic resistance.","Through the greatness of the universe, which philosophy contemplates, the mind also is rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe which constitutes its highest good.","The reason is, and by rights ought to be, slave to the emotions.","A generation educated in fearless freedom will have wider and bolder hopes than are possible to us","The psychology of adultery has been falsified by conventional morals, which assume, in monogamous countries, that attraction to one person cannot coexist with affection for another. Everybody knows that this is untrue.","It is not known why the Lord made the human body as he did, since one might suppose that omnipotence could have made it such as would not have shocked the nice people.","If the West can claim superiority in anything, it is . . . in science and scientific technique.","If we compare Europe with other continents, it is marked out as [another] persecuting continent.","In a Balkan country, not so many years ago, a party which had been beaten by a narrow margin in a general election retrieved its fortunes by shooting a sufficient number of the representatives of the other side to give it a majority. . . . Cromwell and Robespierre . . . acted likewise.","In detective stories . . . I alternately identify myself with the murderer and the huntsman-detective, but . . . there are those to which this vicarious outlet is too mild.","[Industrialism\'s soon diminishing] capacity to supply human needs could be prevented if men exercised any restraint or foresight in their present frenzied exploitation.","In mass cruelty, the expulsions of Germans ordered by the Russians fall not very far short of the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis.","In the great depression, things could only be set right by causing the idle plant to work again . . . Roosevelt . . . spent billions of public money and created a huge public debt, but by so doing he revived production and brought his country out of the depression. Businessmen, who in spite of such a sharp lesson continued to believe in old-fashioned economics, were infinitely shocked, and although Roosevelt saved them from ruin, they continued to curse him and to speak of him as \'the madman in the White House.\' . . . [It\'s one more] striking example of inability to learn from experience.","In the ordinary business of life punctuality is . . . necessary.","It is because modern education is so seldom inspired by a great hope that it so seldom achieves great results.","It was the duty of wives to submit to husbands, not of husbands to submit to wives. . . men have stronger muscles than women.","Look at me. Look at me is one of the fundamental desires of human heart.","Love and knowledge led upwards to the heavens.","I can\'t tell whether I am living in a dream or a nightmare.","Love is a slippery eel that bites like hell","Those whose lives are fruitful to themselves, to their friends, or to the world are inspired by hope and sustained by joy: they see in imagination the things that might be and the way in which they are to be brought into existence.","Always remember that true happiness is not in getting what you want, but wanting what you already have. He who dies with the most toys is still dead. What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the will to find out, which is the exact opposite.","The purpose of education is to teach a defense against eloquence.","Broadly speaking, Protestants like to be good and have invented theology in order to keep themselves so, whereas Catholics like to be bad and have invented theology in order to keep their neighbors good. Hence, the social character of Catholicism and the individual character of Protestantism.","Humanistic ethics is based on the principle that only humans themselves can determine the criterion for virtue and not an authority transcending us.","The taboo against nakedness is an obstacle to a decent attitude on the subject of sex.","In a democracy it is necessary that people should learn to endure having their sentiments outraged.","Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom.","A life which goes excessively against natural impulse is... likely to involve effects of strain that may be quite as bad as indulgence in forbidden impulses would have been. People who live a life which is unnatural beyond a point are likely to be filled with envy, malice and uncharitableness.","Every sane and sensible and quiet thing we do is absolutely ignored by the press.","One of the most painful circumstances of recent advances in science is that each one makes us know less than we thought we did","Even if it is indifferent to human desires, as it seems to be; if human life is a passing episode, hardly noticeable in the vastness of cosmic processes; if there is no superhuman purpose, and no hope of ultimate salvation, it is better to know and acknowledge this truth than to endeavor, in futile self-assertion, to order the universe to be what we find comfortable.","It is obviously possible that what we call waking life may only be an unusual and persistent nightmare.","The time has come, or is about to come, when only large-scale civil disobedience, which should be nonviolent, can save the populations from the universal death which their governments are preparing for them.","Punctuality is a quality the need of which is bound up with social co-operation.","The Axiom of Choice is necessary to select a set from an infinite number of socks, but not an infinite number of shoes.","Experience has taught me a technique for dealing with such people [...] I counter the devotees of the Great Pyramid by adoration of the Sphinx; and the devotee of nuts by pointing out that hazelnuts and walnuts are as deleterious as other foods and only Brazil nuts should be tolerated. But when I was younger I had not yet acquired this technique, with the result that my contacts with cranks were sometimes alarming.","The practice of inhibiting impulses, which is to a great extent necessary to civilized life, makes mistakes easier, by preventing experience of the actions to which a desire would otherwise lead, and by often causing the inhibited impulses themselves to be unnoticed or quickly forgotten.","The evolution of our spirit is blazed on the dark background of eternity by our individual wakes. Every person can, if he/she wishes, leave a more or less brilliant wake behind them.","Boredom is... a vital problem for the moralist, since half the sins of mankind are caused by the fear of it.","The degree of one\'s emotions varies inversely with one\'s knowledge of the facts  - the less you know the hotter you get.","The place of the father in the modern suburban family is a very small one, particularly if he plays golf.","Mathematics takes us into the region of absolute necessity, to which not only the actual word, but every possible word, must conform.","Indignation is a submission of our thoughts, but not of our desires.","I like mathematics because it is not human and has nothing particular to do with this planet or with the whole accidental universe - because, like Spinoza\'s God, it won\'t love us in return.","Aristotle could have avoided the mistake of thinking that women have fewer teeth than men, by the simple device of asking Mrs. Aristotle to keep her mouth open while he counted.","Every philosophical problem, when it is subjected to the necessary analysis and justification, is found either to be not really philosophical at all, or else to be, in the sense in which we are using the word, logical.","Almost everything that distinguishes the modern world from earlier centuries is attributable to science, which achieved its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century.","Against my will, in the course of my travels, the belief that everything worth knowing was known at Cambridge gradually wore off. In this respect my travels were very useful to me.","No; we have been as usual asking the wrong question. It does not matter a hoot what the mockingbird on the chimney is singing. The real and proper question is: Why is it beautiful?","Machines are worshipped because they are beautiful and valued because they confer power; they are hated because they are hideous and loathed because they impose slavery.","In the revolt against idealism, the ambiguities of the word experience have been perceived, with the result that realists have more and more avoided the word.","Dogmatism is the greatest of mental obstacles to human happiness.","From that awful encounter of the soul with the outer world, enunciation, wisdom, and charity are born; and with their birth a new life begins. To take into the inmost shrine of the soul the irresistible forces whose puppets we seem to be - Death and change, the irrevocableness of the past, and the powerlessness of Man before the blind hurry of the universe from vanity to vanity - to feel these things and know them is to conquer them.","I think that there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached.","War grows out of ordinary human nature.","All serious innovation is only rendered possible by some accident enabling unpopular persons to survive.","Of course not. After all, I may be wrong.","In regard to the past, where contemplation is not obscured by desire and the need for action, we see, more clearly than in the lives about us, the value for good and evil, of the aims men have pursued and the means they have adopted. It is good, from time to time, to view the present as already past, and to examine what elements it contains that will add to the world\'s store of permanent possessions, that will live and give life when we and all our generation have perished.","At all times, except when a monarch could enforce his will, war has been facilitated by the fact that vigorous males, confident of victory, enjoyed it, while their females admired them for their prowess.","War...seems a mere madness, a collective insanity.","I have come to realize that an early symptom of approaching mental illness is the belief that one\'s work is terribly important. If you consider your work very important you should take a day off.","Envy is the basis of democracy.","Uncertainty in the pressure of vivid hopes and fears is painful, but must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting fairy tales.","There will still be things that machines cannot do. They will not produce great art or great literature or great philosophy; they will not be able to discover the secret springs of happiness in the human heart; they will know nothing of love and friendship.","Bad philosophers may have a certain influence; good philosophers, never.","Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, the chief glory of man.","The conception of the necessary unit of all that is resolves itself into the poverty of the imagination, and a freer logic emancipates us from the straitwaistcoated benevolent institution, which idealism palms off as the totality of being.","Love is a little haven of refuge from the world.","To expect a personality to survive the disintegration of the brain is like expecting a cricket club to survive when all of its members are dead.","Ever since men became capable of free speculation, their actions, in innumerable important respects, have depended upon their theories as to the world and human life, as to what is good and what is evil. This is true in the present day as at any former time. To understand an age or a nation, we must understand its philosophy, and to understand its philosophy we must ourselves be in some degree philosophers. There is here a reciprocal causation: the circumstances of men s lives do much to determine their philosophy, but, conversely, their philosophy does much to determine their circumstances.","Modern definitions of truth, such as those as pragmatism and instrumentalism, which are practical rather than contemplative, are inspired by industrialisation as opposed to aristocracy.","Science is no substitute for virtue; the heart is as necessary for a good life as the head.","I think periods of browsing during which no occupation is imposed from without are important in youth because they give time for the formation of these apparently fugitive but really vital impressions.","There was, I think, never any reason to believe in any innate superiority of the male, except his superior muscle.","It appeared that after first contemplating a book on some subject, and after giving serious preliminary attention to it, I needed a period of subconscious incubation which could not be hurried and was if anything impeded by deliberate thinking.... Having, by a time of very intense concentration, planted the problem in my subconsciousness, it would germinate underground until, suddenly, the solution emerged with a blinding clarity, so that it only remained to write down what happened as if in a revelation.","To modern educated people, it seems obvious that matters of fact are to be ascertained by observation, not by consulting ancient authorities. But this is an entirely modern conception, which hardly existed before the seventeenth century.","All who are not lunatics are agreed about certain things : That it is better to be alive than dead, better to be adequately fed than starved, better to be free than a slave","A smell of petroleum prevails throughout.","Measures of sterilization should, in my opinion, be very definitely confined to persons who are mentally defective","All that passes for knowledge can be arranged in a hierarchy of degrees of certainty, with arithmetic and the facts of perception at the top.","In adolescence, I hated life and was continually on the verge of suicide, from which, however, I was restrained by the desire to know more mathematics. Now, on the contrary, I enjoy life; I might almost say that with every year that passes I enjoy it more.","The atomic bomb embodies the results of a combination genius and patience as remarkable as any in the history of mankind.","Some `advanced thinkers\' are of the opinion that anyone who differs from the conventional opinion must be in the right. This is a delusion; if it were not, truth would be easier to come by than it is.","The argument against the persecution of opinion does not depend upon what the excuse for persecution may be. The argument is that we none of us know all truth, that the discovery of new truth is promoted by free discussion and rendered very difficult by suppression.","Power, like vanity, is insatiable. Nothing short of omnipotence could satisfy it completely.","Written words differ from spoken words in being material structures. A spoken word is a process in the physical world, having an essential time-order; a written word is a series of pieces of matter, having an essential space-order.","A fanatical belief in democracy makes democratic institutions impossible.","Mystery is delightful, but unscientific, since it depends upon ignorance.","Facts have to be discovered by observation, not by reasoning","A life devoted to science is therefore a happy life, and its happiness is derived from the very best sources that are open to dwellers on this troubled and passionate planet.","The best authorities are unanimous in saying that a war with H-bombs might possibly put an end to the human race. It is feared that if many H-bombs are used there will be universal death, sudden only for a minority, but for the majority a slow torture of disease and disintegration.","My own view on religion is . . . It helped in early days to fix the calendar, and . . . to chronicle eclipses . . . These two services I am prepared to acknowledge.","Neither the Church nor modern public opinion condemns petting, provided it stops short at a certain point.","People who are vigorous and brutal often find war enjoyable.","When anaesthetics were invented they were thought to be wicked as being an attempt to thwart God\'s will. Insanity was thought to be due to diabolic possession, and it was believed that demons inhabiting a madman could be driven out by inflicting pain upon him, and so making them uncomfortable. In pursuit of this opinion, lunatics were treated for years on end with systematic and conscientious brutality.","When I was a child . . . Only virtue was prized, virtue at the expense of intellect, health, happiness, and every mundane good.","The human race may well become extinct before the end of the century.","Plato has dramatic strength ... but is quite unaware of the strength of the argument against his position ... and allows himself to be grossly unfair in arguing against it.","In spreading his ideas, Plato was willing to employ emotional appeals, state propaganda, and the use of force.","Aristotle\'s metaphysics, roughly speaking, may be described as Plato diluted by common sense. He is difficult because Plato and common sense do not mix easily.","Is the set of all sets which are not members of themselves a member of itself?","Patriotism which has the quality of intoxication is a danger not only to its native land but to the world, and \\"My country never wrong\\" is an even more dangerous maxim than \\"My country, right or wrong.\\"","To be out of harmony with one\'s surroundings is of course a misfortune, but it is not always a misfortune to be avoided at all costs. Where the environment is stupid or prejudiced or cruel, it is a sign of merit to be out of harmony with it.","If life is to be fully human it must serve some end which seems, in some sense, outside human life, some end which is impersonal and above mankind, such as God or truth or beauty. Those who best promote life do not have life for their purpose. They aim rather at what seems like a gradual incarnation, a bringing into our human existence of something eternal, something that appears to imagination to live in a heaven remote from strife and failure and the devouring jaws of Time.","The triumph of science has been mainly due to its practical utility, and there has been an attempt to divorce this aspect from that of theory, thus making science more and more a technique, and less and less a doctrine as to the nature of the world. The penetration of this point of view to philosophers is very recent.","It is false to suggest that men must turn away from his desires in the interest of a higher duty. Men only responds to duty if he desires to do so. To understand men, you must understand their desires and the relative strength of those desires.","As I grew up I became increasingly interested in philosophy, or which [his family] profoundly disapproved. Everytime the subject came up they repeated with unfailing regularity, \\"What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind.\\" After some fifty or sixty repititions, this remark ceased to amuse me.","I used, when I was younger, to take my holidays walking. I would cover 25 miles a day, and when the evening came I had no need of anything to keep me from boredom, since the delight of sitting amply sufficed.","Meantime, the world in which we exist has other aims. But it will pass away, burnt up in the fire  of its own hot passions; and from its ashes will spring a new and younger world, full of fresh  hope, woth the light of morning in its eyes.","They must often change, who would be constant in happiness or wisdom. Those who continually search for happiness will never find it. Happiness is made, not found.  To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.","When all experts agree, you need to watch out.","A man of Seville is shaved by the Barber of Seville if and only if the man does not shave himself. Does the barber shave himself?","The tendency of our perceptions is to emphasise increasingly the objective elements in an impression, unless we have some special reason, as artists have, for doing the opposite.","A physicist looks for causes; that does not necessarily imply that there are causes everywhere. A man may look for gold without assuming that there is gold everywhere; if he finds gold, well and good, if he doesn\'t he\'s had bad luck. The same is true when the physicists look for causes.","When I was 4 years old ... I dreamt that I\'d been eaten by a wolf, and to my great surprise I was in the wolf\'s stomach and not in heaven.","The above proposition is occasionally useful.","It must not be supposed that the subjective elements are any less \'real\' than the objective elements; they are only less important... because they do not point to anything beyond ourselves.","One who believes, as I do, that the free intellect is the chief engine of human progress, cannot but be fundamentally opposed to Bolshevism, as much as to the Church of Rome.","I greatly doubt whether the men who become pirate chiefs are those who are filled with retrospective terror of their fathers, or whether Napoleon , at Austerlitz, really felt that he was getting even with Madame M\xe8re. I know nothing of the mother of Attila , but I rather suspect that she spoilt the little darling, who subsequently found the world irritating because it sometimes resisted his whims.","When I found myself regarded as respectable, I began to wonder what sins I had committed. I must be very wicked, I thought. I began to engage in the most uncomfortable introspection.","You, your families, your friends and your countries are to be exterminated by the common decision of a few brutal but powerful men. To please these men, all the private affections, all the public hopes, all that has been achieved in art, and knowledge and thought and all that might be achieved hereafter is to be wiped out forever. Our ruined lifeless planet will continue for countless ages to circle aimlessly round the sun unredeemed by the joys and loves, the occasional wisdom and the power to create beauty which have given value to human life.","No man who believes that all is for the best in this suffering world can keep his ethical values unimpaired, since he is always having to find excuses for pain and misery.","The camera is as subjective as we are.","Socrates was the chief saint of the Stoics throughout their history ; his attitude at the time of his trial, his refusal to escape, his calmness in the face of death , and his contention that the perpetrator of injustice injures himself more than his victim, all fitted in perfectly with Stoic teaching. So did his indifference to heat and cold, his plainness in matters of food and dress, and his complete independence of all bodily comforts.","The atomists , unlike Socrates , Plato , and Aristotle , sought to explain the world without introducing the notion of purpose or final cause.","[One] must look into hell before one has any right to speak of heaven.","Education, and the life of the mind generally, is a matter in which individual initiative is the chief thing needed; the function of the state should begin and end with insistence on some kind of education, and, if possible, a kind which promotes mental individualism, not a kind which happens to conform to the prejudices of government officials.","My own view on religion is that of Lucretius. I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race.","Every increase in knowledge requires an increase in wisdom","I feel as if one would only discover on one\'s death bed what one ought to have lived for","The rules of logic are to mathematics what those of structure are to architecture.","People are said to believe in God, or to disbelieve in Adam and Eve. But in such cases what is believed or disbelieved is that there is an entity answering a certain description. This, which can be believed or disbelieved is quite different from the actual entity (if any) which does answer the description. Thus the matter of belief is, in all cases, different in kind from the matter of sensation or presentation, and error is in no way analogous to hallucination. A hallucination is a fact, not an error; what is erroneous is a judgment based upon it.","The saviors of the world, society\'s last hope.","Cynicism such as one finds very frequently among the most highly educated young men and women of the West, results from the combination of comfort and powerlessness.","Beggars do not envy millionaires, though of course they will envy other beggars who are more successful.","One of the troubles about vanity is that it grows with what it feeds on. The more you are talked about, the more you will wish to be talked about.","Civilized life has altogether grown too tame, and, if it is to be stable, it must provide a harmless outlets for the impulses which our remote ancestors satisfied in hunting.","In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge the governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.","I am compelled to fear that science will be used to promote the power of dominant groups rather than to make men happy.","Physics, owing to the simplicity of its subject matter, has reached a higher state of development than any other science.","A priori Logical propositions are such as can be known a priori without study of the actual world.","The pure mathematician, like the musician, is a free creator of his world of ordered beauty.","It is in the nature of imperialism that citizens of the imperial power are always among the last to know-or care-about circumstances in the colonies.","Boys and young men acquire readily the moral sentiments of their social milieu, whatever these sentiments may be.","The solution of the difficulties which formerly surrounded the mathematical infinite is probably the greatest achievement of which our age has to boast.","Whether science-and indeed civilization in general-can long survive depends upon psychology, that is to say, it depends upon what human beings desire.","We believe, first and foremost, what makes us feel that we are fine fellows.","It is only theory that makes men completely incautious.","One\'s work is never so bad as it appears on bad days, nor so good as it appears on good days.","... the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be.","An individual human existence should be like a river","Religion and Science are two aspects of social life, of which the former has been important as far back as we know anything of man","With civilized men..., it is, I think, chiefly love of excitement which makes the populace applaud when war breaks out; the emotion is exactly the same as at a football match, although the results are sometimes somewhat more serious.","Undoubtedly the desire for food has been and still is one of the main causes of political events.","Philosophers, for the most part, are constitutionally timid, and dislike the unexpected. Few of them would be genuinely happy as pirates or burglars. Accordingly they invent systems which make the future calculable, at least in its main outlines.","Nine-tenths of the appeal of pornography is due to the indecent feelings concerning sex which moralists inculcate in the young; the other tenth is physiological, and will occur in one way or another whatever the state of the law may be.","It is impossible to read in America, except on a train, because of the telephone. Everyone has a telephone, and it rings all day and most of the night.","The military superiority of Europe to Asia is not an eternal law of nature, as we are tempted to think, and our superiority in civilization is a mere delusion.","It has become a commonplace that aggressiveness also often has its roots in fear.  I am inclined to think that this theory has been pushed too far.  [...]  The type of aggressiveness that is the outcome of timidity is not, I think, that which inspires great leaders; the great leaders, I should say, have an exceptional self-confidence which is not only on the surface, but penetrates deep into the subconscious.","The most essential characteristic of scientific technique is that it proceeds from experiment, not from tradition.","The great majority of men and women, in ordinary times, pass through life without ever contemplating or criticising, as a whole, either their own conditions or those of the world at large.","Inferences of Science and Common Sense differ from those of deductive logic and mathematics in a very important respect, namely, when the premises are true and the reasoning correct, the conclusion is only probable.","But I simply can\'t stand a view limited to this earth, I feel life is so small unless it has windows into other worlds...I like mathematics largely because it is not human.","No other organization rouses anything like the loyalty aroused by the national State. And the chief activity of the State is preparation for large-scale homicide.","Neither acquiescence in skepticism nor acquiescence in dogma is what education should produce.","One of the chief obstacles to intelligence is credulity, and credulity could be enormously diminished by instructions as to the prevalent forms of mendacity.","When we perceive any object of a familiar kind, much of what appears subjectively to be immediately given is really derived from past experience.","Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.","To create a healthy philosophy you should renounce metaphysics but be a good mathematician.","A proverb is one man\'s wit and all men\'s wisdom.","The qualities most needed are charity and tolerance, not some form of fanatical faith such as is offered to us by the various rampant isms","Throughout the long period of religious doubt, I had been rendered very unhappy by the gradual loss of belief, but when the process was completed, I found to my surprise that I was quite glad to be done with the whole subject.","There is... in our day, a powerful antidote to nonsense, which hardly existed in earlier times - I mean science. Science cannot be ignored or rejected, because it is bound up with modern technique; it is essential alike to prosperity in peace and to victory in war. That is, perhaps from an intellectual point of view, the most hopeful feature of our age, and the one which makes it most likely that we shall escape complete submersion in some new or old superstition.","In the first place a philosophical proposition must be general. It must not deal specially with things on the surface of the earth, or within the solar system, or with any other portion of space and time. . . . This brings us to a second characteristic of philosophical propositions, namely that they must be a priori. A philosophical proposition must be such as can neither be proved nor disproved by empirical evidence. . . . Philosophy, if what has been said is correct, becomes indistinguishable from logic as that word has now come to be used.","If a philosophy is to bring happiness it should be inspired by kindly feelings. Marx pretended that he wanted the happiness of the proletariat; what he really wanted was the unhappiness of the bourgeois.","He will see himself and life and the world as truly as our human limitations will permit; realizing the brevity and minuteness of human life, he will realize also that in individual minds is concentrated whatever of value the known universe contains. And he will see that the man whose mind mirrors the world becomes in a sense as great as the world. In emancipation from the fears that beset the slave of circumstance he will experience a profound joy, and through all the vicissitudes of his outward life he will remain in the depths of his being a happy man.","To a modern mind, it is difficult to feel enthusiastic about a virtuous life if nothing is going to be achieved by it.","Emphatic and reiterated assertion, especially during childhood, produces in most people a belief so firm as to have a hold even over the unconscious.","For over two thousand years it has been the custom among earnest moralists to decry happiness as something degraded and unworthy","There is little of the true philosophic spirit in Aquinas. He does not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument may lead.","You may, if you are an old-fashioned schoolmaster, wish to consider yourself full of universal benevolence and at the same time derive great pleasure from caning boys.

A great deal of work is sedentary, and most manual work exercises only a few specialized muscles.","Even in civilized mankind faint traces of monogamous instinct can be perceived.","The essence of life is doing things for their own sakes.","Philosophy seems to me on the whole a rather hopeless business.","Science tells us what we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive to many things of great importance.","The pleasure of work is open to anyone who can develop some specialised skill, provided that he can get satisfaction from the exercise of his skill without demanding universal applause.","Law in origin was merely a codification of the power of dominant groups, and did not aim at anything that to a modern man would appear to be justice","Do not feel certain of anything.","Literature is inexhaustible, with every book a homage to infinity","Every housemaid expects at least once a week as much excitement as would have lasted a Jane Austen heroine throughout a whole novel.","In all the creative work that I have done, what has come first is a problem, a puzzle involving discomfort.","Frege has the merit of ... finding a third assertion by recognising the world of logic which is neither mental nor physical.","The main thing needed to make men happy is intelligence.","Education ought to foster the wish for truth, not the conviction that some particular creed is the truth.","I did not, however, commit suicide, because I wished to know more of mathematics.","Even in the most purely logical realms, it is insight that first arrives at what is new.","Marx\'s father became a Christian when Marx was a little boy, and some, at least, of the dogmas he must have then accepted seem to have born fruit in his son\'s psychology.","The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.","To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already 3-parts dead.","Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.","Our great democracies still tend to think that a stupid man is more likely to be honest than a clever man, and our politicians take advantage of this prejudice by pretending to be even more stupid than nature made them.","One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one\u2019s work is terribly important.","The hardest thing to learn in life is which bridge to cross and which to burn.","To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can still do for those who study it.","Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth -- more than ruin, more even than death. Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habits; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid ... Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man.","My desire and wish is that the things I start with should be so obvious that you wonder why I spend my time stating them. This is what I aim at because the point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.","It is the preoccupation with possessions, more than anything else, that prevents us from living freely and nobly.","That is the idea -- that we should all be wicked if we did not hold to the Christian religion. It seems to me that the people who have held to it have been for the most part extremely wicked. You find this curious fact, that the more intense has been the religion of any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs. In the so-called ages of faith, when men really did believe the Christian religion in all its completeness, there was the Inquisition, with all its tortures; there were millions of unfortunate women burned as witches; and there was every kind of cruelty practiced upon all sorts of people in the name of religion.You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in humane feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races, or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the world. I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.You may think that I am going too far when I say that that is still so. I do not think that I am. Take one fact. You will bear with me if I mention it. It is not a pleasant fact, but the churches compel one to mention facts that are not pleasant. Supposing that in this world that we live in today an inexperienced girl is married to a syphilitic man; in that case the Catholic Church says, \'This is an indissoluble sacrament. You must endure celibacy or stay together. And if you stay together, you must not use birth control to prevent the birth of syphilitic children.\' Nobody whose natural sympathies have not been warped by dogma, or whose moral nature was not absolutely dead to all sense of suffering, could maintain that it is right and proper that that state of things should continue.That is only an example. There are a great many ways in which, at the present moment, the church, by its insistence upon what it chooses to call morality, inflicts upon all sorts of people undeserved and unnecessary suffering. And of course, as we know, it is in its major part an opponent still of progress and improvement in all the ways that diminish suffering in the world, because it has chosen to label as morality a certain narrow set of rules of conduct which have nothing to do with human happiness; and when you say that this or that ought to be done because it would make for human happiness, they think that has nothing to do with the matter at all. \'What has human happiness to do with morals? The object of morals is not to make people happy.","No one gossips about other people\u2019s secret virtues.","One should as a rule respect public opinion in so far as is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny, and is likely to interfere with happiness in all kinds of ways.","If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.","The secret of happiness is to face the fact that the world is horrible, horrible, horrible.","Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair. I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness--that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what--at last--I have found.With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved. Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer. This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.","I believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive. I am not young and I love life. But I should scorn to shiver with terror at the thought of annihilation. Happiness is nonetheless true happiness because it must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value because they are not everlasting. Many a man has borne himself proudly on the scaffold; surely the same pride should teach us to think truly about man\'s place in the world. Even if the open windows of science at first make us shiver after the cosy indoor warmth of traditional humanizing myths, in the end the fresh air brings vigour, and the great spaces have a splendour of their own.","Patriots always talk of dying for their country but never of killing for their country.","[T]he infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists. That is why they invented Hell.","There is something feeble and a little contemptible about a man who cannot face the perils of life without the help of comfortable myths. Almost inevitably some part of him is aware that they are myths and that he believes them only because they are comforting. But he dare not face this thought! Moreover, since he is aware, however dimly, that his opinions are not rational, he becomes furious when they are disputed.","So far as I can remember there is not one word in the Gospels in praise of intelligence.","If there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others, we could have paradise in a few years.","The secret of happiness is this: let your interest be as wide as possible and let your reactions to the things and persons who interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile.","The good life is inspired by love and guided by knowledge","\u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u063a\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0634\u062f\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062b\u0642\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u0634\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0642\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627\u060c \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0641\u062a\u0645\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0643\u0648\u0643","Science is what you know, philosophy is what you don\'t know","Sin is geographical.","Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty\u2014a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.","We want to stand upon our own feet and look fair and square at the world - its good facts, its bad facts, its beauties, and its ugliness; see the world as it is and not be afraid of it. Conquer the world by intelligence and not merely by being slavishly subdued by the terror that comes from it. The whole conception of God is a conception derived from the ancient Oriental despotisms. It is a conception quite unworthy of free men. When you hear people in church debasing themselves and saying that they are miserable sinners, and all the rest of it, it seems contemptible and not worthy of self-respecting human beings. We ought to stand up and look the world frankly in the face. We ought to make the best we can of the world, and if it is not so good as we wish, after all it will still be better than what these others have made of it in all these ages. A good world needs knowledge, kindliness, and courage; it does not need a regretful hankering after the past or a fettering of the free intelligence by words uttered long ago by ignorant men. It needs a fearless outlook and free intelligence. It needs hope for the future, not looking back all the time toward a past that is dead, which we trust will be far surpassed by the future that our intelligence can create.","Love can flourish only as long as it is free and spontaneous; it tends to be killed by the thought of duty. To say that it is your duty to love so-and-so is the surest way to cause you to hate him of her.","Religion is based primarily upon fear. It is partly the terror of the unknown and partly as the wish to feel that you have a kind of elder brother who will stand by you in all your troubles and disputes. Fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand. It is because fear is at the basis of those two things. In this world we can now begin a little to understand things, and a little to master them by help of science, which has forced its way step by step against the opposition of all the old precepts. Science can help us to get over this craven fear in which mankind has lived for so many generations. Science can teach us, and I think our own hearts can teach us, no longer to look around for imaginary supports, no longer to invent allies in the sky, but rather to look to our own efforts here below to make this world a fit place to live in, instead of the place that the churches in all these centuries have made it.","Almost everything that distinguishes the modern world from earlier centuries is attibutable to science, which achieved its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century.","A happy life must be to a great extent a quiet life, for it is only in an atmosphere of quiet that true joy can live.","Patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons","I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.","There was a footpath leading across fields to New Southgate, and I used to go there alone to watch the sunset and contemplate suicide. I did not, however, commit suicide, because I wished to know more of mathematics.","To all the talented young men who wander about feeling that there is nothing in the world for them to do, I should say: \'Give up trying to write, and, instead, try not to write. Go out into the world; become a pirate, a king in Borneo, a labourer in Soviet Russia; give yourself an existence in which the satisfaction of elementary physical needs will occupy almost all your energies.\' I do not recommend this course of action to everyone, but only to those who suffer from the disease which Mr Krutch diagnoses. I believe that, after some years of such an existence, the ex-intellectual will fin that in spite of is efforts he can no longer refrain from writing, and when this time comes his writing will not seem to him futile.","The Ten Commandments that, as a teacher, I should wish to promulgate, might be set forth as follows:1- Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.2- Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.3- Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.4- When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.5- Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.6- Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.7- Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.8- Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.9- Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.10- Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool\u2019s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.","Boredom is therefore a vital problem for the moralist, since at least half the sins of mankind are caused by the fear of it.","The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish form our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instill faith in times of despair.","When you come to look into this argument from design, it is a most astonishing thing that people can believe that this world, with all the things that are in it, with all its defects, should be the best that omnipotence and omniscience have been able to produce in millions of years. I really cannot believe it. Do you think that, if you were granted omnipotence and omniscience and millions of years in which to perfect your world, you could produce nothing better than the Ku Klux Klan or the Fascists? Moreover, if you accept the ordinary laws of science, you have to suppose that human life and life in general on this planet will die out in due course: it is a stage in the decay of the solar system; at a certain stage of decay you get the sort of conditions of temperature and so forth which are suitable to protoplasm, and there is life for a short time in the life of the whole solar system. You see in the moon the sort of thing to which the earth is tending -- something dead, cold, and lifeless.","That Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man\u2019s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the d\xe9bris of a universe in ruins\u2014all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul\u2019s habitation henceforth be safely built.","Having made the decision, do not revise it unless some new fact comes to your knowledge. Nothing is so exhausting as indecision, and nothing is so futile.","The secret of happiness is very simply this: let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile","\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u062f\u0627\u0641\u0639\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0627: \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0639 \u0628\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0647\u064a \u0628\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u062a\u0647.","Even if all the experts agree, they may well be mistaken.","I have been accused of a habit of changing my opinions. I am not myself in any degree ashamed of having changed my opinions. What physicist who was already active in 1900 would dream of boasting that his opinions had not changed during the last half century? In science men change their opinions when new knowledge becomes available; but philosophy in the minds of many is assimilated rather to theology than to science. The kind of philosophy that I value and have endeavoured to pursue is scientific, in the sense that there is some definite knowledge to be obtained and that new discoveries can make the admission of former error inevitable to any candid mind. For what I have said, whether early or late, I do not claim the kind of truth which theologians claim for their creeds. I claim only, at best, that the opinion expressed was a sensible one to hold at the time when it was expressed. I should be much surprised if subsequent research did not show that it needed to be modified. I hope, therefore, that whoever uses this dictionary will not suppose the remarks which it quotes to be intended as pontifical pronouncements, but only as the best I could do at the time towards the promotion of clear and accurate thinking. Clarity, above all, has been my aim.","Envy consists in seeing things never in themselves, but only in their relations. If you desire glory, you may envy Napoleon, but Napoleon envied Caesar, Caesar envied Alexander, and Alexander, I daresay, envied Hercules, who never existed.","The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way.","Love is wise,Hatred is foolish","Most people would rather die than think and many of them do!","Men are born ignorant, not stupid; they are made stupid by education.","Love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives.","Extreme hopes are born from extreme misery.","Sometimes the hardest thing in life is to know which bridge to cross and which to burn","I should like to say two things, one intellectual and one moral. The intellectual thing I should want to say is this: When you are studying any matter, or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe, or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed. But look only, and solely, at what are the facts. That is the intellectual thing that I should wish to say. The moral thing I should wish to say\u2026I should say love is wise, hatred is foolish. In this world which is getting more closely and closely interconnected we have to learn to tolerate each other, we have to learn to put up with the fact that some people say things that we don\'t like. We can only live together in that way and if we are to live together and not die together we must learn a kind of charity and a kind of tolerance which is absolutely vital to the continuation of human life on this planet.","I\u2019ve made an odd discovery.

Yet when I talk with my gardener, I\u2019m convinced of the opposite.","If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day, there would be enough for everybody and no unemployment -- assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use so much leisure. In America men often work long hours even when they are well off; such men, naturally, are indignant at the idea of leisure for wage-earners, except as the grim punishment of unemployment; in fact, they dislike leisure even for their sons.","The centre of me is always and eternally in terrible pain ...

Neither the ancient nor the medieval solution was satisfactory \u2013 the one because it could not be idealized, the other because it could not be actualized. The modern world, at present, seems to be moving towards a solution like that of antiquity: a social order imposed by force, representing the will of the powerful rather than the hopes of the common men. The problem of a durable and satisfactory social order can only be solved by combining the solidarity of the Roman Empire with the idealism of St. Augustine\u2019s City of God. To achieve this a new philosophy will be needed","What I do maintain is that success can only be one ingredient in happiness, and is too dearly purchased if all the other ingredients have been sacrificed to obtain it.","\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u064a\u062c\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0643\u0648\u062f\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0648\u0636\u0649.","Science tells us what we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much we cannot know, we become insensitive to many things of great importance.","what is work? Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth\'s surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first one is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid.","Pure mathematics consists entirely of assertions to the effect that, if such and such a proposition is true of anything, then such and such another proposition is true of that thing. It is essential not to discuss whether the first proposition is really true, and not to mention what the anything is, of which it is supposed to be true. [...] Thus mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true. People who have been puzzled by the beginnings of mathematics will, I hope, find comfort in this definition, and will probably agree that it is accurate.","Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intelligence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on any subject whatever. When an intelligent man expresses a view which seems to us obviously absurd, we should not attempt to prove that it is somehow true, but we should try to understand how it ever came toseemtrue. Thisexercise of historical and psychological imagination at once enlarges the scope of our thinking, and helps us to realize how foolish many of our own cherished prejudices will seem to an age which has a different temper of mind.","Here there comes a practical question which has often troubled me. Whenever I go into a foreign country or a prison or any similar place they always ask me what is my religion.I never know whether I should say \\"Agnostic\\" or whether I should say \\"Atheist\\". It is a very difficult question and I daresay that some of you have been troubled by it. As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God.On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.None of us would seriously consider the possibility that all the gods of homer really exist, and yet if you were to set to work to give a logical demonstration that Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, and the rest of them did not exist you would find it an awful job. You could not get such proof.Therefore, in regard to the Olympic gods, speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the Christian God, I should, I think, take exactly the same line.","Why is propaganda so much more successful when it stirs up hatred than when it tries to stir up friendly feeling? The reason is clearly that the human heart as modern civilisation has made it is more prone to hatred than to friendship. And it is prone to hatred because it is dissatisfied, because it feels deply, perhaps even unconsciously, that it has somehow missed the meaning of life, that perhaps others, but not we ourselves, have secured the good things which nature offers man\'s enjoyment.","Man is a rational animal.

These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair. I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness--that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what--at last--I have found.With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved. Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer. This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.","The feeling is one born of a too easy satisfaction of natural needs. The human animal, like others, is adapted to a certain amount of struggle for life, and when by means of great wealth homo sapiens can gratify all his whims without effort, the mere absence of effort from his life removes an essential ingredient of happiness. The man who acquires easily things for which he feels only a very moderate desire concludes that the attainment of desire does not bring happiness. If he is of a philosophic dispositi on, he concludes that human life is essentially wretched, since the man who has all he wants is still unhappy. He forgets that to be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.","Nevertheless, when it is your lot to have to endure something that is (or seems to you) worse than the ordinary lot of mankind, Spinoza\'s principle of thinking about the whole, or at any rate about larger matters than your own grief, is a useful one. There are even times when it is comforting to reflect that human life, with all that is contains of evil and suffering, is an infinitesimal part of the life of the universe. Such reflections may not suffice to constitute a religion, but in a painful world they are a help towards sanity and an antidote to the paralysis of utter despair. - about Spinoza","One of the causes of unhappiness among intellectuals in the present day is that so many of them, especially those whose skill is literary, find no opportunity for the independent exercise of their talents, but have to hire themselves out to rich corporations directed by Philistines, who insist upon their producing what they themselves regard as pernicious nonsense. If you were to inquire among journalists in either England or America whether they believed in the policy of the newspaper for which they worked, you would find, I believe, that only a small minority do so; the rest, for the sake of a livelihood, prostitute their skill to purposes which they believe to be harmful. Such work cannot bring any real satisfaction, and in the course of reconciling himself to the doing of it, a man has to make himself so cynical that he can no longer derive whole-hearted satisfaction from anything whatever. I cannot condemn men who undertake work of this sort, since starvation is too serious an alternative, but I think that where it is possible to do work that is satisfactory to man\u2019s constructive impulses without entirely starving, he will be well advised from the point of view of his own happiness if he chooses it in preference to work much more highly paid but not seeming to him worth doing on its own account. Without self-respect genuine happiness is scarcely possible. And the man who is ashamed of his work can hardly achieve self-respect.","I am myself a dissenter from all known religions, and I hope that every kind of religious belief will die out. I do not believe that, on the balance, religious belief has been a force for good. Although I am prepared to admit that in certain times and places it has had some good effects, I regard it as belonging to the infancy of human reason, and to a stage of development which we are now outgrowing.","The megalomaniac differs from the narcissist by the fact that he wishes to be powerful rather than charming, and seeks to be feared rather than loved. to this type belong many lunatics and most of the great men of history.","I should wish to see a world in which education aimed at mental freedom rather than at imprisoning the minds of the young in a rigid armor of dogma calculated to protect them through life against the shafts of impartial evidence.","I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by belief in the virtuousness of work, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organised diminution of work.","A good social system is not to be secured by making people unselfish, but, by making their own vital impulses fit in with other peoples.

They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness.

If we are again to have progress, we must again be dominated by hope.","Drunkenness is temporary suicide: the happiness that it brings is merely negative, a momentary cessation of unhappiness.","Love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse; it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives. There is a deep-seated fear, in most people, of the cold world and the possible cruelty of the herd; there is a longing for affection, which is often concealed by roughness, boorishness or a bullying manner in men, and by nagging and scolding in women. Passionate mutual love while it lasts puts an end to this feeling; it breaks down the hard walls of the ego, producing a new being composed of two in one.","\u0647\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0645

In spite of death, the mark and seal of the parental control, man is yet free, during his brief years, to examine, to criticize, to know, and in imagination to create.

I find that much unclear thought exists as an excuse for cruelty, and that much cruelty is prompted by superstitious beliefs.","The fundamental cause of trouble in the world today is that the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.","\u062a\u0646\u0642\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0648\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u062f\u0631\u062c\u0627\u062a \u062a\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0648\u062a \u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0648\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u062a\u0645\u064a\u0632\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0633\u0647\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u062d\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0633\u062a \u0645\u0639\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u062a\u0627\u064a\u064a\u062f \u0627\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0628\u0644 \u0628\u0648\u0635\u0641 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u062d\u0633\u0628 \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0621 \u0641\u0647\u0648 \u0648\u0642\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0647\u0629\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u062b\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u0639\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u0647\u0644 \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0647 \u0644\u0648\u0635\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0641\u062a\u0648\u062d \u0644\u0627\u064a \u0645\u062e\u0644\u0648\u0642 \u0628\u0634\u0631\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u064a\u0631 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0641\u062a\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u062c\u064a\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647","If everything has a cause, then God must have a cause.

For, as all right-thinking people were aware, lightning is sent by God to punish impiety or some other grave sin\u2014the virtuous are never struck by lightning. Therefore if God wants to strike any one, Benjamin Franklin [and his lightning-rod] ought not to defeat His design; indeed, to do so is helping criminals to escape. But God was equal to the occasion, if we are to believe the eminent Dr. Price, one of the leading divines of Boston. Lightning having been rendered ineffectual by the \'iron points invented by the sagacious Dr. Franklin,\' Massachusetts was shaken by earthquakes, which Dr. Price perceived to be due to God\'s wrath at the \'iron points.\' In a sermon on the subject he said, \'In Boston are more erected than elsewhere in New England, and Boston seems to be more dreadfully shaken. Oh! there is no getting out of the mighty hand of God.\' Apparently, however, Providence gave up all hope of curing Boston of its wickedness, for, though lightning-rods became more and more common, earthquakes in Massachusetts have remained rare.","\u0648\u0636\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0641\u0636\u064a\u0644\u0629","All that alcohol does for them is to liberate the sense of sin, which reason suppresses in saner moments.","The essence of the conception of righteousness, therefore, is to afford an outlet for sadism by cloaking cruelty as justice.","Each of us is in the world for no very long time, and within the few years of his life has to acquire whatever he is to know of this strange planet and its place in the universe.

Both private and public misfortune can only be mastered by a process in which will and intelligence interact: the part of will is to refuse to shirk the evil or accept an unreal solution, while the part of intelligence is to understand it, to find a cure if it is curable, and, if not, to make it bearable by seeing it in its relations, accepting it as unavoidable, and remembering what lies outside it in other regions, other ages, and the abysses of interstellar space","Leibniz was somewhat mean about money.

And the minority that do understand continue to be Moslems because they have redefined their morality and ethics to fit within the teachings of Islam, which are floridly lacking in morality. They therefore redefine what is good and evil in order to fit their lives into what is preached by Islam, instead of examining Islam to see if it fits within the good life.

The earth was the center of the Universe, man was the purpose of creation, his own city showed man at his best, and he himself was among the best of his own city. In such circumstances \xc6schylus or Dante could take his own joys or sorrows seriously. He could feel that the emotions of the individual matter, and that tragic occurrences deserve to be celebrated in immortal verse. But the modern man, when misfortune assails him, is conscious of himself as a unit in a statistical total; the past and the future stretch before him in a dreary procession of trivial defeats. Man himself appears as a somewhat ridiculous strutting animal, shouting and fussing during a brief interlude between infinite silences.","Ages of prolonged uncertainty, while they are compatible with the highest degree of saintliness in a few, are inimical to the prosaic every-day virtues of respectable citizens. There seems no use in thrift, when tomorrow all your savings may be dissipated; no advantage in honesty, when the man towards whom you practise it is pretty sure to swindle you; no point in steadfast adherence to the cause, when no cause is important or has a chance of stable victory; no argument in favour of truthfulness, when only supple tergiversation makes the preservation of life and fortune possible. The man whose virtue has no source except a purely terrestrial prudence will in such a world, become an adventurer if he has the courage, and, if not, will seek obscurity as a timid time-server.","\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0641\u0647\u0648 \u064a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0637\u0627\u0642\u0647 \u064a\u0633\u064a\u0637\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0635\u0649 \u062d\u062f \u0648\u064a\u062a\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0644\u0646\u062a\u0627\u0626\u062c \u062a\u0638\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0647\u0645\u064a\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0644\u0647 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0627 \u0641\u062d\u0633\u0628 \u0628\u0644 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u062c\u0632 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u062f\u0646\u0649 \u062f\u0631\u062c\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0647\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u062d\u0638\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0641\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0648\u062d\u0647 \u0644\u0648\u062d\u0647 \u0627\u0648 \u0642\u0635\u064a\u062f\u0647 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062a\u062c \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0631\u062f\u064a\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0641\u0647\u0645 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u064a\u0647 \u0641\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062a\u062c \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0643\u0627\u0641 \u0648\u062a\u0628\u0639\u0627 \u0644\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0646\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u064a\u0646\u0634\u062a\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0641 \u0645\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0628\u062c\u0644\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u0643 \u0627\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0639 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u064a\u0631\u0647","Our doings are not so important as we naturally suppose; our successes and failures do not after all matter very much.

But over and above these self-centered considerations is the fact that one\'s ego is no very large part of the world. The man who can center his thoughts and hopes upon something transcending self can find a certain peace in the ordinary troubles of life which is impossible to the pure egoist.","I do not think there can be any defense for the view that knowledge is ever undesirable.","a certain amount of boredom is...essential to a happy life","The special skill of the politician consists in knowing what passions can be most easily aroused, and how to prevent them, when aroused, from being harmful to himself and his associates...Moreover, since politicians are divided into rival groups, they aim at similarly dividing the nation, unless they have the good fortune to unite it in war against some other nation.","\u0644\u0627\u0628\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0641 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0635\u0641\u062d \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u064b\u0627\u060c \u0645\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0639 \u0646\u0637\u0627\u0642\u0647\u060c \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0633\u0628\u0642 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u062f\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u064a\u0629 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062c\u0639\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0626 \u062e\u0628\u064a\u0631\u064b\u0627. \u0628\u0644 \u0625\u0646 \u0623\u064a \u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0629 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0624\u062f\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0649 \u0641\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0644\u0623\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0621\u060c \u0648\u0625\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0648\u0628\u060c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062c\u0627\u0646\u0628 \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0643\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0643\u0632 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0639\u062f\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0627\u0637\u0651\u0644\u0639 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a.","To abandon the struggle for private happiness, to expel all eagerness of temporary desire, to burn with passion for eternal things -

It is not goodeither to forget the questions that philosophy asks, or to persuade ourselves that we have foundindubitable answers to them. To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without beingparalyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can still do for thosewho study it.","Knowledge exists, and good will exists; but both remain impotent until they possess the proper organs for making themselves heard.","Liberation from the tyranny of the body contributes to greatness, but just as much to greatness in sin as to greatness in virtue.","It is we who create value and our desires which confer value. In this realm we are kings, and we debase our kingship if we bow down to Nature. It is for us to determine the good life, not for Nature - not even for Nature personified as God.","Some of the deepest truths are simple, when seen in the clearest light, and it takes a lucid intellect to grasp them so thoroughly that their simplicity can be brought into that light and offered to all, not just the privileged few.","Noone has yet succeeded in inventing a philosophy at once credible and self-consistent. Locke aimed at credibility, and achieved it at the expense of consistency. Most of the great philosophers have done the opposite. A philosophy which is not self-consistent cannot be wholly true, but a philosophy which is self-consistent can very well be wholly false. The most fruitful philosophies have contained glaring inconsistencies, but for that very reason have been partially true. There is no reason to suppose that a self-consistent system contains more truth than one which, like Locke\u2019s, is more or less wrong.","Man needs, for his happiness, not merely the enjoyment of this or that, but hope, and enterprise and change.","In the modern world, those whom we effectively hate are distant groups, especially foreign nations. We conceive them abstractly, and deceive ourselves into the belief that acts which are really embodiments of hatred are done from love or justice or some lofty motive. Only a large measure of skepticism can tear away the veils which hide this truth from us.","There is one very serious defect to my mind in Christ\'s moral character, and that is that He believed in hell. I do not myself feel that any person who is really profoundly humane can believe in everlasting punishment...... There are other things of less importance. There is the instance of the Gadarene swine where it certainly was not very kind to the pigs to put devils into them and make them rush down the hill to the sea. You must remember that He was omnipotent, and He could have made the devils simply go away; but he chooses to send them into the pigs. Then there is the curious story of the fig-tree, which always rather puzzled me. You remember what happened about the fig-tree. \'He was hungry; and seeing a fig-tree afar off having leaves, He came if haply He might find anything thereon; and when He came to it He found nothing but leaves, for the time for figs was not yet. And Jesus answered and said unto it: \\"No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever,\\"...and Peter... saith unto Him: \\"Master, behold the fig-tree which thou cursedst is withered away\\".\' This is a very curious story, because it was not the right time of year for figs, and you really could not blame the tree. I cannot myself feel that either in matter of wisdom or in matter of virtue Christ stands quite as high as some other people known to history. I think I should put Buddha and Socrates above Him in those respects.","When a child reaches adolescence, there is very apt to be a conflict between parents and child, since the latter considers himself to be by now quite capable of managing his own affairs, while the former are filled with parental solicitude, which is often a disguise for love of power. Parents consider, usually, that the various moral problems which arise in adolescence are peculiarly their province. The opinions they express, however, are so dogmatic that the young seldom confide in them, and usually go their own way in secret.","One of the most powerful of all our passions is the desire to be admired and respected. As things stand, admiration and respect are given to the man who seems to be rich. This is the chief reason why people wish to be rich. The actual goods purchased by their money play quite a secondary part.","It is a natural propensity to attribute misfortune to someone\u2019s malignity. When prices rise, it is due to the profiteer; when wages fall, it is due to the capitalist. Why the capitalist is ineffective when wages rise, and the profiteer when prices fall, the man in the street does not inquire. Nor does he notice that wages and prices rise and fall together. If he is a capitalist, he wants wages to fall and prices to rise; if he is a wage earner, he wants the opposite. When a currency expert tries to explain that profiteers and trade unions and ordinary employers have very little to do with the matter, he irritates everybody, like the man who threw doubt on German atrocities. (In World War I) We do not like to be robbed of an enemy; we want someone to have when we suffer. It is so depressing to think taht we suffer because we are fools; yet taking mankind in mass, that is the truth. For this reason, no political party can acquire any driving force except through hatred; it must hold someone to obloquy. If so-and-so\u2019s wickedness is the sole cause of our misery, let us punish so-and-so and we shall be happy. The supreme example of this kind of political thought was the Treaty of Versailles. Yet most people are only seeking some new scapegoat to replace the Germans.","It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions makes it impossible to earn a living. It is clear also that thought is not free if all the arguments on one side of a controversy are perpetually presented as attractively as possible, while the arguments on the other side can only be discovered by diligent search.","You may kill an artist or a thinker, but you cannot acquire his art or his thought.","...love must feel the ego of the beloved person as important as one\'s own ego, and must realize the other\'s feelings and wishes as though they were one\'s own.","A truly scientific philosophy will be more humble, more piecemeal, more arduous, offering less glitter of outward mirage to flatter fallacious hopes, but more indifferent to fate, and more capable of accepting the world without the tyrannous imposition of our human and temporary demands.","\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u0631\u062f\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0643\u0644 \u0635\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0647","Intellectually, what is stimulating to a young man is a problem of obvious practical importance. A young man learning economics, for example, ought to hear lectures from individualists and socialists, protectionists and free-traders, inflationists and believers in the gold standard. He ought to be encouraged to read the best books of the various schools, as recommended by those who believe in them. This would teach him to weigh arguments and evidence, to know that no pinion is certainly right, and to judge men by their quality rather than by their consonance with preconceptions.","Liberty demands self-government, but not the right to interfere with others.","It is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age; but, if so,it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that gaurds the door,and this dragon is religion","The method of \'postulating\' what we want has many advantages ; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil.","It is obvious that in his day-dreams he is a warrior, not a professor; all of the men he admires were military. His opinion of women, like every man\'s, is an objectification of his own emotion towards them, which is obviously one of fear. \\"Forget not thy whip\\"-- but nine women out of ten would get the whip away from him, and he knew it, so he kept away from women, and soothed his wounded vanity with unkind remarks. [...] [H]e is so full of fear and hatred that spontaneous love of mankind seems to him impossible. He has never conceived of the man who, with all the fearlessness and stubborn pride of the superman, nevertheless does not inflict pain because he has no wish to do so. Does any one suppose that Lincoln acted as he did from fear of hell? Yet to Nietzsche, Lincoln is abject, Napoleon magnificent. [...] I dislike Nietzsche because he likes the contemplation of pain, because he erects conceit into duty, because the men whom he most admires are conquerors, whose glory is cleverness in causing men to die. But I think the ultimate argument against his philosophy, as against any unpleasant but internally self-conscious ethic, lies not in an appeal to facts, but in an appeal to the emotions. Nietzsche despises universal love; I feel it the motive power to all that I desire as regards the world. His followers have had their innings, but we may hope that it is coming rapidly to an end.","Has the universe any unity of plan or purpose, or is it a fortuitous concourse of atoms? Is conciousness a permanent part of the universe, giving hope of indefinite growth in wisdom, or is it a transitory accident on a small planet on which life must ultimately become impossible? Are good and evil of importance to the universe or only to man?","\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0645\u062a\u0639 \u0628\u0625\u0636\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0648\u0642\u062a\u0627 \u0636\u0627\u0626\u0639\u0627\u064b.","I must, I must before I die find some way to say the essential thing that is in me, that I have never said yet \u2013 a thing that is not love or hate or pity or scorn but the very breath of life... I want to bring back into the world of men some little bit of new wisdom. There is a little wisdom in the world; Heraclitus, Spinoza, and a saying here and there. I want to add to it, even if ever so little.","Nor have the lives of great men been exciting except at a few great moments. Socrates could enjoy a banquet now and again, and must have derived considerable satisfaction from his conversations while the hemlock was taking effect, but most of his life he lived quietly with Xanthippe, taking a constitutional in the afternoon, and perhaps meeting a few friends by the way. Kant is said never to have been more thanten miles from from konigsberg in all his life. Darwin, after going round the world, spent the whole of the rest of his life in his own house. Marx, after stirring up a few revolutions, decided to spend the remainderof his days in the British Museum.

The main cause is always comfort without power. The holders of power are not cynical, since they are able to enforce their ideals.

Eleven of them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to the twelfth. this traveler was on the right lines. But in countries which do not enjoy Mediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great public propaganda will be required to inaugurate it.

These landowners are idle, and I might therefore be expected to praise them. Unfortunately, their idleness is only rendered possible by the industry of others; indeed their desire for comfortable idleness is historically the source of the whole gospel of work.

All such philosophies spring from self-importance, and are best corrected by a little astronomy.","The antidote, in so far as it is a matter of individual psychology, is to be found in history, biology, astronomy, and all those studies which, without destroying self-respect, enable the individual to see himself in his proper perspective. What is needed is not this or that specific piece of information, but such knowledge as inspires a conception of the ends of human life as a whole: art and history, acquaintance with the lives of heroic individuals, and some understanding of the strangely accidental and ephemeral position of man in the cosmos - all this touched with an emotion of pride in what is distinctively human, the power to see and to know, to feel magnanimously and to think with understanding. It is from large perceptions combined with impersonal emotion that wisdom most readily springs.","It is amazing how much both happiness and efficiency can be increased by the cultivation of an orderly mind, which thinks about a matter adequately at the right time rather than inadequately at all times. When a difficult or worrying decision has to be reached, as soon as all the data are available, give the matter your best thought and make your decision; having made the decision, do not revise it unless some new fact comes to your knowledge. Nothing is so exhausting as indecision, and nothing is so futile.","For the young, there is nothing unattainable; a good thing desired with the whole force of a passionate will, and yet impossible, is to them not credible. Yet, by death, by illness, by poverty, or by the voice of duty, we must learn, each one of us, that the world was not made for us, and that, however beautiful may be the things we crave, Fate may nevertheless forbid them. It is the part of courage, when misfortune comes, to bear without regretting the ruin of our hopes, to turn away our thoughts from vain regrets. This degree of submission to power is not only just and right: it is the very gate of wisdom.","It might seem that the empirical philosopher is the slave of his material, but that the pure mathematician, like the musician, is a free creator of his world of ordered beauty.","Some things are believed because people feel as if they must be true, and in such cases an immense weight of evi\xaddence is necessary to dispel the belief.","Those who defend traditional morality will sometimes admit that it is not perfect, but contend that any criticism will make all morality crumble.","Among ourselves (Westerners), the people who are regarded as moral luminaries are those who forgo ordinary pleasures themselves and find compensation in interfering with the pleasures of others.","\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0623\u0642\u0635\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0636\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0629.","My desire and wish is that the things I start with should be so obvious that you wonder why I spend my time stating them.

What physicist who was active in 1900 would dream of boasting that his opinions had not changed?","Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen, instead, to have overwork for some and starvation for the others. Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines; in this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish for ever.","Modesty... consists in pretending not to think better of ourselves and our belongings than of the man we are speaking to and his belongings.","Since this craving (for material possessions) is in the nature of competition, it only brings happiness when we outdistance a rival, to whom it brings correlative pain.","In the modern world, however, love has another enemy more dangerous than religion, and that is the gospel of work and economic success.

He inquired at Manchester whether there was such a subject and whether anybody worked at it. They told him about me, and so he came to Cambridge. He was queer, and his notions seemed to me odd, so that for a whole term I could not make up my mind whether he was a man of genius or merely an eccentric. At the end of his first term at Cambridge he came to me and said: \u201cWill you please tell me whether I am a complete idiot or not? I replied, \u201cMy dear fellow, I don\u2019t know. Why are you asking me?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause, if I am a complete idiot, I shall become an aeronaut; but, if not, I shall become a philosopher.\u201d I told him to write me something during the vacation on some philosophical subject and I would then tell him whether he was complete idiot or not. At the beginning of the following term he brought me the fulfillment of this suggestion. After reading only one sentence, I said to him: \u201cNo, you must not become an aeronaut.\u201d And he didn\u2019t.The collected papers of Bertrand Russell: Last Philosophical Testament\u201d","\u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0631\u0641. \u0647\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u060c \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0630\u0627\u0647\u0628. \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629. \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u0642\u0637 \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u062d\u0631 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0627. \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0643\u0631\u064a \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0634\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0647\u0648 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0645\u0641\u064a\u062f \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u062d\u0631 \u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0634\u0629 \u0623\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062f\u0639\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0624\u0644 \u0628\u062d\u062c\u062c \u0642\u0648\u064a\u0629. \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0623\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0623\u0648\u0644\u0626\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0633\u0645\u064a\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0631\u060c \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0639\u0644 \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0634\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0636\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0645\u0644 \u062a\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0628\u064a. \\"- \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0631\u0627\u0633\u0644 \u0641\u064a\\" \u0623\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0631\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0635\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0644\u064a \\"\u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0646\u0634\u0631\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0629 \u0646\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0643 \u062a\u0627\u064a\u0645\u0632 (1951)","[If] we wish to diminish the love of money which, we are told, is the root of all evil, the first step must be the creation of a system in which everyone has enough and no one has too much.","The lunatic who thinks he is a crowned head may be, in a sense, happy, but his happiness is not of a kind that any sane person would envy.","Narcissism is, in a sense, the converse of an habitual sense of sin; it consists in the habit of admiring oneself and wishing to be admired. Up to a point it is, of course, normal, and not to be deplored; it is only in its excesses that it becomes a grave evil. In many women, especially rich Society women, the capacity for feeling love is completely dried up, and is replaced by a powerful desire that all men should love them. When a woman of this kind is sure that a man loves her, she has no further use for him. The same thing occurs, though less frequently, with men; the classic example is the hero of Liaisons Dangereuses. When vanity is carried to this height, there is no genuine interest in any other person, and therefore no real satisfaction to be obtained from love.","Kita tidak bisa menjamin kesejahteraan kita, kecuali dengan menjamin kesejahteraan orang-orang lain juga.Jika anda bahagia, anda harus rela mengusahakan orang-orang lain agar bahagia pula.","\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0644\u062e\u0635 \u0641\u0649 \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0648\u0631 \u0648\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0641\u0649 \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0648 \u064a\u0645\u0633 \u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0634\u0639\u0631\u0647.","I think that in all descriptions of the good life here on earth we must assume a certain basis of animal vitality and animal instinct; without this, life becomes tame and uninteresting. Civilization should be something added to this, not substituted for it; the ascetic saint and the detached sage fail in this respect to be complete human beings. A small number of them may enrich a community; but a world composed of them would die of boredom.","Many of the actions by which men have become rich are far more harmful to the community than the obscure crimes of poor men, yet they go unpunished because they do not interfere with the existing order.","The slave is doomed to worship Time and Fate and Death, because they are greater than anything he finds in himself, and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour. But, great as they are, to think of them greatly, to feel their passionless splendour, is greater still. And such thought makes us free men; we no longer bow before the inevitable in Oriental subjection, but we absorb it, and make it a part of ourselves.","But even when a man has offended against his own rational code, I doubt whether a sense of sin is the best method of arriving at a better way of life. There is in the sense of sin something abject, something lacking in self-respect. No good was ever done to any one by the loss of self-respect. The rational man will regard his own undesirable acts, as he regards those of others, as acts produced by certain circumstances, and to be avoided either by a fuller realization that they are undesirable, or, where this is possible, by avoidance of the circumstances that caused them.","The observer, when he seems to himself to be observing a stone, is really, if physics is to be believed, observing the effects of the stone upon himself. Thus science seems to be at war with itself: when it most means to be objective, it finds itself plunged into subjectivity against its will. Naive realism leads to physics, and physics, if true, shows that naive realism is false. Therefore naive realism, if true, is false; therefore it is false.","The demand for certainty is one which is natural to man, but is nevertheless an intellectual vice. ...

But scientific philosophy comes nearer to objectivity than any other human pursuit, and gives us, therefore, the closest constant and the most intimate relation with the outer world that it is possible to achieve.","A dog cannot relate his autobiography; however, eloquently he may bark, he cannot tell you that his parents were honest though poor.","Great ages and great individuals have arisen from the breakdown of a rigid system: the rigid system has given the necessary discipline and coherence, while its breakdown has releaed the necessary energy. (...) No doubt the ideal is a certain rigidity of action plus a certain plasticity of thought, but this is diffcult to achieve in practice except during brief transitional periods.","The demand for certainty is one which is natural to man, but is nevertheless an intellectual vice. [...] To endure uncertainty is difficult, but so are most of the other virtues.","The value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. . . .--From The Problems of Philosophy (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1912).","If all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it is difficult not to demand of life more than it has to give. And to demand too much is the surest way of getting even less than is possible.","There is a special department of Hell for students of probability. In this department there are many typewriters and many monkeys. Every time that a monkey walks on a typewriter, it types by chance one of Shakespeare\'s sonnets.","Next to enjoying ourselves, the next greatest pleasure consists in preventing others from enjoying themselves, or, more generally, in the acquisition of power. Consequently those who live under the dominion of Puritanism become exceedingly desirous of power. Now love of power does far more harm than love of drink or any of the other vices against which Puritans protest. Of course, in virtuous people love of power camouflages itself as love of doing good, but this makes very little difference to its social effects. It merely means that we punish our victims for being wicked, instead of for being our enemies. In either case, tyranny and war result. Moral indignation is one of the most harmful forces in the modern world, the more so as it can always be diverted to sinister uses by those who control propaganda.","Religion prevents our children from having a rational education; religion prevents us from removing the fundamental causes of war; religion prevents us from teaching the ethic of scientific co-operation in place of the old fierce doctrines of sin and punishment. It is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age; but, if so, it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door, and this dragon is religion.","Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting fairy tales.","The extent to which beliefs are based upon evidence is very much less than believers suppose. Take the kind of action which is most nearly rational: the investment of money by a rich City man. You will often find that his view (say) on the question whether the French franc will go up or down depends upon his political sympathies, and yet is so strongly held that he is prepared to risk money on it.","The search for something permanent is one of the deepest of the instincts leading men to philosophy.

Therefore every orgy of unreason in the end strengthens the friends of reason, and shows afresh that they are the only true friends of humanity.","The need of politeness is at its maximum in speaking with foreigners, and is so irksome as to be paralysing to those who are only accustomed to compatriots.","During the war, the holders of power in all countries found it necessary to bribe the populations into cooperation by unusual concessions. Wage-earners were allowed a living wage, Hindus were told they were men and brothers, women were given the vote, and young people were allowed to enjoy those innocent pleasures of which the old, in the name of morality, always wish to rob them. The war being won, the victors set to work to deprive their tools of advantages temporarily conceded.","It is quite impossible to guess in advance what will interest a man, but most men are capable of a keen interest in something or other, and when once such an interest has been aroused their life becomes free from tedium.","\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u062a\u0633\u0628 \u0628\u062a\u0623\u0646\u0651\u064d \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0648\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062c\u0644\u0628\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0644\u0634\u064a\u0648\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a, \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0631\u0629 \u062a\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0647\u0627","In the first place, there is no point whatever in being able to spell anything.

We must pass through it quickly, for if we do not, most of us will perish by the wa y, and the others will be lost in a forest of doubt and fear. Envy therefore, evil as it is, and terrible as are its effects, is not wholly of the devil. It is in part the expression of a heroic pain, the pain of those who walk through the night blindly, p erhaps to a better resting-place, perhaps only to death and destruction. To find the right road out of this despair civ ilised man must enlarge his heart as he has enlarged his mind. He must learn to tran scend self, and in so doing to acquire the freedom of the Universe.","Will machines destroy emotions or will emotions destroy machines?","At every moment of life the civilised man is hedged about by restrictions of impulse: if he happens to feel cheerful he must not sing or dance in the street, while if he happens to feel sad he must not sit on the pavement and weep, for fear of obstructing pedestrian traffic. In youth his liberty is restricted at school, in adult life it is restricted throughout his working hours. All this makes zest more difficult to retain, for the co ntinual restraint tends to produce wearin ess and boredom. Nevertheless, a civilised society is impossible without a very considerable degree of restraint upon spontaneous impulse, since spontaneous impulse will only produce the simplest forms of social c ooperation, not those highly complex forms which modern economic organisation demands","My advice to anyone who wishes to write is to know all the very best literature by heart, and ignore the rest as completely as possible.","First: never use a long word if a short word will do. Second: if you want to make a statement with a great many qualifications, put some of the qualifications in separate sentences. Third: do not let the beginning of your sentence lead the reader to an expectation which is contradicted by the end.","Suppose you are walking in a thunderstorm, and you say to yourself, \u201cI am not at all likely to be struck by lightning.

I think myself that this theory is true. But there is no department of practical politics where idealistic theories are strong enough to cause great changes; when great changes occur, the theories which justify them are always a camouflage for passion. And the passion that has given driving force to democratic theories is undoubtedly the passion of envy.","Almost all philosophers, in their ethical systems, first lay down a false doctrine, and then argue that wickedness consists in acting in a manner that proves it false, which would be impossible if the doctrine were true.","To say shortly why one values love is not easy; nevertheless, I will make the attempt. Love is to be valued in the first instance - and this, though not its greatest value, is essential to all the rest - as in itself a source of delight.Oh Love! they wrong thee muchThat say thy sweet is bitter,When thy rich fruit is suchAs nothing can be sweeter.The anonymous author of these lines was not seeking a solution for atheism, or a key to the universe; he was merely enjoying himself. And not only is love a source of delight, but its absence is a source of pain. In the second place, love is to be valued because it enhances all the best pleasures, such as music, and sunrise in mountains, and the sea under the full moon. A man who has never enjoyed beautiful things in the company of a woman whom he loved has not experienced to the full the magic of power of which such things are capable. Again, love is able to break down the hard shell of the ego, since it is a form of biological cooperation in which the emotions of each are necessary to the fulfilment of the other\'s instinctive purposes.","Nature and books and (later) mathematics saved me from complete despondency.","It is not rational arguments but emotions that cause belief in a future life.","A strange mystery it is that Nature, omnipotent but blind, in the revolutions of her secular hurryings through the abysses of space, has brought forth at last a child subject still to her power but gifted with sight, with knowledge of good and evil, with the capacity of judging all the works of his unthinking mother.","A man is not allowed to practise medicine unless he knows something of the human body, but a financier is allowed to operate freely without any knowledge at all of the multifarious effects of his activities, with the sole exception of the effect upon his bank account.","Every advance in civilization has been denounced as unnatural while it was recent.","A man cannot possibly be at peace with others until he has learned to be at peace with himself.","\u0645\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0632\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0627 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0639\u062f\u0648\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0627 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f","A man of adequate vitality and zest will surmount all misfortunes by the emergence after each blow of an interest in life and the world which cannot be narrowed down so much as to make one loss fatal. To be defeated by one loss or even by several is not something to be admired as a proof of sensibility, but something to be deplored as a failure in vitality. All our affections are at the mercy of death, which may strike down those whom we love at any moment. It is therefore necessary that our lives should not have that narrow intensity which puts the whole meaning and purpose of our life at the mercy of accident.","Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.","It may be laid down broadly that irrationalism, i.e., disbelief in objective fact, arises almost always from the desire to assert something for which there is no evidence, or to deny something for which there is very good evidence.","In general, I find that things that have happened to me out of doors have made a deeper impression than things that have happened indoors.","Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves lonelines - that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what - at last - I have found.With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.","Most men think that in framing their political opinions they are actuated by desire for the public good; but 9 times out of 10 a man\u2019s politics can be predicted from the way in which he makes a living. This has led some people to maintain, and many more to believe practically, that in such matters it is impossible to be objective, and that no method is possible except a tug-of-war between classes with opposite bias.","The bulk of the population of every country is persuaded that all marriage customs other than its own are immoral, and that those who combat this view only do so in order to justify their own loose lives.","only a foolish asceticism, usually vicarious, makes us continue to insist on work in excessive quantities now that the need no longer exists.","The fact is that moving matter about, while a certain amount of it is necessary to our existence, is emphatically not one of the ends of human life. If it were, we should have to consider every navvy superior to Shakespeare. We have been misled in this matter by two causes. One is the necessity of keeping the poor contented, which has led the rich, for thousands of years, to preach the dignity of labor, while taking care themselves to remain undignified in this respect. The other is the new pleasure in mechanism, which makes us delight in the astonishingly clever changes that we can produce on the earth\'s surface. Neither of these motives makes any great appeal to the actual worker. If you ask him what he thinks the best part of his life, he is not likely to say: \\"I enjoy manual work because it makes me feel that I am fulfilling man\'s noblest task, and because I like to think how much man can transform his planet. It is true that my body demands periods of rest, which I have to fill in as best I may, but I am never so happy as when the morning comes and I can return to the toil from which my contentment springs.","I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contained, I stand and look at them long and long. They do not sweat and whine about their condition, They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins, They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God, Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things, Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago, Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth. \xa0 Walt Whitman","\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0649 \u064a\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0627\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0646\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0636, \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0646\u0649, \u0648\u0641\u0649 \u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 , \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u062c\u062f \u0645\u062b\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627, \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u062d\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0645\u0633\u0628\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0646\u062a\u0627\u0626\u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627, \u0648\u0627\u0646, \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0645\u062e\u0627\u0648\u0641\u0647, \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0634\u0642\u0647 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0624\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0647, \u0645\u0627\u0647\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0646\u062a\u0627\u0626\u062c \u062a\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0634\u0648\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0631\u0627\u062a, \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0637\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0634\u0639\u0648\u0631 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0641\u0643\u0631 \u0628\u0645\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0628\u0642\u0627\u0621 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0641\u0631\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0631 , \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u0643\u0644 \u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0645 \u062a\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0633\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0643\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0644\u0647\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0648\u0643\u0644 \u0636\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0643\u0648\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0646\u064a, \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0628\u0625\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0632\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062f\u0641\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u062a \u0623\u0646\u0642\u0627\u0636 \u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0627\u0644\u0643 . \u0643\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 -\u0625\u0646 \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0643\u0646 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0646\u0642\u0636 - \u0641\u0647\u064a \u0634\u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0624\u0643\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u0641\u0636\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629.!!!!","All knowledge, we find, must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing is left.","Grammar and ordinary language are bad guides to metaphysics.

But there is no obvious means of altering education and the Press until our political system is altered. From this dilemma there is no issue by means of ordinary action, at any rate for a long time to come.

In order to bring himself to say this, a man must destroy in himself all feelings of mercy and compassion. He must, in short, make himself as cruel as the God in whom he believes. No man who believes that all is for the best in this suffering world can keep his ethical values unimpaired, since he is always having to find excuses for pain and misery. \xa0 \xa0 The","The way of man has no wisdom, but that of God has\u2026.

The wisest man is an ape compared to God, just as the most beautiful ape is ugly compared to man.","I must say that I think all this doctrine, that hell-fire is a punishment for sin, is a doctrine of cruelty. It is a doctrine that put cruelty into the world and gave the world generations of cruel torture; and the Christ of the Gospels, if you could take Him as His chroniclers represent Him, would certainly have to be considered partly responsible for that.","Intelligibility or precision: to combine the two is impossible.","Organic life, we are told, has developed gradually from the protozoon to the philosopher; and this development, we are assured, is indubitably an advance. Unfortunately, it is the philosopher, not the protozoon, who gives us this assurance.","The world needs wisdom as it has never needed it before; and if knowledge continues to increase, the world will need wisdom in the future even more than it does now.","In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held. Contempt interferes with the first part of this process, and reverence with the second. Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intelligence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on any subject whatever. When an intelligent man expresses a view which seems to us obviously absurd, we should not attempt to prove that it is somehow true, but we should try to understand how it ever came to seem true. This exercise of historical and psychological imagination at once enlarges the scope of our thinking, and helps us to realize how foolish many of our own cherished prejudices will seem to an age which has a different temper of mind.","Among these surprising possibilities, doubt suggests that perhaps there is no table at all. Philosophy, if it cannot answer so many questions as we could wish, has at least the power of asking questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.","The whole conception of \'sin\' is one which I find very puzzling, doubtless owing to my sinful nature.","Certain things are indispensable to the happiness of most men, but these are simple things: food and shelter, health, love, successful work and the respect of one\'s own herd.","Of all the studies by which men acquire citizenship of the intellectual commonwealth, no single one is so indispensable as the study of the past.","We ought to make the best we can of the world, and if it is not so good as we wish, after all it will still be better than what these others have made of it in all these ages. A good world needs knowledge, kindliness, and courage; it does not need a regretful hankering after the past or a fettering of the free intelligence by the words uttered long ago by ignorant men. It needs a fearless outlook and a free intelligence. It needs hope for the future, not looking back all the time toward a past that is dead, which we trust will be far surpassed by the future that our intelligence can create.","A woman who has acquired any kind of professional skill ought, both for her own sake and for that of the community, to be free to continue to exercise this skill in spite of motherhood. She may be unable to do so during the later months of pregnancy and during lactation, but a child over nine months old ought not to form an insuperable barrier to its mother\'s professional activities. Whenever society demands of a mother sacrifices to her child which go beyond reason, the mother, if she is not unusually saintly, will expect from her child compensations exceeding those she has a right to expect.","There was once upon a time a census officer who had to record the names of all householders in a certain Welsh village. The first that he questioned was called William Williams; so were the second, third, fourth.... At last he said to himself: \u2018This is tedious; evidently they are all called William Williams. I shall put them down so and take a holiday\u2019. But he was wrong; there was just one whose name was John Jones. This shows that we may go astray if we trust too implicitly to induction by simple enumeration.","Look into the irrationality closely, with a determination not to respect it, and not to let it dominate you. Whenever it thrusts foolish thoughts or feelings into your consciousness, pull them up by the roots, examine them, and reject them.","Every civilized man or woman has, I suppose, some picture of himself or herself, and is annoyed when anything happens that seems to spoil this picture. The best cure is to have not only one picture, but a whole gallery, and to select the one appropriate to the incident in question. If some of the portraits are a trifle laughable, so much the better; it is not wise to see oneself all day long as a hero of high tragedy.","The result of the scientific work we have been considering was that the outlook of educated men was completely transformed. At the beginning of the century, Sir Thomas Browne took part in trials for witchcraft; at the end, such a thing would have been impossible. In Shakespeare\'s time, comets were still portents; after the publication of Newton\'s Principia in 1687, it was known that he and Halley had calculated the orbits of certain comets, and that they were as obedient as the planets to the law of gravitation. The reign of law had established its hold on men\'s imaginations, making such things as magic and sorcery incredible. In 1700 the mental outlook of educated men was completely modern; in 1600, except among a very few, it was still largely medieval.","What we shall desire for individuals is now clear: strong creative impulses, overpowering and absorbing the instinct of possession; reverence for others; respect for the fundamental creative impulse in ourselves. A certain kind of self-respect or native pride is necessary to a good life; a man must not have a sense of utter inward defeat if he is to remain whole, but must feel the courage and the hope and the will to live by the best that is in him, whatever outward or inward obstacles it may encounter. So far as it lies in a man\u2019s own power, his life will realize its best possibilities if it has three things: creative rather than possessive impulses, reverence for others, and respect for the fundamental impulse in himself.","We all start from \u201cnaive realism, i.e., the doctrine that thingsare what they seem.

It was fortunate that, while theology was almost the sole surviving mental activity, the system that was accepted was not purely superstitious, but preserved, though sometimes deeply buried, doctrines which embodied much of the work of Greek intellect and much of the moral devotion that is common to the Stoics and the Neoplatonists. This made possible the rise of the scholastic philosophy, and later, with the Renaissance, the stimulus derived from the renewed study of Plato, and thence of the other ancients. On the other hand, the philosophy of Plotinus has the defect of encouraging men to look within rather than to look without: when we look within we see nous, which is divine, while when we look without we see the imperfections of the sensible world.

In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held.

This is no new discovery. The Gospel says: \u201cTake no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? The thought we give to these things is taken away from matters of more importance. And what is worse, the habit of mind engendered by thinking of these things is a bad one; it leads to competition, envy, domination, cruelty, and almost all the moral evils that infest the world. In particular, it leads to the predatory use of force. Material possessions can be taken by force and enjoyed by the robber. Spiritual possessions cannot be taken in this way.\u201d","Science tells us what we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive to many things of very great importance. Theology, on the other hand, induces a dogmatic belief that we have knowledge where in fact we have ignorance, and by doing so generates a kind of impertinent insolence towards the universe. Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting fairy tales.","there is no profit in feeling unless one learns to dominate it and impersonalise it. -","Mathematics takes us still further from what is human into the region of absolute necessity, to which not only the actual world, but ever possible world, must conform.","In a man whose reasoning powers are good, fallacious arguments are evidence of bias.","Thus mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.","A child develops best when, like a young plant, he is left undisturbed in the same soil. Too much travel, too much variety of impressions, are not good for the young, and cause them as they grow up to become incapable of enduring fruitful monotony.","The difficulty is that, so long as unreason prevails, a solution of our troubles can only be reached by chance; for while reason, being impersonal, makes universal co-operation possible, unreason, since it represents private passions, makes strife inevitable. It is for this reason that rationality, in the sense of an appeal to a universal and impersonal standard of truth, is of supreme importance to the well-being of the human species.","There is no department of practical politicswhere idealistic theories are strong enough tocause great changes; when great changes occur, thetheories which justify them are always acamouflage for passion. And the passion that hasgiven driving force to democratic theories isundoubtedly the passion of envy.","Everyone who realises at all what human life is must feel at some time the strange loneliness of every separate soul; and then the discovery in others of the same loneliness makes a new strange tie, and a growth of pity so warm as to be almost a compensation for what is lost.","You can get away from envy by enjoying the pleasures that come your way, by doing the work that you have to do, and by avoiding comparisons with those whom you imagine, perhaps quite falsely, to be more fortunate than yourself.","Like Spinoza, he has a certain kind of moral purity and loftiness, which is very impressive. He is always sincere, never shrill or censorious, invariably concerned to tell the reader, as simply as he can, what he believes to be important. Whatever one may think of him as a theoretical philosopher, it is impossible not to love him as a man. The life of Plotinus is known,","The romantic movement, in art, in literature, and in politics, is bond up with this subjective way of judging men, not as members of a community, but as aesthetically delightful objects of contemplation. Tigers are more beautiful than sheep, but we prefer them behind bars. The typical romantic removes the bars and enjoys the magnificent leaps with which the tiger annihilates the sheep. He exhorts men to imagine themselves tigers, and when he succeeds the results are not wholly pleasant.","It is clear that the most elementary condition, if thought is to be free, is the absence of legal penalties for the expression of opinions. No great country has yet reached to this level, although most of them think they have.","There is a widespread philosophical tendency towards the view which tells us that Man is the measure of all things, that truth is man-made, that space and time and the world of universals are properties of the mind, and that, if there be anything not created by the mind, it is unknowable and of no account for us. This view, if our previous discussions were correct, is untrue; but in addition to being untrue, it has the effect of robbing philosophic contemplation of all that gives it value, since it fetters contemplation to Self. What it calls knowledge is not a union with the not-Self, but a set of prejudices, habits, and desires, making an impenetrable veil between us and the world beyond. The man who finds pleasure in such a theory of knowledge is like a man who never leaves the domestic circle for fear his word might not be law.","The danger is one which democracy by itself does not suffice to avert. A democracy in which the majority exercises its power without restraint may be almost as tyrannical as a dictatorship. Toleration of minorities is an essential part of wise democracy, but a part which is not always sufficiently remembered.","If there is to be toleration in the world, one of the things taught in schools must be the habit of weighing evidence, and the practice of not giving full assent to propositions which there is no reason to believe true. For example, the art of reading the newspapers should be taught. The schoolmaster should select some incident which happened a good many years ago, and roused political passions in its day. 41 He should then read to the school children what was said by the newspapers on one side, what was said by those on the other, and some impartial account of what really happened. He should show how, from the biased account of either side, a practised reader could infer what really happened, and he should make them understand that everything in newspapers is more or less untrue. The cynical scepticism which would result from this teaching would make the children in later life immune from those appeals to idealism by which decent people are induced to further the schemes of scoundrels.","Domestic animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. We know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading. The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.","All who are not lunatics are agreed about certain things. That it is better to be alive than dead, better to be adequately fed than starved, better to be free than a slave. Many people desire those things only for themselves and their friends; they are quite content that their enemies should suffer. These people can be refuted by science: mankind has become so much one family that we cannot insure our own prosperity except by insuring that of everyone else. If you wish to be happy yourself, you must resign yourself to seeing others also happy.","In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held.","If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument. It is exactly of the same nature as the Hindu\'s view, that the world rested upon an elephant and the elephant rested upon a tortoise; and when they said, \\"How about the tortoise?\\" the Indian said, \\"Suppose we change the subject.\\" The argument is really no better than that. There is no reason why the world could not have come into being without a cause; nor, on the other hand, is there any reason why it should not have always existed. There is no reason to suppose that the world had a beginning at all. The idea that things must have a beginning is really due to the poverty of our imagination. Therefore, perhaps, I need not waste any more time upon the argument about the First Cause.","I think of sense, and of thoughts built on sense, as windows, not as prison bars. I think that we can, however imperfectly, mirror the world, like Leibnitz\u2019s monads; and I think it is the duty of the philosopher to make himself as undistorting a mirror as he can. But it is also his duty to recognize such distortions as are inevitable from our very nature. Of these, the most fundamental is that we view the world from the point of view of the here and now, not with that large impartiality which theists attribute to the Deity. To achieve such impartiality is impossible for us, but we can travel a certain distance towards it. To show the road to this end is the supreme duty of the philosopher.","In the whole theory of the material world, Cartesianism was rigidly deterministic. Living organisms, just as much as dead matter, were governed by the laws of physics; there was no longer need, as in the Aristotelian philosophy, of an entelechy or soul to explain the growth of organisms and the movements of animals. Descartes","IS THERE ANY KNOWLEDGE IN the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? This question, which at first sight might not seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that can be asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a straightforward and confident answer, we shall be well launched on the study of philosophy\u2014for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer such ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in ordinary life and even in the sciences, but critically, after exploring all that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the vagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.","Education should have two objects: first, to give definite knowledge\u2014reading and writing, languages and mathematics, and so on; secondly, to create those mental habits which will enable people to acquire knowledge and form sound judgments for themselves.","Politicians do not find any attractions in a view which does not lend itself to party declamation, and ordinary mortals prefer views which attribute misfortune to the machinations of their enemies.","Our system of education turns young people out of the schools able to read, but for the most part unable to weigh evidence or to form an independent opinion. They are then assailed, throughout the rest of their lives, by statements designed to make them believe all sorts of absurd propositions, such as that Blank\u2019s pills cure all ills, that Spitzbergen is warm and fertile, and that Germans eat corpses.","What most distinguishes Confucius from other founders is that he inculcated a strict code of ethics, which has been respected ever since, but associated with very little religious dogma, which gave place to complete theological scepticism in the countless generations of Chinese literati who revered his memory and administered the Empire.","The mind of the most rational among us may be compared to a stormy ocean of passionate convictions based on desire, upon which float perilously a few tiny boats carrying a cargo of scientifically tested beliefs.","The circumstances of men\'s lives do much to determine their philosophy, but, conversely, their philosophy does much to determine their circumstances.","Science tells us what we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive to many things of great importance. Theology induces a dogmatic belief that we have knowledge where in fact we have ignorance, and by doing so generates a kind of impertinent insolence towards the universe. Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting fairy tales.","it is sad really to see the kind of boys that are common everywhere. No mind, no independent thought, no love of good books nor of the higher refinements of morality. It is really sad that the upper classes of a civilised and (supposed to be) moral country can produce nothing better.","It is curious that Mill makes very little mention of the police as a danger to liberty. In our day they are its worst enemy...","There are things that are valued more than pleasure; no one would be content to go through life with a child\'s intellect, even if it were pleasant to do so. Each animal has its proper pleasure, and the proper pleasure of man is connected with reason.","All definite knowledge\u2014so I should contend\u2014belongs to science; all dogma as to what surpasses definite knowledge belongs to theology. But between theology and science there is a No Man\'s Land, exposed to attack from both sides; this No Man\'s Land is philosophy.","It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions makes it impossible to earn a living. It is clear also that thought is not free if all the arguments on one side of a controversy are perpetually presented as attractively as possible, while the arguments on the other side can only be discovered by diligent search. Both these obstacles exist in every large country known to me, except China, which is the last refuge of freedom.","The citizens of Athens, like those of other cities in other ages and continents, showed a certain hostility to those who attempted to introduce a higher level of culture than that to which they were accustomed.","The skill of the politician consists in guessing what people can be brought to think advantageous to themselves; the skill of the experts consists in calculating what really is advantageous, provided people can be brought to think so. (The proviso is essential, because measures which arouse serious resentment are seldom advantageous, whatever merits they may have otherwise.) The power of the politician, in a democracy, depends upon his adopting the opinions which seem right to the average man. It is useless to urge that politicians ought to be high-minded enough to advocate what enlightened opinion considers good, because if they do they are swept aside for others.","But truth is not the only merit that a metaphysic can possess. It may have beauty, and this is certainly to be found in Plotinus; there are passages that remind one of the later cantos of Dante\'s Para- diso, and of almost nothing else in literature. Now","When, without the bitterness of impotent rebellion, we have learnt both to resign ourselves to the outward rules of Fate and to recognise that the non-human world is unworthy of our worship, it becomes possible at last so to transform and refashion the unconscious universe, so to transmute it in the crucible of imagination, that a new image of shining gold replaces the old idol of clay. In all the multiform facts of the world--in the visual shapes of trees and mountains and clouds, in the events of the life of man, even in the very omnipotence of Death--the insight of creative idealism can find the reflection of a beauty which its own thoughts first made. In this way mind asserts its subtle mastery over the thoughtless forces of Nature. The more evil the material with which it deals, the more thwarting to untrained desire, the greater is its achievement in inducing the reluctant rock to yield up its hidden treasures, the prouder its victory in compelling the opposing forces to swell the pageant of its triumph. Of all the arts, Tragedy is the proudest, the most triumphant; for it builds its shining citadel in the very centre of the enemy\'s country, on the very summit of his highest mountain; from its impregnable watchtowers, his camps and arsenals, his columns and forts, are all revealed; within its walls the free life continues, while the legions of Death and Pain and Despair, and all the servile captains of tyrant Fate, afford the burghers of that dauntless city new spectacles of beauty. Happy those sacred ramparts, thrice happy the dwellers on that all-seeing eminence. Honour to those brave warriors who, through countless ages of warfare, have preserved for us the priceless heritage of liberty, and have kept undefiled by sacrilegious invaders the home of the unsubdued.","[F]or all refutation must begin with some piece of knowledge which the disputants share; from blank doubt, no argument can begin.","It is hard to fight with one\u2019s heart\u2019s desire. Whatever it wishes to get, it purchases at the cost of soul.","A great deal of our modern trouble has come from mixing up romantic love, which is a poetic and anarchic impulse, with marriage, which is a social institution.","A fanatical belief in democracy makes democratic institutions impossible","\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u062d\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0639 \u0628\u0639\u0636\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0645\u0628\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0646\u0628\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0638\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u0629.","One obvious palliative of the evils of democracy in its present form would be to encourage much more publicity and initiative on the part of civil servants. They ought to have the right, and, on occasion, the duty, to frame Bills in their own names, and set forth publicly the arguments in their favor.","Is \\"consciousness\\" ultimate and simple, something to be merely accepted and contemplated? Or is it something complex, perhaps consisting in our way of behaving in the presence of objects, or, alternatively, in the existence in us of things called \\"ideas,\\" having a certain relation to objects, though different from them, and only symbolically representative of them?","In a wise community a wise man would not seem foolish!","There are two motives for reading a book: one, that you enjoy it; the other, that you can boast about it.","The conception of duty, speaking historically, has been a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for the interests of their masters rather than for their own. Of course the holders of power conceal this fact from themselves by managing to believe that their interests are identical with the larger interests of humanity. Sometimes this is true; Athenian slave owners, for instance, employed part of their leisure in making a permanent contribution to civilization which would have been impossible under a just economic system. Leisure is essential to civilization, and in former times leisure for the few was only rendered possible by the labors of the many. But their labors were valuable, not because work is good, but because leisure is good. And","Culturally, however, Sicily had great advantages. Muslim, Byzantine, Italian, and German civilization met and mingled there as nowhere else. Greek and Arabic were still living languages in Sicily. Frederick learnt to speak six languages fluently, and in all six he was witty. He was at home in Arabian philosophy, and had friendly relations with Mohammedans, which scandalized pious Christians. He was a Hohenstaufen, and in Germany could count as a German. But in culture and sentiment he was Italian, with a tincture of Byzantine and Arab. His contemporaries gazed upon him with astonishment gradually turning into horror; they called him \u2018wonder of the world and marvellous innovator\u2019.","Religious toleration, to a certain extent, has been won, because people have ceased to consider religion so important as it was once thought to be. But in politics and economics, which have taken the place formerly occupied by religion, there is a growing tendency to persecution, which is not by any means confined to one party.","What makes a freethinker is not his beliefs but the way in which he holds them. If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought he finds a balance of evidence in their favor, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem.","The heterosexual emotions of young children can find a natural, wholesome and innocent outlet with other children; in this form they are a part of play, and like all play, they afford a preparation for adult activities.","Russell observes that \\"the merits of democracy are negative: it does not ensure good government, but it prevents certain evils,\\" such as the evil of a small group of individuals achieving a secure monopoly on political power. The chief peril for the politician, Russell insists, is love of power. And politicians can easily yield to the love of power on the pretense that they are pursuing some absolute good.","There is another more psychological obstacle to the full development of love in the modern world, and that is the fear that many people feel of not preserving their individuality in tact. This is a foolish and rather modern terror. Individuality is not an end in itself; it is something that must enter into fructifying contact with the world, and in so doing must lose its separateness. An individuality which is kept in a glass case withers, whereas on e that is freely expended in human contacts becomes enriched.","The battle must be fought exactly as the battle of religious toleration was fought. And as in that case, so in this, a decay in the intensity of belief is likely to prove the decisive factor. While men were convinced of the absolute truth of Catholicism or Protestantism, as the case may be, they were willing to persecute on account of them. While men are quite certain of their modern creeds, they will persecute on their behalf. Some element of doubt is essential to the practice, thought not to the theory, of toleration.","\u0648\u0642\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0647\u0627\u062a \u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062a\u06a9\u0628 \u0634\u062f\u060c \u0686\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0642\u062f\u06cc\u0645\u06cc \u0647\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u062a\u06a9\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u062f","And if happiness were common, it would preserve itself, because appeals to hatred and fear, which now constitute almost the whole of politics would fall flat.","Philosophy which does not seek to impose upon the world its own conceptions of good and evil is not only more likely to achieve truth, but is also the outcome of a higher ethical standpoint than one which, like evolutionism and most traditional systems, is perpetually appraising the universe and seeking to find in it an embodiment of present ideals.","I was made to learn Latin and Greek, but I resented it, being of opinion that it was silly to learn a language that was no longer spoken.

But when he says this he does not mean by \u2018the real\u2019 what an empiricist would mean. He admits, and even urges, that what to the empiricist appear to be facts are, and must be, irrational; it is only after their apparent character has been transformed by viewing them as aspects of the whole that they are seen to be rational. Nevertheless, the identification of the real and the rational leads unavoidably to some of the complacency inseparable from the belief that \u2018whatever is, is right\u2019.","think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contained, I stand and look at them long and long.

First we say: \u2018Reality is an uncle.\u2019 This is the thesis. But the existence of an uncle implies that of a nephew. Since nothing really exists except the Absolute, and we are now committed to the existence of a nephew, we must conclude: \u2018The Absolute is a nephew.\u2019 This is the antithesis. But there is the same objection to this as to the view that the Absolute is an uncle; therefore we are driven to the view that the Absolute is the whole composed of uncle and nephew. This is the synthesis. But this synthesis is still unsatisfactory, because a man can be an uncle only if he has a brother or sister who is a parent of the nephew. Hence we are driven to enlarge our universe to include the brother or sister, with his wife or her husband.","When a man tells you he knows the exact truth about anything, you are safe in inferring he is an inexact man.","Altogether it will be found that a quiet life is characteristic of great men, and that their pleasures have not been of he sort that would look exciting to the utward eye.

Like any other privileged caste, they use their power for their own advantage. They are, however, in one respect worse than any other privileged caste, since it is their business to expound an unchanging truth, revealed once for all in utter perfection, so that they become necessarily opponents of all intellectual and moral progress.","All the labours of ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noon-day brightness of human genius, are destined to extinciton in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man\'s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins.","But without going to such extremes prudence may easily involve the loss of some of the best things in life. The worshipper of Dionysus reacts against prudence. In intoxication, physical or spiritual, he recovers an intensity of feeling which prudence had destroyed; he finds the world full of delight and beauty, and his imagination is suddenly liberated from the prison of every-day preoccupations.","The world of being is unchangeable, rigid, exact, delightful to the mathematician, the logician, the builder of metaphysical systems, and all who love perfection more than life. The world of existence is fleeting, vague, without sharp boundaries, without any clear plan or arrangement, but it contains all thoughts and feelings, all the data of sense, and all physical objects, everything that can do either good or harm, everything that makes any difference to the value of life and the world. According to our temperaments, we shall prefer the contemplation of the one or of the other.","To understand an age or a nation, we must understand its philosophy, and to understand its philosophy we must ourselves be in some degree philosophers. There is here a reciprocal causation: the circumstances of men\u2019s lives do much to determine their philosophy, but, conversely, their philosophy does much to determine their circumstances.","We think too much of production, and too little of consumption. One result is that we attach too little importance to enjoyment and simple happiness, and that we do not judge production by the pleasure that it gives to the consumer.","Whatever can be thought of is an idea in the mind of the person thinking of it; therefore nothing can be thought of except ideas in minds; therefore anything else is inconceivable, and what is inconceivable cannot exist.","This political disorder found expression in Machiavelli Prince. In the absence of any guiding principle, politics becomes a naked struggle for power; The Prince gives shrewd advice as to how to play this game successfully. What had happened in the great age of Greece happened again in Renaissance Italy: traditional moral restraints disappeared, because they were seen to be associated with superstition; the liberation from fetters made individuals energetic and creative, producing a rare florescence of genius; but the anarchy and treachery which inevitably resulted from the decay of morals made Italians collectively impotent, and they fell, like the Greeks, under the domination of nations less civilized than themselves but not so destitute of social cohesion.","\u0623\u064a\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u0629 \u064a\u064f\u0636\u0639\u0641 \u0645\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0648\u0629 \u062a\u0642\u0628\u0651\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0645","Most people learn nothing from experience, except confirmation of their prejudices.","Any of us confronted by a forgotten letter written some years ago will be astonished to find how much more foolish our opinions were than we had remembered them as being.","Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them.","There are 2 motives for reading a book; 1.

They felt that what was paid out of the poor rate was charity, and therefore a proof of their benevolence; at the same time, wages were kept at starvation level by a method which just prevented discontent from developing into revolution...It was plainly the certainty, derived from the old Poor Law, that actual death would be averted by the parish authorities, which induced the rural poor of England to endure their misery patiently...it taught them respect for their \'betters\'.While leaving all the wealth that they produced, beyond the absolute minimum required for subsistence, in the hands of the landowners and farmers. It was at this period that landowners built the sham Gothic ruins called \'follies\', where they indulged in romantic sensibility about the past while they filled the present with misery and degradation.","It was so obvious to him that war between nation states was unnecessary, and therefore deeply stupid, that he found it hard to believe that anything could explain it other than a passion for destruction and a desire by the combatants to inflict suffering on others at no matter what price in suffering for themselves.","Since all terms that are defined are defined by means of other terms, it is clear that human knowledge must always be content to accept some terms as intelligible without definition, in order to have a starting point for its definitions...[and] since human powers are finite, the definitions known to us must always begin somewhere, with terms undefined for the moment, though perhaps not permanently.\\" - Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy","Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews had no part in the culture of Christian countries, and were too severely persecuted to be able to make contributions to civilization, beyond supplying capital for the building of cathedrals and such enterprises. It was only among the Mohammedans, at that period, that Jews were treated humanely, and were able to pursue philosophy and enlightened speculation. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Mohammedans were more civilized and more humane than the Christians. Christians persecuted Jews, especially at times of religious excitement; the Crusades were associated with appalling pogroms. In Mohammedan countries, on the contrary, Jews at most times were not in any way ill treated. Especially in Moorish Spain, they contributed to learning; Maimonides (1135\u20131204), who was born at Cordova, is regarded by some as the source of much of Spinoza\u2019sphilosophy.Mohammedan civilization in its great days was admirable in the arts and in many technical ways, but it showed no capacity for independent speculation in theoretical matters. Its importance, which must not be under-rated, is as a transmitter. Between ancient and modern European civilization, the dark ages intervened. The Mohammedans and the Byzantines, while lacking the intellectual energy required for innovation, preserved the apparatus of civilization\u2014education, books, and learned leisure. Both stimulated the West when it emerged from barbarism\u2014the Mohammedans chiefly in the thirteenth century, the Byzantines chiefly in the fifteenth.","Fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.Bertrand Russell","Where there is evidence , no one speaks of \\" faith \\" . We do not speak of faith that two and two are four or that the earth is round . We only speak of faith when we wish to substitute emotion for evidence .","Pure mathematics consists entirely of asseverations to the extent that, if such and such a proposition is true of anything, then such and such another proposition is true of anything. It is essential not to discuss whether the first proposition is really true, and not to mention what the anything is, of which it is supposed to be true ... If our hypothesis is about anything, and not about some one or more particular things, then our deductions constitute mathematics. Thus mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.","The world at present is full of angry self-centred groups, each incapable of viewing human life as a whole, each willing to destroy civilization rather than yield an inch","Wealth can often purchase not only the semblance of love but its reality.

Any passion is to him a form of intoxication, and since he cannot conceive of fundamental happiness, all relief from pain appears to him solely possible in the form of intoxication. This, however, is the symptom of a deep-seated malady. Where there is no such malady, the greatest happiness comes with the most complete possession of one\u2019s faculties.","Marriage, and all such close relations, have quite infinite possibilities of pain; nevertheless, I believe it is good to be brought into close contact with people. Otherwise, one remains ignorant of much that it is good to know, merely because it is in the world, and because it increases human comradeship to suffer what others suffer. But it is hard not to long, in weak moments, for a simple life, a life with books and things, away from human sorrow. I am amazed at the number of people who are wretched almost beyond endurance. \'Truly the food man feeds upon is Pain.\' One has to learn to regard happiness, for others as well as for oneself, as more or less unimportant - but though I keep on telling myself this, I do not yet fully and instinctively believe it.","You find this curious fact, that the more intense has been the religion of any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs.","The deeply irrational attitude of each sex toward women may be seen in novels, particularly in bad novels. In bad novels by men, there is the woman with whom the author is in love, who usually possesses every charm, but is somewhat helpless, and requires male protection; sometimes, however, like Shakespeare\u2019s Cleopatra, she is an object of exasperated hatred, and is thought to be deeply and desperately wicked. In portraying the heroine, the male author does not write from observation, but merely objectifies his own emotions. In regard to his other female characters, he is more objective, and may even depend upon his notebook; but when he is in love, his passion makes a mist between him and the object of his devotion. Women novelists, also, have two kinds of women in their books. One is themselves, glamorous and kind, and object of lust to the wicked and of love to the good, sensitive, highsouled, and constantly misjudged. The other kind is represented by all other women, and is usually portrayed as petty, spiteful, cruel, and deceitful. It would seem that to judge women without bias is not easy either for men or for women.","But what the typical modern man desires to get with it is more money, with a view to ostentation, splendour, and the outshining of those who have hitherto been his equals. The social scale in America is indefinite and continually fluctuating. Consequently all the snobbish emotions become more restless than they are where the social order is fixed, and although money in itself may not suffice to make people grand, it is difficult to be grand without money.","The man who is respected merely for being the son of his father loses one of the normal incentives to useful effort. He is likely to develop views of life which attach undue importance to the accident of birth and to think that by merely existing he does enough to command respect. He believes himself rather better than other men and therefore becomes rather worse. All distinctions not based upon intrinsic merit have this bad effect upon character and on this ground, if on no other, deserve to be abolished,","I think I shall have to avoid growing intimate with people I don\'t respect, or trying to help them: it seems to be a job for which I am not fitted.","The principle that we ought to obey God rather than man has been interpreted by Christians in two different ways. God\'s commands may be conveyed to the individual conscience either directly, or indirectly through the medium of the Church. No one except Henry VIII and Hegel has ever held, until our own day, that they could be conveyed through the medium of the State.","Consider again the change in lower middle-class life. In old days, after supper, when the wife and daughters had cleared away the things, everybody sat round and had what was called \u2018a happy family time\u2019. This meant that paterfamilias went to sleep, his wife knitted, and the daughters wished they were dead or at Timbuktu. They were not allowed to read, or to leave the room, because the theory was that at that period their father conversed with them, which must be a pleasure to all concerned. With luck they ultimately married and had a chance to inflict upon their children a youth as dismal as their own had been.

Our political and social thinking is prone to what may be called the \u2018administrator\u2019s fallacy\u2019, by which I mean the habit of looking upon a society as a systematic whole, of a sort that is thought good if it is pleasant to contemplate as a model of order, a planned organism with parts neatly dove-tailed into each other. But a society does not, or at least should not, exist to satisfy an external survey, but to bring a good life to the individuals who compose it. It is in the individuals, not in the whole, that ultimate value is to be sought. A good society is a means to a good life for those who compose it, not something having a separate kind of excellence on its own account.","Love of England is very nearly the strongest emotion that I possess.","The conception of duty has been a means used by the holders of power to induceothers to live for the interests of their masters rather than for theirown.","\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0630\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628 \u0647\u0648 \u063a\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0623\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0630\u0631 \u0641\u062a\u0643\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0629.","\u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u063a\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0634\u062f\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062b\u0642\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u0634\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0642\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627\u060c \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0641\u062a\u0645\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0643\u0648\u0643.","\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0641 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u0644\u062e\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0648\u0623\u062d\u062f \u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633\u0648\u0629\u060c \u0644\u0630\u0627 \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0641 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0629.","The decay of the family in quite recent times is undoubtedly to be attributed in the main to the industrial revolution, but it had already begun before that event, and its beginnings were inspired by individualistic theory. Young","Time makes a man afraid, and fear makes him conciliatory, and being conciliatory he endeavours to appear to others what they will think mellow. And with fear comes the need of affection, of some human warmth to keep away the chill of the cold universe. When I speak of fear, I do not mean merely or mainly personal fear; the fear of death or decrepitude or penury or any such merely mundane misfortune. I am thinking of a more metaphysical fear. I am thinking of the fear that enters the soul through experience of the major evils to which life is subject: the treachery of friends, the death of those whom we love, the discovery of the cruelty that lurks in average human nature.","\u0625\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0643 \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0623\u0647\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0629.","In adolescence, I hated life and was continually on the verge of suicide, from which, however, I was restrained by the desire to know more mathematics. Now, on the contrary, I enjoy life; I might almost say that with every year that passes I enjoy it more\u2026very largely it is due to a diminishing preoccupation with myself. Like others who had a Puritan education, I had the habit of meditating on my sins, follies, and shortcomings. I seemed to myself - no doubt justly - a miserable specimen. Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to center my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection\u2026And every external interest inspires some activity which, so long as the interest remains alive, is a complete preventive of ennui. Interest in oneself, on the contrary, leads to no activity of a progressive kind. It may lead to the keeping of a diary, to getting psychoanalyzed, or perhaps to becoming a monk. But the monk will not be happy until the routine of the monastery has made him forget his own soul. The happiness which he attributes to religion he could have obtained from becoming a crossing-sweeper, provided he were compelled to remain one. External discipline is the only road to happiness for those unfortunates whose self-absorption is too profound to be cured in any other way.","Each of us is in the world for no very long time, and within the few years of his life has to acquire whatever he is to know of this strange planet and its place in the universe. To ignore our opportunities for knowledge, imperfect as they are, is like going to the theater and not listening to the play. The world is full of things that are tragic or comic, heroic or bizarre or surprising, and those who fail to be interested in the spectacle that it offers are forgoing one of the privileges that life has to offer.","You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in humane feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races, or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the world. I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.","One of the commonest things to do with savings is to lend them to some Government.

The man capable of greatness of soul will open wide the windows of his mind, letting the winds blow freely upon it from every portion of the universe. He will see himself and life and the world as truly as our human limitations will permit; realizing the brevity and minuteness of human life, he will realize also that in individual minds is concentrated whatever of value the known universe contains. And he will see that the man whose mind mirrors the world becomes in a sense as great as the world. In emancipation from the fears that beset the slave of circumstance he will experience a profound joy, and through all the vicissitudes of his outward life he will remain in the depths of his being a happy man.","A mind perpetually open, will be a mind perpetually vacant.","In various ways, methods of approaching the mathematician\'s ideal were sought, and the resulting suggestions were the source of much that was mistaken in metaphysics and theory of knowledge.","\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0647\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u0628\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0638\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0641\u0639\u0644\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0645\u064a\u0629.","Something of the same strain and anguish seems to have entered the soul of ivilised man.

The best cure is to have not only one picture, but a whole gallery, and to select the one appropriate to the incident in question. If some of the portraits are a trifle laughable, so much the better; it is not wise to see oneself all day long as a hero of high tragedy. I do not suggest that one should see oneself always as a clown in comedy, for those who d this are even more irritating; a little tact is required in choosing a role appropriate to the situation. Of course, if you can forget yourself and not play a part at all, that is admirable. But if playing a part has become second nature, consider that you act in repertory, and so avoid monotony.","To be out of harmony with one\u2019s surroundings is of course a misfortune, but it is not always a misfortune to be avoided at all costs.

We conceive them abstractly, and deceive ourselves into the belief that acts which are really embodiments of hatred are done from love of justice or some such lofty motive. Only a large measure of scepticism can tear away the veils which hide this truth from us. Having achieved that, we could begin to build a new morality, not based on envy and restriction, but on the wish for a full life and the realization that other human beings are a help and not a hindrance when once the madness of envy has been cured. This is not a Utopian hope; it was partially realized in Elizabethan England. It could be realized tomorrow if men would learn to pursue their own happiness rather than the misery of others. This is no impossibly austere morality, yet its adoption would turn our earth into a paradise.","The human animal, like others, is adapted to a certain amount of struggle for life, and when by means of great wealth homo sapiens can gratify all his whims without effort, the mere absence of effort from his life removes an essential ingredient of happiness. The man who acquires easily things for which he feels only a very moderate desire concludes that the attainment of desire does not bring happiness. If he is of a philosophic disposition, he concludes that human life is essentially wretched, since the man who has all he wants is still unhappy. He forgets that to be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.","It is therefore important to discover whether there is any answer to Hume within the framework of a philosophy that is wholly or mainly empirical.

If revolutionary France could have conquered the Continent and Great Britain, the world would now\xa0be happier, more civilized, and more free, as well as more peaceful. But revolutionary France was a quite exceptional case, because its early conquests were made in the name of liberty, against tyrants, not against peoples; and everywhere the French armies were welcomed as liberators by all except rulers and bigots.","Man is a credulous animal, and must believe something; in the absence of good grounds for belief, he will be satisfied with bad ones.

Where there is no such fundamental reason for acquiescence, the assertions of authority are viewed with cynical scepticism. One of the advantages of democracy, from the governmental point of view, is that it makes the average citizen easier to deceive, since he regards the government as his government.","It is interesting to observe what the Cynic teaching became when it was popularized. In the early part of the third century B.C., the cynics were the fashion, especially in Alexandria. They published little sermons pointing out how easy it is to do without material possessions,","In former times, military power was isolated, with the consequence that victory or defeat appeared to depend upon the accidental qualities of commanders. In our day, it is common to treat economic power as the source from which all other kinds are derived; this, I shall contend, is just as great an error as that of the purely military historians whom it has caused to seem out of date. Again, there are those who regard propaganda as the fundamental form of power.

Roman armies, Roman roads, Roman law, and Roman officials first created and then preserved a powerful centralized State. Nothing was attributable to Roman philosophy, since there was none.","One of the chief obstacles to intelligence is credulity, and credulity could be enormously diminished by instruction as to the prevalent forms of mendacity. Credulity is a greater evil in the present day than it ever was before, because, owing to the growth of education, it is much easier than it used to be to spread misinformation, and, owing to democracy, the spread of misinformation is more important than in former times to the holders of power.","In our age, mankind collectively has given itself over to a degree of hubris surpassing everything known in former ages.","I never found that love, either when it prospered or when it did not, interfered in the slightest with my intellectual concentration.","The only cure [for envy] in the case of ordinary men and women is happiness, and the difficulty is that envy is itself a terrible obstacle to happiness","If, at the end of the war, the scientific organization, which had been created in order to liberate men for fighting and munition work, had been preserved, and the hours of work had been cut down to four, all would have been well. Instead of that the old chaos was restored, those whose work was demanded were made to work long hours, and the rest were left to starve as unemployed. Why? Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in proportion to what he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as exemplified by his industry.","There may be reasons for allowing a man whose work is exceptionally fruitful\u2014for instance, an inventor\u2014to enjoy a larger income than is enjoyed by the average citizen, but therecan be no good reason for allowing this privilege to descend to his children and grandchildren and so on for ever. The effect is to produce an idle and exceptionally fortunate class, who are influential through their money, and opposed to reform for fear it should be directed against themselves. Their whole habit of thought becomes timid, since they dread being forced to acknowledge that their position is indefensible; yet snobbery and the wish to secure their favor leads almost the whole middle-class to ape their manners and adopt their opinions. In this way they become a poison infecting the outlook of almost all educated people.","The war showed conclusively that, by the scientific organization of production, it is possible to keep modern populations in fair comfort on a small part of the working capacity of the modern world.","What you say about changing one\'s self denial is only too true and terrible - it went to my heart - one does form a habit, and then it is no bother.","Tarihsel bak\u0131mdan konu\u015fursak,g\xf6rev kavram\u0131,iktidar sahipleri taraf\u0131ndan ba\u015fkalar\u0131na kendi \xe7\u0131karlar\u0131ndan \xe7ok efendilerinin \xe7\u0131kar\u0131 i\xe7in ya\u015famalar\u0131 gerekti\u011fi d\xfc\u015f\xfcncesini a\u015f\u0131lamakta bir ara\xe7 olarak kullan\u0131lm\u0131\u015ft\u0131r.Do\u011fall\u0131kla, iktidar sahipleri, kendi \xe7\u0131karlar\u0131n\u0131n , insanl\u0131\u011f\u0131n daha geni\u015f \xe7aptaki \xe7\u0131karlar\u0131yla \xf6zde\u015f oldu\u011funa kendi kendilerine inand\u0131rarak, bu olguyu yine kendi kendilerinden saklamaktad\u0131rlar.","I have spoken hitherto of those who command and those who obey, but there is a third type, namely, those who withdraw.

And in the modern world generally, it is the decay of life which has promoted the religion of material goods; and the religion of material goods, in its turn, has hastened the decay of life on which it thrives. The man who worships money has ceased to hope for happiness through his own efforts or in his own activities: he looks upon happiness as a passive enjoyment of pleasures derived from the outside world.","The conception of duty, speaking historically, has been a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for the interests of their masters rather than for their own.","In the Second World War he took no public part, having escaped to a neutral country just before its outbreak. In private conversation he was wont to say that homicidal lunatics were well employed in killing each other, but that sensible men would keep out of their way while they were doing it. Fortunately this outlook, which is reminiscent of Bentham, has become rare in this age, which recognizes that heroism has a value independent of its utility. The Last Survivor of a Dead Epoch","The chief difficulty in regard to knowledge does not arise over derivative knowledge, but over intuitive knowledge. So long as we are dealing with derivative knowledge, we have the test of intuitive knowledge to fall back upon. But in regard to intuitive beliefs, it is by no means easy to discover any criterion by which to distinguish some as true and others as erroneous. In this question it is scarcely possible to reach any very precise result: all our knowledge of truths is infected with some degree of doubt, and a theory which ignored this fact would be plainly wrong.","Clarity, above all, has been my aim.","we have an impulse to inflict pain upon those whom we hate; we therefore believe that they are wicked, and that punishment will reform them. This belief enables us to act upon the impulse to inflict pain, while believing that we are acting upon the desire to lead sinners to repentance. It is for this reason that the criminal law has been in all ages more severe than it would have been if the impulse to ameliorate the criminal had been what really inspired it.","\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062c\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0634\u064a\u0621 .. \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0641\u062a\u0623\u0643\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0643 \u0645\u062e\u0637\u0649\u0621 \u0641\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0646 , \u0644\u0630\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0646\u0642 \u0643\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0645\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0643","The opinions which are still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them. But this is exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the Inquisition.","While economic motives contributed greatly to the spread of the Reformation, they are obviously not sufficient to account for it, since they had been operative for centuries. Many Emperors tried to resist the Pope; so did sovereigns elsewhere, e.g. Henry II and King John in England. But their attempts were thought wicked, and therefore failed. It was only after the Papacy had, for a long time, so abused its traditional powers as to cause a moral revolt, that successful resistance became possible.","London is a weary place, where it is quite impossible to think or feel anything worthy of a human being - I feel horribly lost here.

All such optimisms seem to me dangerous to civilisation, and the outcome of a heart not yet sufficiently mortified.","Religious toleration, to a certain extent, has been wonbecause people have ceased to consider religion so importantas it was once thought to be. But in politics and economics,which have taken the place formerly occupied by religion,there is a growing tendency to persecution, which is not byany means confined to one party. The persecution of opinion in Russia is more severe than in any capitalist country. I metin Petrograd an eminent Russian poet, Alexander Block,who has since died as the result of privations. The Bolsheviksallowed him to teach aesthetics, but he complained that theyinsisted on his teaching the subject \u201cfrom a Marxian pointof view. He had been at a loss to discover how the theory ofrhythmics was connected with Marxism, although, to avoidstarvation, he had done his best to find out..The examples of America and Russia illustrate theconclusion to which we seem to be driven \u2014 namely, that so long as men continue to have the present fanatical belief inthe importance of politics free thought on political matterswill be impossible, and there is only too much danger that thelack of freedom will spread to all other matters, as it has donein Russia. Only some degree of political skepticism can saveus from this misfortune.\u201d","temptation to be interesting rather than technically effective is a dangerous one.","The Roman soldier who killed Archimedes was a symbol of the death of original thought that Rome caused throughout the Hellenic world.","Those who have studied the working of the American Constitution know that the Supreme Court is part of the forces engaged in the protection of the plutocracy. But of the men who know this, some are on the side of the plutocracy, and therefore do nothing to weaken the traditional reverence for the Supreme Court, while others are discredited in the eyes of ordinary quiet citizens by being said to be subversive and Bolshevik. A considerable further career of obvious partisanship will be necessary before a Luther will be able to attack successfully the authority of the official interpreters of the Constitution.","The tragedy of one successful politician after another is the gradual substitution of narcissism for an interest in the community and the measures for which he stands.","Os conceitos da vida e do mundo que chamamos \\"filos\xf3ficos\\" s\xe3o produto de dois fatores: um, constitu\xeddo de fatores religiosos e \xe9ticos herdados; o outro, pela esp\xe9cie de investiga\xe7\xe3o que podemos denominar \\"cient\xedfica\\", empregando a palavra em seu sentido mais amplo.","What is the difference between \u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018opinion\u2019? The man who has knowledge has knowledge of something, that is to say, of something that exists, for what does not exist is nothing. (This is reminiscent of Parmenides.) Thus knowledge is infallible, since it is logically impossible for it to be mistaken. But opinion can be mistaken. How can this be? Opinion cannot be of what is not, for that is impossible; nor of what is, for then it would be knowledge. Therefore opinion must be of what both is and is not.","Perfect rationality consists, not in believing what is true, but in attaching to every proposition a degree of belief corresponding to its degree of credibility.","Assim, para recapitular a nossa discuss\xe3o do valor da filosofia: a filosofia \xe9 de estudar n\xe3o por causa de quaisquer respostas definitivas \xe0s suas quest\xf5es, dado que nenhumas respostas definitivas podem, em regra, ser conhecidas como verdadeiras, mas antes por causa das pr\xf3prias quest\xf5es; porque estas quest\xf5es alargam a nossa concep\xe7\xe3o do que \xe9 poss\xedvel, enriquecem a nossa imagina\xe7\xe3o intelectual e diminuem a confian\xe7a dogm\xe1tica que fecham a mente contra a especula\xe7\xe3o; mas acima de tudo porque, atrav\xe9s da grandeza do universo que a filosofia contempla, a mente tamb\xe9m se torna grandiosa, e torna-se capaz dessa uni\xe3o com o universo que constitui o seu bem maior.","One man likes oysters, and another likes pineapples; this distinguishes between them. But when they think about the multiplication table, provided they think correctly, there is no difference between them. The irrational separates us, the rational unites us.","Undoubtedly the most important source of religion is fear; this can be seen in the present day, since anything that causes alarm is apt to turn people\'s thoughts to God. Battle, pestilence, and shipwreck all tend to make people religious.","But the modern man, when misfortune assails him, is conscious of himself as a unit in a statistical total; the past and the future stretch before him in a dreary procession of trivial defeats. Man himself appears as a somewhat ridiculous strutting animal, shouting and fussing during a brief interlude between infinite silences.","...what is the use of making everybody rich if the rich themselves are miserable?","The problem of the social reformer, therefore, is not merely to seek means of security, for if these means when found provide no deep satisfaction the security will be thrown away for the glory of adventure.","A todos los j\xf3venes con talento que van por ah\xed convencidos de que no tienen nada que hacer en el mundo, yo les dir\xeda: \xabDeja de intentar escribir y en cambio intenta no escribir.

It is amusing to hear the modern Christian telling you how mild and rationalistic Christianity really is and ignoring the fact that all its mildness and rationalism is due to the teaching of men who in their own day were persecuted by all orthodox Christians.","If one has instinctive sympathy, one comes to know the true history of a certain number of people and from that one can more or less create one\'s world. But to plunge into life oneself takes a great deal of time and energy, and is, for most people, incompatible with preserving the attitude of a spectator, One needs, as the key to interpret alien experience, a personal knowledge of great unhappiness; but that is a thing which one need hardly set forth to seek, for it comes unasked. When once one possesses this key, the strange, tragic phantasmagoria of people hoping, suffering, and then dying, begins to suffice without one\'s desiring to take part, except occasionally to speak a word of encouragement where it is possible","The Chinese nation is the most patient in the world; it thinks of centuries as other nations think of decades. It is essentially indestructible, and can afford to wait. The \\"civilized\\" nations of the world, with their blockades their poison gases, their bombs submarines and negro armies, will probably destroy each other within the next three hundred years, leaving the stage to those whose pacifism has kept them alive, though poor and powerless. If China can avoid being goaded into war, her oppressors may wear themselves out in the end, and leave the Chinese free to pursue humane ends, instead of war and rapine and destruction which all white nations love.","Eton and Oxford set a certain stamp upon a man\u2019s mind, just as a Jesuit College does. It can hardly be said that Eton and Oxford have a\xa0conscious\xa0purpose, but they have a purpose which is none the less strong and effective for not being formulated. In almost all who have been through them they produce a worship of \u201cgood form, which is as destructive to life and thought as the medieval Church. \u201cGood form\u201d is quite compatiblewith a superficial open-mindedness, a readiness to hear all sides, and a certain urbanity towards opponents. But it is not compatible with fundamental open-mindedness, or with any inward readiness to give weight to the other side. Its essence is the assumption that what is most important is a certain kind of behavior, a behavior which minimizes friction between equals and delicately impresses inferiors with a conviction of their own crudity.\u201d","Most modern people think of religion as a consolation, but to Epicurus it was the opposite. Supernatural interference with the course of nature seemed to him a source of terror, and immortality fatal to the hope of release from pain. Accordingly he constructed an elaborate doctrine designed to cure men of the beliefs that inspire fear.","The civilized man is distinguished from the savage mainly by prudence, or, to use a slightly wider term, forethought. He is willing to endure present pains for the sake of future pleasures, even if the future pleasures are rather distant. This habit began to be important with the rise of agriculture; no animal and no savage would work in the spring in order to have food next winter, except for a few purely instinctive forms of action, such as bees making honey or squirrels burying nuts. In these cases, there is no forethought; there is a direct impulse to an act which, to the human spectator, is obviously going to prove useful later on. True forethought only arises when a man does something towards which no impulse urges him, because his reason tells him that he will profit by it at some future date. Hunting requires no forethought, because it is pleasurable; but tilling the soil is labour, and cannot be done from spontaneous impulse. Civilization checks impulse not only through forethought, which is a self-administered check, but also through law, custom, and religion. This check it inherits from barbarism, but it makes it less instinctive and more systematic. Certain acts are labelled criminal, and are punished; certain others, though not punished by law, are labelled wicked, and expose those who are guilty of them to social disapproval. The institution of private property brings with it the subjection of women, and usually the creation of a slave class. On the one hand the purposes of the community are enforced upon the individual, and, on the other hand the individual, having acquired the habit of viewing his life as a whole, increasingly sacrifices his present to his future. It is evident that this process can be carried too far, as it is, for instance, by the miser. But without going to such extremes, prudence may easily involve the loss of some of the best things in life.","The young are taught a sort of copybook account of how public affairs are supposed to be conducted, and are carefully shielded from all knowledge as to how in fact they are conducted. When they grow up and discover the truth, the result is too often a complete cynicism in which all public ideals are lost; whereas if they had been taught the truth carefully and with proper comment at an earlier age they might have become men able to combat evils in which, as it is, they acquiesce with a shrug.","A skilful orator, when he wishes to stimulate warlike feeling, produces in his audience two layers of belief: a superficial layer, in which the power of the enemy is magnified so as to make great courage seem necessary, and a deeper layer, in which there is a firm conviction of victory. Both are embodied in such a slogan as \u2018right will prevail over might\u2019.","We have first to distinguish knowledge of things and knowledge of truths. In each there are two kinds, one immediate and one derivative. Our immediate knowledge of things, which we called acquaintance, consists of two sorts, according as the things known are particulars or universals. Among particulars, we have acquaintance with sense-data and (probably) with ourselves. Among universals, there seems to be no principle by which we can decide which can be known by acquaintance, but it is clear that among those that can be so known are sensible qualities, relations of space and time, similarity, and certain abstract logical universals. Our derivative knowledge of things, which we call knowledge by description, always involves both acquaintance with something and knowledge of truths. Our immediate knowledge of truths may be called intuitive knowledge, and the truths so known may be called self-evident truths. Among such truths are included those which merely state what is given in sense, and also certain abstract logical and arithmetical principles, and (though with less certainty) some ethical propositions. Our derivative knowledge of truths consists of everything that we can deduce from self-evident truths by the use of self-evident principles of deduction.","But self-deception of this kind (ed persecution) cannot lead to any solid happiness. In the back of your mind you will know that the facts are otherwise, and in order to conceal this from yourself as far as possible, you will have to invent more and more fantastic hypotheses. The strain of trying to believe these will, in the end, become very great. And since, moreover, they involve the belief that you are the object of widespread hostility, they will only safeguard your self-esteem by inflicting the very painful feeling that you are at odds with the world. No satisfaction based upon self-deception is solid, and however unpleasant the truth may be, it is better to face it once for all, to get used to it, and to proceed to build your life in accordance with it.","...the work of inspection was left to magistrates and clergymen. To the relief of employers, experience showed that magistrates and clergymen had no objection to law-breaking when its purpose was merely the torture of children.","En a\u015fa\u011f\u0131 tasar\u0131lar\u0131m\u0131z ve yoksullu\u011fumuz kadar,\xe7irkinlikte, bizim \xf6zel giri\u015fim k\xe2r\u0131na k\xf6le olmak i\xe7in \xf6dedi\u011fimiz fiyat\u0131n bir b\xf6l\xfcm\xfcd\xfcr.","It is only those in whom the desire to think truly is itself a passion who will find this desire adequate to control the passions of war. Only passion can control passion, and only a contrary impulse or desire can check impulse. Reason, as it is preached by traditional moralists, is too negative, too little living, to make a good life. It is not by reason alone that wars can be prevented, but by a positive life of impulses and passions antagonistic to those that\xa0lead to war.","The kind of mob that the orator will desire is one more given to emotion than to reflection, one filled with fears and consequent hatreds, one impatient of slow and gradual methods, and at once exasperated and hopeful. The orator, if he is not a complete cynic, will acquire a set of beliefs that justify his activities. He will think that feeling is a better guide than reason, that our opinions should be formed with the blood rather than the brain, that the best elements in human life are collective rather than individual.","It is sometimes said that \'light is a form of wave-motion\', but this is misleading, for the light which we immediately see, which we know directly by means of our senses, is not a form of wave-motion, but something quite different\u2014something which we all know if we are not blind, though we cannot describe it so as to convey our knowledge to a man who is blind. A wave-motion, on the contrary, could quite well be described to a blind man, since he can acquire a knowledge of space by the sense of touch; and he can experience a wave-motion by a sea voyage almost as well as we can. But this, which a blind man can understand, is not what we mean by light: we mean by light just that which a blind man can never understand, and which we can never describe to him.","It has been argued that we have reason to know that the future will resemble the past, because what was the future has constantly become the past, and has always been found to resemble the past, so that we really have experience of the future, namely of times which were formerly future, which we may call past futures.","The beginnings of Algebra I found far more difficult, perhaps as a result of bad teaching, I was made to learn by heart: \'The square of the sum of two numbers is equal to the sum of their squares increased by twice their product.\' I had not the vaguest idea what this meant, and when I could not remember the words, my tutor threw the book at my head, which did not stimulate my intellect in any way.","people, to whom the Eternal is represented by the Monthlies, to which they rise with difficulty from the daily papers, strike me as all puppets, blind embodiments of the forces of nature, never achieving the liberation that comes to man when he ceases to desire and learns at last to contemplate. Only in thought is man a God; in action and desire we are the slaves of circumstance.","It is impossible for technique to remain long progressive without science, or for science to flourish where there is no freedom of thought. Consequently insistence on doctrinal uniformity, even in matters quite remote from war, is ultimately fatal to military efficiency in a scientific age.","Those who have the habit of controlling powerful mechanisms, and through this control have acquired power over human beings, may be expected to have an imaginative outlook towards their subjects which will be completely different from that of men who depend upon persuasion, however dishonest.

One should respect public opinion in so far as necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny, and is likely to interfere with happiness in all kinds of ways. Take, for example, the matter of expenditure. Very many people spend money in ways quite different from those that their natural tastes would enjoin, merely because they feel that the respect of their neighbours depends upon their possession of a good car and their ability to give good dinners. As a matter of fact, any man who can obviously afford a car but genuinely prefers travel or a good library will in the end be much more respected than if he behaved exactly like every one else. There is of course no point in deliberately flouting public opinion; this is still to be under its domination, though in a topsy-turvy way. But to be genuinely indifferent to it is both a strength and a source of happiness. And a society composed of men and women who do not bow too much to the conventions is a far more interesting society than one in which all behave alike. Where each person\u2019s character is developed individually, differences in type are preserved, and it is worth while to meet new people, because they are not mere replicas of those whom one has met already.","Philosophy, as I shall understand the word, is something intermediate between theology and science. Like theology, it consists of speculations on matters as to which definite knowledge has, so far, been unascertainable; but like science, it appeals to human reason rather than to authority, whether that of tradition or that of revelation.","The rulers of the world have always been stupid, but have not in the past been so powerful as they are now. It is therefore more important than it used to be to find some way of securing that they shall be intelligent. Is this problem insoluble? I do not think so, but I should be the last to maintain that it is easy.","Intelligence is impeded by any creed, no matter what, and kindness is inhibited by the belief in sin and punishment (this belief, by the way, is the only one that the Soviet Government has taken over from orthodox Christianity)","We have two kinds of morality side by side: one which we preach but do not practice and another which we practice but seldom preach","The pleasure of work is open to anyone who can develop some specialized skill, provided that he can get satisfaction from the exercise of his skill without demanding universal applause.","at first sight it might be thought that knowledge might be defined as belief which is in agreement with the facts. The trouble is that no one knows what a belief is, no one knows what a fact is, and no one knows what sort of agreement between them would make a belief true.","Bergson, under the name of \u201cintuition, has raised instinct to the position of sole\xa0arbiter of metaphysical truth. But in fact the opposition of instinct and reason is mainly illusory. Instinct, intuition, or insight is what first leads to the beliefs which subsequent reason confirms or confutes; but the confirmation, where it is possible, consists, in the last analysis, of agreement with other beliefs no less instinctive. Reason is a harmonising, controlling force rather than a creative one. Even in the most purely logical realms, it is insight that first arrives at what is new.\u201d","The men who have an important influence in the world, whether for good or evil, are dominated as a rule by a threefold desire: they desire, first, an activity which calls fully into play the faculties in which they feel that they excel; secondly, the sense of successfully overcoming resistance; thirdly, the respect of others on account of their success. The third of these desires is sometimes absent: some men who have been great have been without the \u201clast infirmity, and have been content with their own sense of success, or merely with the joy of difficult effort.\u201d","The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge. Neither love without knowledge, nor knowledge without love can produce a good life.","To all the talented young men who wander about feeling that there is nothing in the world for them to do, I should say: \u201cGive up trying to write, and, instead, try not to write. Go out into the world; become a pirate, a king in Borneo, a laborer in Soviet Russia; give yourself an existence in which the satisfaction of elementary physical needs will occupy almost all your energies.","The more the methods of propaganda have been used to produce excitement, the greater will be the reaction, until in the end a quiet life comes to seem the only thing worth having. When, after a period of repose, the population again becomes capable of excitement, it will need a new stimulus, since all the old stimuli have become boring. Hence creeds which are used too intensively are transitory in their effects. In the thirteenth century, men\'s imaginations were dominated by three great men: the Pope, the Emperor, and the Sultan. The Emperor and the Sultan have disappeared, and the Pope\'s power is a pale shadow of what it was. In the sixteenth and early seventeeth centuries, the wars between Catholics and Protestants filled Europe, and all large-scale propaganda was in favour of one or other of the two creeds. Yet ultimate victory went to neither party, but, to those who thought the issues between them unimportant. Swift satirised the conflict in his wars of Big-Endians and Little-Endians; Voltaire\'s Huron, finding himself in prison with a Jansenist, thinks it equally silly of the government to demand his recantation and of him to refuse it. If the world, in the near future, becomes divided between Communists and Fascists, the final victory will go to neither, but to those who shrug their shoulders and say, like Candide, \u2018cela est bien dit, mais il faut cultiver notre jardin\u2019. The ultimate limit to the power of creeds is set by boredom, weariness, and love of ease.","We may say that thought is free when it is exposed to free competition among beliefs\u2014i.e., when all beliefs are able to state their case, and no legal or pecuniary advantages or disadvantages attach to beliefs. This is an ideal which, for various reasons, can never be fully attained. But it is possible to approach very much nearer to it than we do at present.","The only logical meaning of necessity seems to be derived from implication. A proposition is more or less necessary according as the class of propositions for which it is a premiss is greater or smaller.* In this sense the propositions of logic have the greatest necessity, and those of geometry have a high degree of necessity. But this sense of necessity yields no valid argument from our inability to imagine holes in space to the conclusion that there cannot really be any space at all except in our imaginations.","Whoever wishes to see the world truly, to rise in thought above the tyranny of practical desires, must learn to overcome the difference of attitude towards past and future, and to survey the whole stream of time in one comprehensive vision.","\u0625\u0646 \u0639\u0642\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646\u0641\u062a\u062d\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u060c\u060c \u0647\u0648 \u0639\u0642\u0644 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u063a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0645","There is no ultimate satisfaction in the cultivation of one element of human nature at the expense of all the others, nor in viewing all the world as raw material for the magnificence of one\u2019s own ego.","Memory does not prolong the existence of the past; it is merely one way in which the past has effects.","Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting fairy tales. It is not good either to forget the questions that philosophy asks, or to persuade ourselves that we have found indubitable answers to them. To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralysed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can still do for those who study it.","The goods of the mind are at least as important as the goods of the body.","J\'estime que dans toutes les d\xe9finitions de la vie bienheureuse , il faut faire entrer un instinct d\'animal , sans quoi la vie devient fade et sans int\xe9r\xeat","Every organisation, whatever its character and whatever its purpose, involves some redistribution of power.

Those who use this argument conveniently forget how many once universal beliefs are now discarded.","The free intellect will see as God might see, without a here and now, without hopes and fears, without the trammels of customary beliefs and traditional prejudices, calmly, dispassionately, in the sole and exclusive desire of knowledge\u2014knowledge as impersonal, as purely contemplative, as it is possible for man to attain. Hence also the free intellect will value more the abstract and universal knowledge into which the accidents of private history do not enter, than the knowledge brought by the senses, and dependent, as such knowledge must be, upon an exclusive and personal point of view and a body whose sense-organs distort as much as they reveal.","It is neither intellect nor intuition, but sensation, that supplies new data; but when the data are new in any remarkable manner, intellect is much more capable of dealing with them than intuition would be. The hen with a brood of ducklings no doubt has intuitions which seem to place her inside them, and not merely to know them analytically; but when the ducklings take to the water, the whole apparent intuition is seen to be illusory, and the hen is left helpless on the shore. Intuition, in fact, is an aspect and development of instinct, and, like all instinct, is admirable in those customary surroundings which have moulded the habits of the animal in question, but totally incompetent as soon as the surroundings are changed in a way which demands some non-habitual mode of action.","There is no reason, therefore, so far as I am able to perceive, to deny the ultimate and absolute philosophical validity of a theory of geometry which regards space as composed of points, and not as a mere assemblage of relations between non-spatial terms.","Great Empedocles, that ardent soul, Leapt into Etna, and was roasted whole.","Some of the men to whom Copernicus communicated his theory were German Lutherans, but when Luther came to know of it, he was profoundly shocked. \u2018People give ear,\u2019 he said, \u2018to an upstart astrologer who strove to show that the earth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and the moon. Whoever wishes to appear clever must devise some new system, which of all systems is of course the very best. This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred Scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth.","The technique of acquiring dictatorship over what has been a democracy has been familiar since Greek times, and always involves the same mixture of bribery, propaganda and violence.","The persecution of opinion in Russia is more severe than in any capitalist country. I met in Petrograd an eminent Russian poet, Alexander Block, who has since died as the result of privations. The Bolsheviks allowed him to teach \xe6sthetics, but he complained that they insisted on his teaching the subject \u201cfrom a Marxian point of view. He had been at a loss to discover how the theory of rhythmics was connected with Marxism, although, to avoid starvation, he had done his best to find out. Of course, it has been impossible in Russia ever since the Bolsheviks came into power to print anything critical of the dogmas upon which their regime is founded.\u201d","I do not like mystical language, and yet I hardly know how to express what I mean without employing phrases that sound poetic rather than scientific.","Only the guardians, in Plato\u2019s language, are to think; the rest are to obey, or to follow leaders like a herd of sheep. This doctrine, often unconsciously, has survived the introduction of political democracy, and has radically vitiated all national systems of education.","There is in Descartes an unresolved dualism between what he learnt from contemporary science and the scholasticism that he had been taught at La Fl\xe8che. This led him into inconsistencies, but it also made him more rich in fruitful ideas than any completely logical philosopher could have been. Consistency might have made him merely the founder of a new scholasticism, whereas inconsistency made him the source of two important but divergent schools of philosophy.","We cannot admire a social system which allows no scope for individual achievement, and we cannot approve one in which excessive individualism makes the social system unstable.","Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intelligence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on any subject whatever.","Leibniz used to discourse to Queen Sophia Charlotte of Prussia concerning the infinitely little, and how she would reply that on that subject she needed no instruction\u2014the behaviour of courtiers had made her thoroughly familiar with it.","I am in no degree ashamed of having changed my opinions. What physicist who was actice in 1900 would dream of boasting that his opinions had not changed?",". For example, the art of reading the newspapers should be taught. The schoolmaster should select some incident which happened a good many years ago, and roused political passions in its day. He should then read to the school children what was said by the newspapers on one side, what was said by those on the other, and some impartial account of what really happened. He should show how, from the biased account of either side, a practised reader could infer what really happened, and he should make them understand that everything in newspapers is more or less untrue. The cynical scepticism which would result from this teaching would make the children in later life immune from those appeals to idealism by which decent people are induced to further the schemes of scoundrels.","One comes across white men occasionally who suffer under the delusion that China is not a civilized country. Such men have forgotten what constitutes civilization.","The pursuit of social success, in the form of prestige or power or both, is the most important obstacle in a competitive society.","But in fact, while some aspects of history can be made more or less scientific, and while it is important to do this wherever it is possible, the material is too complex to be reduced to scientific laws at present, and probably for centuries to come.","not because the moral law enjoins unselfishness, but because, given the society in which they live, it is the way in which their impulses and desires prompt them to act. It is clear that better institutions, better education of the emotions, and a better apportioning of praise and blame, would increase the already considerable extent to which people\u2019s actions further the well-being of their community. It is to such causes, rather than to a revived belief in supernatural sanctions, that we must look for ethical progress.","Aristotle does not consider virtue and wealth strictly synonymous. What he holds, in accordance with the doctrine of the golden mean, is that a moderate competence is most likely to be associated with virtue: \u201cMankind do not acquire or preserve virtue by the help of external goods, but external goods by the help of virtue, and happiness, whether consisting in pleasure or virtue, or both, is more often found with those who are most highly cultivated in their mind and in their character, and have only a moderate share of external goods, than among those who possess external goods to a useless extent but are deficient in higher qualities","There is here a reciprocal causation: the circumstances of men\u2019s lives do much to determine their philosophy, but, conversely, their philosophy does much to determine their circumstances. This interaction throughout the centuries will be the topic of the following pages.","The pursuit of social success, in the form of prestige or power or both, is the most important obstacle to happiness in a competitive society.","The mind which has become accustomed to the freedom and impartiality of philosophic contemplation will preserve something of the same freedom and impartiality in the world of action and emotion.","Socrates could enjoy a banquet now and again, and must have derived considerable satisfaction from his conversations while the hemlock was taking effect, but most of his life he lived quietly with Xanthippe, taking a constitutional in the afternoon, and perhaps meeting with a few friends by the way. Kant is said never to have been more than ten miles from Konigsberg in all his life. Darwin, after going round the world, spent the whole rest of his life in his own house. Marx, after stirring up a few revolutions, decided to spend the remainder of his days in the British Museum. Altogether it will be found that a quiet life is characteristic of great men, and that their pleasures have not been of the sort that would look exciting to the outward eye. No great achievement is possible without persistent work, so absorbing and so difficult that little energy is left over for the more strenuous kinds of amusement, except such as serve to recuperate physical energy during holidays, of which Alpine climbing may serve as the best example.","This is one of those views which are so absurd that only very learned men could possibly adopt them.","...nor do I think that my scientific outlook has contributed very greatly to my happiness, which I attribute to defecating twice a day with unfailing regularity.","The essence of nice people is that they hate life as manifested in tendencies to co-operation, in the boisterousness of children, and above all in sex, with the thought of which they are obsessed. In a word, nice people are those who have nasty minds.","Naive realism leads to physics, and physics, if true, shows naive realism to be false. Therefore naive realism, if true, is false; therefore it is false.","It is amazing how much both happiness and efficiency can be increased by the cultivation of an orderly mind, which thinks about a matter adequately at the right time rather than inadequately at all times.","A stupid man\u2019s report of what a clever man says is never accurate, because he unconsciously translates what he hears into something that he can understand. I would rather be reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than by a friend innocent of philosophy.","The belief in a happy \\"state of nature\\" in the remote past is derived partly from the biblical narrative of the age of the patriarchs, partly from the classical myth of the golden age. The general belief in the badness of the remote past only came with the doctrine of evolution.","Physical science, through the medium of inventions, is useful to innumerable people who are wholly ignorant of it; thus the study of physical science is to be recommended, not only, or primarily, because of the effect on the student, but rather because of the effect on mankind in general. Thus utility does not belong to philosophy. If the study of philosophy has any value at all for others than students of philosophy, it must be only indirectly, through its effects upon the lives of those who study it.","Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world needs most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life of arduous struggle. Modern","Protestants, on the contrary, rejected the Church as a vehicle of revelation; truth was to be sought only in the Bible, which each man could interpret for himself. If men differed in their interpretation, there was no divinely appointed authority to decide the dispute. In practice, the State claimed the right that had formerly belonged to the Church, but this was a usurpation. In Protestant theory, there should be no earthly intermediary between the soul and God.","Thus, to sum up our discussion of the value of philosophy; Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes the mind against speculation; but above all because, through the greatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind also is rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe which constitutes its highest good. OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD","Correlative to the impulse of aggression is the impulse of resistance to aggression. This impulse is exemplified in the attitude of the Israelites to the Philistines or of medieval Europe to the Mohammedans. The beliefs which it produces are beliefs in the peculiar wickedness of those whose aggression is feared, and in the immense value of national customs which they might suppress if they were victorious. When the war broke out, all the reactionaries in England and France began to speak of the danger to democracy, although until that moment they had opposed democracy with all their strength. They were not insincere in so speaking: the impulse of resistance to Germany made them value whatever was endangered by the German attack. They loved\xa0democracy because they hated Germany; but they thought they hated Germany because they loved democracy.","The civilized man is distinguished from the savage mainly by prudence, or, to use a slightly wider term, forethought. He is willing to endure present pains for the sake of future pleasures, even if the future pleasures are rather distant.","El impulso natural de la persona vigorosa y decente es tratar de hacer el bien, pero si se ve privada de todo poder pol\xedtico y de toda oportunidad de influir en los acontecimientos, se ver\xe1 desviada de su curso natural, y decidir\xe1 que lo importante es ser bueno. Eso es lo que les ocurri\xf3 a los primeros cristianos; ha conducido a un concepto de santidad personal como algo completamente independiente de la acci\xf3n ben\xe9fica, ya que la santidad ten\xeda que ser algo que pod\xeda ser logrado por personas impotentes en la acci\xf3n. Por lo tanto, la virtud social lleg\xf3 a estar excluida de la \xe9tica cristiana. Hasta hoy los cristianos convencionales piensan que un ad\xfaltero es peor que un pol\xedtico que acepta sobornos, aunque este \xfaltimo probablemente hace un mal mil veces mayor.","In national politics, where you are one of some twenty million voters, your influence is infinitesimal unless you are exceptional or occupy an exceptional position. You have, it is true, a twenty-millionth share in the government of others, but only a twenty-millionth share in the government of yourself. You are therefore much more conscious of being governed than of governing.","Men would be chosen for jobs on account of fitness to do the work, not because they flattered the irrational dogmas of those in power.","to a great extent, the uncertainty of philosophy is more apparent than real: those questions which are already capable of definite answers are placed in the sciences, while those only to which, at present, no definite answer can be given, remain to form the residue which is called philosophy.","If you think that by killing men you can prevent some one from censuring your evil lives, you are mistaken; that is not a way of escape which is either possible or honourable; the easiest and the noblest way is not to be disabling others, but to be improving yourselves.","True forethought only arises when a man does something towards which no impulse urges him, because his reason tells him that he will profit by it at some future date.","In general, if a man says, for instance, that the earth is flat, I am quite willing that he should propagate his opinion as hard as he likes. He may, of course, be right but I do not think he is. In practice you will, I think, do better to assume that the earth is round, although, of course, you may be mistaken. Therefore, I do not think we should go in for complete skepticism, but for a doctrine of degrees of probability.","In this lies Man\'s true freedom: in determination to worship only the God created by our own love of the good.","We still think it natural that a man should leave his property to his children, that is to say we accept the hereditary principle as regards economic power, while rejecting it as regards political power. Political dynasties have disappeared; economic dynasties survive. When you consider how natural it seems to us that the power over the lives of others resulting from great wealth should be hereditary, you will understand better how men like Sir Robert Filmer could take the same view as regards the power of kings.","...untroubled by the thought of death because he fears himself not really separate from those who will come after him. It is in such profound instinctive union with the stream of life the greatest joy is to be found.","Power is naked when its subjects respect it solely because it is power, and not for any other reason. Thus a form of power which has been traditional becomes naked as soon as the tradition ceases to be accepted. It follows that periods of free thought and vigorous criticism tend to develop into periods of naked power.","Those who maintain that mind is the reality and matter an evil dream are called \\"idealists\\"\u2014a word which has a different meaning in philosophy from that which it bears in ordinary life. Those who argue that matter is the reality and mind a mere property of protoplasm are called \\"materialists.","This is the exact opposite of that lazy acquiescence in irrationality which is sometimes urged by those who only know that psychoanalysis has shown the prevalence of irrational beliefs, and who forget or ignore that its purpose is to diminish this prevalence by a definite method of medical treatment. A closely similar method can cure the irrationalities of those who are not recognized lunatics, provided they will submit to treatment by a practitioner free from their delusions. Presidents, Cabinet Ministers, and Eminent Persons, however, seldom fulfil this condition, and therefore remain uncured.","There are three forces on the side of life which require no exceptional mental endowment, which are not very rare at present, and might be very common under better social institutions.\xa0They are love, the instinct of constructiveness, and the joy of life.","The private world of instinctive interests is a small one, set in the midst of a great and powerful world which must, sooner or later, lay our private world in ruins. Unless we can so enlarge our interests as to include the whole outer world, we remain like a garrison in a beleagured fortress, knowing that the enemy prevents escape and that ultimate surrender is inevitable. In such a life there is no peace, but a constant strife between the insistence of desire and the powerlessness of will. In one way or another, if our life is to be great and free, we must escape this prison and this strife.","A word as to the title. In the preface of my Human Knowledge I said that I was writing not only for professional philosophers, and that \'philosophy proper deals with matters of interest to the general educated public.\' Reviewers took me to task, saying they found parts of the book difficult, and implying that my words were such as to mislead purchasers. I do not wish to expose myself again to this charge; I will therefore confess that there are several sentences in the present volume which some unusually stupid children of ten might find a little puzzling. On this ground I do not claim that the essays are popular; and if not popular, then \'unpopular.","I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy, ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of my life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it next, because it relieves loneliness, the terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what, at last, I have found.","Differences between nations, so long as they do not lead to hostility, are by no means to be deplored. Living for a time in a foreign country makes us aware of merits in which our own country is deficient, and this is true whichever country our own may be. The same thing holds of differences between different regions within one country, and of the differing types produced by different professions. Uniformity of character and uniformity of culture are to be regretted. Biological evolution has depended upon inborn differences between individuals or tribes, and cultural evolution depends upon acquired differences. When these disappear, there is no longer any material for selection. In the modern world, there is a real danger of too great similarity between one region and another in cultural respects. One of the best ways of minimising this evil is an increase in the autonomy of different groups.","All joy in true thought is part of the intellectual love of God,","El tiempo que disfrutas perder no es tiempo perdido","Heraclitus believes in war. \u201cWar, he says, \u201cis the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.\u201d","Periods of naked power are usually brief. They end, as a rule, in one or other of three ways. The first is foreign conquest, as in the cases of Greece and Italy which we have already considered. The second is the establishment of a stable dictatorship, which soon becomes traditional; of this the most notable instance is the empire of Augustus, after the period of civil wars from Marius to the defeat of Antony. The third is the rise of a new religion, using the word in its widest sense. Of this, an obvious instance is the way in which Mohammed united the previously warring tribes of Arabia.","Not only teachers, but all commonplace persons in authority,desire in their subordinates that kind of uniformitywhich makes their actions easily predictable and never inconvenient.The result is that they crush initiative and individualitywhen they can, and when they cannot, they quarrel with it.","Throughout Greece, it was useless to object to a politician on the ground that he took bribes from the King of Persia, because his opponents also did so if they became sufficiently powerful to be worth buying. The result was a universal scramble for personal power, conducted by corruption, street fighting, and assassination. In this business, the friends of Socrates and Plato were among the most unscrupulous. The final outcome, as might have been foreseen, was subjugation by foreign Powers.","Atoms, by collision, produce vortices, which generate bodies and ultimately worlds.","It is held that no woman can have a good moral influence unless she is or pretends to be indifferent to the male sex.","While I wanted to think everything false, it must necessarily be that I who thought was something; and remarking that this truth, I think, therefore I am, was so solid and so certain that all the most extravagant suppositions of the sceptics were incapable of upsetting it, I judged that I could receive it without scruple as the first principle of the philosophy that I sought.","Greek history is peculiar in the fact that, except in Sparta, the influence of tradition was extraordinarily weak in Greece; moreover there was almost no political morality.","Most people learn nothing from experience except confirmation of their own prejudices.","Science tells us what we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive to many things of very great importance. Theology, on the other hand, induces a dogmatic belief that we have knowledge where in fact we have ignorance, and by doing so generates a kind of impertinent insolence towards the universe. Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting fairy tales. It is not good either to forget the questions that philosophy asks, or to persuade ourselves that we have found indubitable answers to them. To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralysed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can still do for those who study it.","It is not difficult for an unwise mother quite unintentionally to centre the heterosexual feelings of a young son upon herself, and it is true that, if this is done, the evil consequences pointed out by Freud will probably ensue. This is, however, much less likely to occur if the mother\'s sexual life is satisfying to her, for in that case she will not look to her child for a type of emotional satisfaction which ought to be sought only from adults. The parental impulse in its purity is an impulse to care for the young, not to demand affection from them, and if a woman is happy in her sexual life she will abstain spontaneously from all improper demands for emotional response from her child.","It is not good for men to get all that they wish to get. One may say that Heraclitus values power obtained through self-mastery, and despises the passions that distract men from their central ambitions.\u201d","The argument is really no better than that. There is no reason why the world could not have come into being without a cause; nor, on the other hand, is there any reason why it should not have always existed.

The hard-headed developed, through Bentham, Ricardo, and Marx, by logical stages into Stalin; the soft-hearted, by other logical stages, through Fichte, Byron, Carlyle, and Nietzsche, into Hitler. This statement, of course, is too schematic to be quite true, but it may serve as a map and a mnemonic. The stages in the evolution of ideas have had almost the quality of the Hegelian dialectic: doctrines have developed, by steps that each seem natural, into their opposites. But the developments have not been due solely to the inherent movement of ideas; they have been governed, throughout, by external circumstances and the reflection of these circumstances in human emotions. That this is the case may be made evident by one outstanding fact: that the ideas of liberalism have undergone no part of this development in America, where they remain to this day as in Locke.","One of the persistant delusions of mankind is that some sections of the human race are morally better or worse than others.

But when such behaviour strains natural instinct too severely nature takes her revenge by producing either listlessness or destructiveness, either of which may cause a structure imposed by reason to break down.","There was formerly a capacity for lightheartedness and play which has been to some extent inhibited by the cult of efficiency. The modern man thinks that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its own sake.","The aristocratic rebel, of whom Byron was in his day the exemplar, is a very different type from the leader of a peasant or proletarian revolt. Those who are hungry have no need of an elaborate philosophy to stimulate or excuse discontent, and anything of the kind appears to the m, merely an amusement of the idle rich. They want what others have, not some intangible and metaphysical good. Though they may preach Christian love, as the medieval communist rebels did, their real reasons for doing so are very simple: that the lack of it in the rich and powerful causes the sufferings of the poor, and that the presence of it among comrades in revolt is thought essential to success. But experience of the struggle leads to a despair of the power of love, leaving naked hate as the driving force. A rebel of this type, if, like Marx, he invents a philosophy, invents one solely designed to demonstrate the ultimate victory of his party, not one concerned with values. His values remain primitive: the good is enough to eat, and the rest is talk. No hungry man is likely to think otherwise.","\u0411\u0443\u043d\u0442 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445

\u201cnoble. Kant says that if you are kind to your brother because you arc fond of him, you have no moral merit: an act only has moral merit when it is performed because the moral law enjoins it. Although pleasure is not the good, it is nevertheless unjust\u2014so Kant maintains\u2014 that the virtuous should suffer. Since this often happens in this world, there must be another world where they are rewarded after death, and there must be a God to secure justice in the life hereafter. He rejects all the old metaphysical arguments for God and immortality, but considers his new ethical argument irrefutable. Kant himself was a man whose outlook on practical affairs was kindly and humanitarian, but the same cannot be said of most of those who rejected happiness as the good.\u201d","Nor are his purely intellectual merits by any means to be despised. He has, in many respects, clarified Plato\'s teaching; he has developed, with as much consistency as possible, the type of theory advocated by him in common with many others. His arguments against materialism are good, and his whole conception of the relation of soul and body is clearer than that of Plato or Aristotle. Like Spinoza, he has a certain kind of moral purity and loftiness, which is very impressive. He is always sincere, never shrill or censorious, invariably concerned to tell the reader, as simply as he can, what he believes to be important. Whatever one may think of him as a theoretical philosopher, it is impossible not to love him as a man. The life of Plotinus is known, so far as it is known, through the biography written by his friend and disciple Porphyry, a Semite whose real name was Malchus. There are, however, miraculous elements in this account, which make it difficult to place a complete reliance upon its more credible portions. Plotinus considered his spatio-temporal appearance","...I went to Chicago, where I stayed with an eminent gynaecologist and his family...He was obviously a man of very strong sexual passions, and his face was ravaged by the efforts of self-control.","When we look at the sun we wish to know [135]something about the sun itself, which is ninety-three million miles away; but what we see is dependent upon our eyes, and it is difficult to suppose that our eyes can affect what happens at a distance of ninety-three million miles. Physics tells us that certain electromagnetic waves start from the sun, and reach our eyes after about eight minutes. They there produce disturbances in the rods and cones, thence in the optic nerve, thence in the brain. At the end of this purely physical series, by some odd miracle, comes the experience which we call \\"seeing the sun,\\" and it is such experiences which form the whole and sole reason for our belief in the optic nerve, the rods and cones, the ninety-three million miles, the electromagnetic waves, and the sun itself. It is this curious oppositeness of direction between the order of causation as affirmed by physics, and the order of evidence as revealed by theory of knowledge, that causes the most serious perplexities in regard to the nature of physical reality. Anything that invalidates our seeing, as a source of knowledge concerning physical reality, invalidates also the whole of physics and physiology. And yet, starting from a common-sense acceptance of our seeing, physics has been led step by step to the construction of the causal chain in which our seeing is the last link, and the immediate object which we see cannot be regarded as that initial cause which we believe to be ninety-three million miles away, and which we are inclined to regard as the \\"real\\" sun.","Those of us who love poetry read the great masterpieces of modern literature before we have any experience of the passions they deal with. To come across a new masterpiece with a more mature mind is a wonderful experience, and one which I have found almost overwhelming.","If you desire glory, you may envy Napoleon. But Napoleon envied Caesar, Caesar envied Alexander, and Alexander, I daresay, envied Hercules, who never existed. You cannot, therefore, get away from envy by means of success alone, for there will always be in history or legend some person even more successful than you are. You can get away from envy by enjoying the pleasures that come your way, by doing the work that you have to do, and by avoiding comparisons with those whom you imagine, perhaps quite falsely, to be more fortunate than yourself.","Un mondo senza piaceri e senza affetti \xe8 un mondo privo di valore.

Before He created the world He foresaw all the pain and misery that it would contain; He is therefore responsible for all of it. It is useless to argue that the pain in the world is due to sin. In the first place, this is not true; it is not sin that causes rivers to overflow their banks or volcanoes to erupt. But even if it were true, it would make no difference. If I were going to beget a child knowing that the child was going to be a homicidal maniac, I should be responsible for his crimes. If God knew in advance the sins of which man would be guilty, He was clearly responsible for all the consequences of those sins when He decided to create man.","Eternal life, according to some theologians, for example, Dean Inge, does not mean existence throughout every moment of future time, but a mode of being wholly independent of time, in which there is no before and after, and therefore no logical possibility of change.","Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves.","I was not born happy.

Yet, by death, by illness, by poverty, or by the voice of duty, we must learn, each one of us, that the world was not made for us, and that, however beautiful may be the things we crave, Fate may nevertheless forbid them.

How much murder and anarchy are we prepared to endure for the sake of great achievements such as those of the Renaissance?","...we are confronted by the dangers facing mankind if science advances while international anarchy continues. Science enables us to realise our purposes, and if our purposes are evil, the result is disaster. If the world remains filled with malevolence and hate, the more scientific it becomes the more horrible it will be. To diminish the virulence of these passions is, therefore, an essential of human progress. To a very great extent their existence has been brought about by a wrong sexual ethic and a bad sexual education. For the future of civilisation a new and better sexual ethic is indispensable. It is this fact that makes the reform of sexual morality one of the vital needs of our time.","And as regards industrial enterprises there is little difference, from the psychological point of view, between those conducted by the state and those conducted by large private corporations. In either case there is a government which in fact, if not in intention, is remote from those whom it controls. It is only the members of the government, whether of a state or of a large corporation, who can retain the sense of individual initiative, and there is inevitably a tendency for governments to regard those who work for them more or less as they regard their machines, that is to say merely as necessary means. The desirability of smooth co-operation constantly tends to increase the size of units, and therefore to diminish the number of those who still possess the power of initiative.","To preach an altruistic morality appears to me somewhat useless, because it will appeal only to those who already have altruistic desires. But to preach rationality is somewhat different, since rationality helps us to realize our own desires on the whole, whatever they may be.","Hegel\'s philosophy is very difficult\u2014he is, I should say, the hardest to understand of all the great philosophers. Before entering on any detail, a general characterization may prove helpful.","Casi nadie es capaz de ser feliz en una c\xe1rcel, y las pasiones que nos encierran en nosotros mismos constituyen uno de los peores tipos de c\xe1rcel. Las m\xe1s comunes de estas pasiones son el miedo, la envidia, el sentimiento de pecado, la autocompasi\xf3n y la autoadmiraci\xf3n. En todas ellas, nuestros deseos se centran en nosotros mismos: no existe aut\xe9ntico inter\xe9s por el mundo exterior, solo la preocupaci\xf3n de que pueda hacernos da\xf1o o deje de alimentar nuestro ego.

The scepticism that I advocate amounts only to this: (1) that when the experts are agreed, the opposite opinion cannot be held to be certain; (2) that when they are agreed, no opinion can be regarded as certain by a non-expert; and (3) that when they all hold that no sufficient grounds for a positive opinion exist, the ordinary man would do well to suspend his judgment.","Throughout this long development, from 600 B.C. to the present day, philosophers have been divided into those who wished to tighten social bonds and those who wished to relax them. With this difference others have been associated. The disciplinarians have advocated some system of dogma, either old or new, and have therefore been compelled to be, in a greater or less degree, hostile to science, since their dogmas could not be proved empirically. They have almost invariably taught that happiness is not the good, but that \u201cnobility or \u201cheroism\u201d is to be preferred. They have had a sympathy with the irrational parts of human nature, since they have felt reason to be inimical to social cohesion. The libertarians, on the other hand, with the exception of the extreme anarchists, have tended to be scientific, utilitarian, rationalistic, hostile to violent passion, and enemies of all the more profound forms of religion. This conflict existed in Greece before the rise of what we recognize as philosophy, and is already quite explicit in the earliest Greek thought. In changing forms, it has persisted down to the present day, and no doubt will persist for many ages to come. It is clear that each party to this dispute\u2014as to all that persist through long periods of time\u2014is partly right and partly wrong. Social cohesion is a necessity, and mankind has never yet succeeded in enforcing cohesion by merely rational arguments. Every community is exposed to two opposite dangers: ossification through too much discipline and reverence for tradition, on the one hand; on the other hand, dissolution, or subjection to foreign conquest, through the growth of an individualism and personal independence that makes co-operation impossible.\u201d","And where a solution appears possible, the new logic provides a method which enables us to obtain results that do not merely embody personal idiosyncrasies, but must command the assent of all who are competent to form an opinion.","I wish to understand [Plato], but to treat him with as little reverence as if he were a contemporary English or American advocate of totalitarianism.","Education, the press, politics, religion\u2014in a word, all the great forces in the world\u2014are at present on the side of irrationality; they are in the hands of men who flatter King Demos in order to lead him astray. The remedy does not lie in anything heroically cataclysmic, but in the efforts of individuals towards a more sane and balanced view of our relations to our neighbours and to the world. It is to intelligence, increasingly widespread, that we must look for the solution of the ills from which our world is suffering.","His most important books are his two Logics, and these must be understood if the reasons for his views on other subjects are to be rightly apprehended.","I come now to the question of forms of government, and it is natural to begin with absolute monarchy, as the oldest, simplest, and most widespread of the constitutions known in historical times.","By being compelled to acquire good habits, we shall in time, Aristotle thinks, come to find pleasure in performing good actions. One is reminded of Hamlet\u2019s speech to his mother: Assume a virtue if you have it not.

No vestige of liberty remains, in thought or speech or action. I was stifled and oppressed by the weight of the machine as by a cope of lead. Yet I think it the right government for Russia at this moment. If you ask yourself how Dostoevsky\'s characters should be governed, you will understand. Yet it is terrible.","But as men grow more industrialised and regimented, the kind of delight that is common in children becomes impossible to adults because they are always thinking of the next thing and cannot let themselves be absorbed in the moment. This habit of thinking of the \u2018next thing\u2019 is more fatal to any kind of aesthetic excellence than any other habit of mind that can be imagined, and if art, in any important sense, is to survive it will not be by the foundation of solemn academies, but by recapturing the capacity for wholehearted joys and sorrows which prudence and foresight have all but destroyed.","All who are capable of absorption in an inward passion must have experienced at times the strange feeling of unreality in common objects, the loss of contact with daily things, in which the solidity of the outer world is lost, and the soul seems, in utter loneliness, to bring forth, out of its own depths, the mad dance of fantastic phantoms which have hitherto appeared as independently real and living.","When there are rational grounds for an opinion, people are content to set them forth and wait for them to operate. In such cases, people do not hold their opinions with passion; they hold them calmly, and set forth their reasons quietly. The opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists; indeed the passion is the measure of the holder\u2019s lack of rational conviction.","What makes the difference between \\"ideal\\" and an ordinary object of desire is that the former is impersonal; it is something having(at least ostensibly)no special reference to the ego of the man who feels the desire, and therefore capable, theoretically, of being desired by everybody.Thus we might define an \\"ideal\\" as something desired, not egocentric, and such that the personDesiring it wishes that everyone else also desired it. I may wish that everybody had enough to eat,that everybody felt kindly towards everybody, and so on, and if I wish anything of this kind I shallalso wish others to wish it. In this way, I can build up what looks like an impersonal ethic,although in fact it rests upon the personal basis of my own desires--for the desire remains mineeven when what is desired has no reference to myself. For example, one man may wish thateverybody understood science, and another that everybody appreciated art; it is a personaldifference between the two men that produces this difference in their desires. The personal element becomes apparent as soon as controversy is involved. Suppose some mansays: \\"You are wrong to wish everybody to be happy; you ought to desire the happiness ofGermans and the unhappiness of everyone else. \\"Here \\"ought\\" maybe taken to mean that that iswhat the speaker wishes me to desire. I might retort that, not being German, it is psychologicallyimpossible for me to desire the unhappiness of all non-Germans; but this answer seemsinadequate. Again, there may be a conflict of purely impersonal ideals. Nietzsche\'s hero differs from aChristian saint, yet both are impersonally admired, the one by Nietzscheans, the other byChristians. How are we to decide between the two except by means of our own desires? Yet, ifThere is nothing further, an ethical disagreement can only be decided by emotional appeals, or byforce-in the ultimate resort,. By war. On questions of fact, we can appeal to science and scientificmethods of observation; but on ultimate questions of ethics there seems to be nothing analogous.Yet, if this is really the case, ethical disputes resolve themselves into contests for power\u2014including propaganda power.","... any hypothesis, however absurd, may be useful in science, if it enables a discoverer to conceive things in a new way; but when it has served this purpose by luck, it is likely to become an obstacle to further advance.","A king or despot can maintain his power if he is astute in internal politics and successful externally. If he is quasi-divine, his dynasty may be prolonged indefinitely. But the growth of civilisation puts an end to belief in his divinity; defeat in war is not always avoidable; and political astuteness cannot be an invariable attribute of monarchs. Therefore sooner or later, if there is no external conquest, there is revolution, and the monarchy is either abolished or shorn of its power.","The implication of the free-will doctrine are not realized by those who hold it. We say \u201cwhy did you do it? and expect the answer to mention beliefs and desires which caused action. When a man does not himself know why he acted as he did, we may search his unconscious for a cause, but it never occurs to us that there may have been no cause.\u201d","The world of universals, therefore, may also be described as the world of being. The world of being is unchangeable, rigid, exact, delightful to the mathematician, the logician, the builder of metaphysical systems, and all who love perfection more than life. The world of existence is fleeting, vague, without sharp boundaries, without any clear plan or arrangement, but it contains all thoughts and feelings, all the data of sense, and all physical objects, everything that can do either good or harm, everything that makes any difference to the value of life and the world. According to our temperaments, we shall prefer the contemplation of the one or of the other. The one we do not prefer will probably seem to us a pale shadow of the one we prefer, and hardly worthy to be regarded as in any sense real. But the truth is that both have the same claim on our impartial attention, both are real, and both are important to the metaphysician.","Political and social institutions are to be judged by the good or harm that they do to individuals. Do they encourage creativeness rather than possessiveness? Do they embody or promote a spirit of reverence between human beings? Do they preserve self-respect? In","A government of the rich prevailed in all the free cities of the Middle Ages, and survived in Venice until Napoleon extinguished it. Such governments have been, on the whole, more enlightened and astute than any others known to history. Venice, in particular, steered a prudent course through centuries of complicated intrigue, and had a diplomatic service far more efficient than that of any other State. Money made in commerce is made by cleverness which is not dictatorial, and this characteristic is displayed by governments composed of successful merchants. The modern industrial magnate is a totally different type, partly because he deals largely with the technical manipulation of materials, partly because his dealings with human beings are preponderantly with an army of employees rather than with equals who must be persuaded, not coerced.","Without being aware that I was following in my father\u2019s footsteps, I read, before I went to Cambridge, Mill\u2019s Logic and Political Economy, and made elaborate notes in which I practised the art of expressing the gist of each paragraph in a single sentence.","It is a dangerous thing to allow one\'s affections to centre too much in one person; for affection always liable to be thwarted, and life itself is frail. One learns many things as year by year adds to the burden of one\'s life; and I think the chief of all is the power of making all one\'s loves purely contemplative. Do you know Walt Whitman\'s \'Out of the rolling ocean the crowd\'? One learns to love all that is good with the same love - a love that knows of its existence, and feels warmed to the world by that knowledge, but asks for no possession, for no private gain except the contemplation itself.","But without going to such extremes prudence may easily involve the loss of some of the best things in life. The worshipper of Dionysus reacts against prudence. In intoxication, physical or spiritual, he recovers an intensity of feeling which prudence had destroyed; he finds the world full of delight and beauty, and his imagination is suddenly liberated from the prison of every-day preoccupations","One of the defects of all philosophers since Plato is that their inquiries into ethics proceed on the assumption that they already know the conclusions to be reached.","The bulk of the population of every country is persuaded that all marriage customs other than its own are immoral, and that those who combat this view do so only in order to justify their own loose lives. In India, the remarriage of widows is traditionally regarded as a thing too horrible to contemplate. In Catholic countries divorce is thought very wicked, but some failure of conjugal fidelity is tolerated, at least in men. In America divorce is easy, but extra-conjugal relations are condemned with the utmost severity. Mohammedans believe in polygamy, which we think degrading. All these differing opinions are held with extreme vehemence, and very cruel persecutions are inflicted upon those who contravene them. Yet no one in any of the various countries makes the slightest attempt to show that the custom of his own country contributes more to human happiness than the custom of others.","Santayana....reasoned that the young men who were being killed in the war would die anyhow sooner or later, and would be good for nothing while they lived.","I like mathematics because it is not human and has nothing particular to do with this planet or with the whole accidental universe \u2013 because, like Spinoza\'s God, it won\'t love us in return.","And always, in our highly regularised way of life, he is obsessed by thoughts of themorrow. Of all the precepts in the Gospels the one that Christians have most neglected is the commandment to take no thought for the morrow. If a man is prudent, thought for the morrow will lead him to save; if he is imprudent, it will make him apprehensive of being unable to pay his debts. In either case the moment loses its savour. Everything is organised, nothing is spontaneous.","In England, under the Blasphemy Laws, it is illegal to express disbelief in the Christian religion, though in practice the law is not set in motion against the well-to-do. It is also illegal to teach what Christ taught on the subject of non-resistance. Therefore, whoever wishes to avoid becoming a criminal must profess to agree with Christ\u2019s teaching, but must avoid saying what that teaching was.","The Bolshevik theory requires that every country, sooner or later, should go through what Russia is going through now. And in every country in such a condition we may expect to find the government falling into the hands of ruthless men, who have not by nature any love for freedom, and who will see little importance in hastening the transition from dictatorship to freedom \u2026 Is it not almost inevitable that men placed as the Bolsheviks are placed in Russia \u2026 will be loath to relinquish their monopoly of power, and will find reasons for remaining until some new revolution ousts them?","Power over opinion, like all other forms of power, tends to coalescence and concentration, leading logically to a State monopoly. But even apart from war it would be rash to assume that a State monopoly of propaganda must make a government invulnerable. In the long run, those who possess the power are likely to become too flagrantly indifferent to the interests of the common man, as the Popes were in the time of Luther.","Socialism as a panacea seems to me to be mistaken in this way, since it is too ready to suppose that better economic conditions will of themselves make men happy. It is not only more material goods that men need, but more freedom, more self-direction, more outlet for creativeness, more opportunity for the joy of life, more voluntary co\xf6peration, and less involuntary subservience to purposes not their own.","It seems that sin is geographical. From this conclusion, it is only a small step to the further conclusion that the notion of \u201csin is illusory, and that the cruelty habitually practised in punishing it is unnecessary. It is just this conclusion which is so unwelcome to many minds, since the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists. That is why they invented Hell.\u201d","Social cohesion is a necessity, and mankind has never yet succeeded in enforcing cohesion by merely rational arguments. Every community is exposed to two opposite dangers: ossification through too much discipline and reverence for tradition, on the one hand; on the other hand, dissolution, or subjection to foreign conquest, through the growth of an individualism and personal independence that makes co-operation impossible. In general, important civilizations start with a rigid and superstitious system, gradually relaxed, and leading, at a certain stage, to a period of brilliant genius, while the good of the old tradition remains and the evil inherent in its dissolution has not yet developed. But as the evil unfolds, it leads to anarchy, thence, inevitably, to a new tyranny, producing a new synthesis secured by a new system of dogma. The doctrine of liberalism is an attempt to escape from this endless oscillation. The essence of liberalism is an attempt to secure a social order not based on irrational dogma, and insuring stability without involving more restraints than are necessary for the preservation of the community. Whether this attempt can succeed only the future can determine.","Socrates adds to the doctrine of Protagoras the doctrine of Heraclitus, that everything is always changing, i.e. that \u201call the things we are pleased to say \u2018are\u2019 really are in process of becoming.","The discovery of geometry had intoxicated them, and its a priori deductive method appeared capable of universal application. They would prove, for instance, that all reality is one, that there is no such thing as change, that the world of sense is a world of mere illusion; and the strangeness of their results gave them no qualms because they believed in the correctness of their reasoning.","Nadie se preocupa por lo que va a ocurrir dentro de millones de a\xf1os.

If such men control an unpopular government, the result is to make the bulk of the population even more frivolous and thoughtless than it would naturally be\u2014a result which is much promoted by the knowledge that all thought is potentially heretical, and therefore dangerous. The rulers, in a theocracy, are likely to be fanatics; being fanatics, they will be severe; being severe, they will be opposed; being opposed, they will become more severe. Their power-impulses will wear, even to themselves, the cloak of religious zeal, and will therefore be subject to no restraint. Hence the rack and the stake, the Gestapo and the Cheka.","The barbarian invasion put an end, for six centuries, to the civilization of western Europe. It lingered in Ireland until the Danes destroyed it in the ninth century;","Existe este hecho curioso: cuanto m\xe1s intensa ha sido la religi\xf3n de cualquier periodo, y m\xe1s profunda la creencia dogm\xe1tica, han sido mayor la crueldad y peores las circunstancias. En las llamadas edades de la fe, cuando los hombres realmente cre\xedan en la religi\xf3n cristiana en toda su integridad hubo la Inquisici\xf3n con sus torturas; hubo muchas desdichadas mujeres quemadas por brujas; y toda clase de crueldades practicadas en toda clase de gente en nombre de la religi\xf3n.","We have seen that monarchy and oligarchy have both merits and demerits. The principal demerit of both is that, sooner or later, the government becomes so indifferent to the desires of ordinary men that there is revolution","The secular power, on the contrary, was in the hands of kings and barons of Teutonic descent, who endeavoured to preserve what they could of the institutions that they had brought out of the forests of Germany. Absolute power was alien to those institutions, and so was what appeared to these vigorous conquerors as a dull and spiritless legality. The king had to share his power with the feudal aristocracy,","A government is usually called \u2018democratic\u2019 if a fairly large percentage of the population has a share of political power. The most extreme Greek democracies excluded women and slaves, and America considered itself a democracy before women had the vote. Clearly an oligarchy approaches more nearly to a democracy as the percentage possessed of political power increases. The characteristic features of oligarchy only appear when this percentage is rather small.","Self-government in industry, for example, is an indispensable condition of a good society. Those acts of an individual or a group which have no very great importance for outsiders ought to be freely decided by that individual or group. This is recognized as regards religion, but ought to be recognized over a much wider field.","Chinese problems, even if they affected no one outside China, would be of vast importance, since the Chinese are estimated to constitute about a quarter of the human race. In fact, however, all the world will be vitally affected by the development of Chinese affairs, which may well prove a decisive factor, for good or evil, during the next two centuries. This makes it important, to Europe and America almost as much as to Asia,","I call power revolutionary when it depends upon a large group united by a new creed, programme, or sentiment, such as Protestantism, Communism, or desire for national independence. I call power naked when it results merely from the power-loving impulses of individuals or groups, and wins from its subjects only submission through fear, not active cooperation. It will be seen that the nakedness of power is a matter of degree. In a democratic country, the power of the government is not naked in relation to opposing political parties, but is naked in relation to a convinced anarchist. Similarly, where persecution exists, the power of the Church is naked in relation to heretics, but not in relation to orthodox sinners.","Popular Cynicism did not teach abstinence from the good things of this world, but only a certain indifference to them.","In his philosophy, nothing is held to be quite true, and nothing quite false; what can be uttered has only a limited truth, and, since men must talk, we cannot blame them for not speaking the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The best we can do, according to Bradley, is to say things that are \u201cnot intellectually corrigible\u2014further progress is only possible through a synthesis of thought and feeling, which, when achieved, will lead to our saying nothing.\u201d","Above all, there would be an endeavor to rouse and stimulate the love of mental adventure. The world in which we live is various and astonishing: some of the things that seem plainest grow more and more difficult the more they are considered; other things, which might have been thought quite impossible to discover, have nevertheless been laid bare by genius and industry. The powers of thought, the vast regions which it can master, the much more vast regions which it can only dimly suggest to imagination, give to those whose minds have traveled beyond the daily round an amazing richness of material, an escape from the triviality and wearisomeness of familiar routine, by which the whole of life is filled with interest, and the prison walls of the commonplace are broken down. The same love of adventure which takes men to the South Pole, the same passion for a conclusive trial of strength which\xa0leads some men to welcome war, can find in creative thought an outlet which is neither wasteful nor cruel, but increases the dignity of man by incarnating in life some of that shining splendor which the human spirit is bringing down out of the unknown. To give this joy, in a greater or less measure, to all who are capable of it, is the supreme end for which the education of the mind is to be valued.","William James used to preach the \u201cwill to believe. For my part, I should wish to preach the \u201cwill to doubt.\u201d None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error. The methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate.\u201d","Hegel thought that, if enough was known about a thing to distinguish it from all other things, then all its properties could be inferred by logic. This was a mistake, and from this mistake arose the whole imposing edifice of his system. This illustrates an important truth, namely, that the worse your logic, the more interesting the consequences to which it gives rise.","One of the most important purposes of government should be to prevent issues from becoming so acute as to lead to civil war; and from this point of view democracy, where it is habitual, is probably preferable to any other known form of government. The difficulty of democracy, as a form of government, is that it demands a readiness for compromise. The beaten party must not consider that a principle is involved of such importance as to make it pusillanimous to yield; on the other hand, the majority must not press the advantage to the point at which it provokes a revolt. This requires practice, respect for the law, and the habit of believing that opinions other than one\'s own may not be a proof of wickedness. What is even more necessary, there must not be a state of acute fear, for, when there is such a state, men look for a leader and submit to him when found, with the result that he probably becomes a dictator. Given these conditions, democracy is capable of being the most stable form of government hitherto devised.","External discipline is the only road to happiness for those unfortunates whose self-absorption is too profound to be cured in any other way.","\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 \u0628\u062e\u0637\u0649 \u0623\u0648\u0633\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0633\u0645\u062d \u0628\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \\"\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0626 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0629\\" \u0644\u0640 \u0646\u064a\u0648\u062a\u0646 \u060c \u0623\u0648 \\"\u0623\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0639\\" \u0644\u0640 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u0646 . \u0641\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u0628\u0644\u0649 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0647 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u062a\u0623\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0647 ! \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u0645\u0631 \u064a\u0624\u0633\u0641 \u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u0647 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u060c \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0642\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0648\u0642\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0636\u0631 \u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0646\u062a\u064a\u062c\u0629 \u062d\u062a\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0633\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u062a\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u060c \u0648\u0644\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0631\u0636\u0649 \u0628\u0647 \u0631\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u064a\u0627\u064b","newly powerful nations, with the exception of Spain, showed themselves as capable of great achievement as the Italians had been. From the sixteenth century onward, the history of European thought is dominated by the Reformation. The Reformation was a complex many-sided movement, and owed its success to a variety of causes. In the main, it was a revolt","There are no arguing with a mood; it can be changed by some fortunate event, or by a change in our bodily condition, but it cannot be changed by argument. I have frequently experienced myself the mood in which I felt that all is vanity; I have emerged from it not by means of any philosophy, but owing to some imperative necessity of action. If your child is ill, you may be unhappy, but you will not feel that all in vanity; you will feel that restoring of the child to health is a matter to be attended to regardless of the question whether there is ultimate value in human life or not.","In religion and politics, on the contrary, though there is as yet nothing approaching scientific knowledge, everybody considers it de rigueur to have a dogmatic opinion, to be backed up by inflicting starvation, prison, and war, and to be carefully guarded from argumentative competition with any different opinion. If only men could be brought into a tentatively agnostic frame of mind about these matters, nine-tenths of the evils of the modern world would be cured.","But history is perhaps an even better antidote to anarchic individualism as well as to a lifeless traditionalism","The faculty of being acquainted with things other than itself is the main characteristic of a mind.","Hume\u2019s philosophy, whether true or false, represents the bankruptcy of eighteenth-century reasonableness. He starts out, like Locke, with the intention of being sensible and empirical, taking nothing on trust, but seeking whatever instruction is to be obtained from experience and observation. But having a better intellect than Locke\u2019s, a greater acuteness in analysis, and a smaller capacity for accepting comfortable inconsistencies, he arrives at the disastrous conclusion that from experience and observation nothing is to be learnt. There is no such thing as a rational belief: \u201cIf we believe that fire warms, or water refreshes, \u2019tis only because it costs us too much pains to think otherwise. We cannot help believing, but no belief can be grounded in reason. Nor can one line of action be more rational than another, since all alike are based upon irrational convictions. This last conclusion, however, Hume seems not to have drawn. Even in his most sceptical chapter, in which he sums up the conclusions of Book I, he says: \u201cGenerally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; those in philosophy only ridiculous.\u201d He has no right to say this. \u201cDangerous\u201d is a causal word, and a sceptic as to causation cannot know that anything is \u201cdangerous.\u201d","He urges his young disciple and friend Pythocles to \u201cflee from every form of culture. It was a natural consequence of his principles that he advised abstinence from public life, for in proportion as a man achieves power he increases the number of those who envy him and therefore wish to do him injury.\u201d","What would have happened if Einstein had advanced something equally new in the sphere of religion or politics? English people would have found elements of Prussianism in his theory; anti-Semites would have regarded it as a Zionist plot; nationalists in all countries would have found it tainted with lily-livered pacifism, and proclaimed it a mere dodge for escaping military service. All the old-fashioned professors would have approached Scotland Yard to get the importation of his writings prohibited. Teachers favourable to him would have been dismissed. He, meantime, would have captured the Government of some backward country, where it would have become illegal to teach anything except his doctrine, which would have grown into a mysterious dogma not understood by anybody. Ultimately the truth or falsehood of his doctrine would be decided on the battlefield, without the collection of any fresh evidence for or against it. This method is the logical outcome of William James\u2019s will to believe.","Except when he feels enthusiasm for a leader, the voter in a large democracy has so little sense of power that he often does not think it worth while to use his vote. If he is not a keen propagandist for one of the parties, the vastness of the forces that decide who shall govern makes his own part in them appear completely negligible. In practice, all that he can do, as a rule, is to vote for one or other of two men, whose programmes may not interest him, and may differ very little, and who, he knows, may with impunity abandon their programmes as soon as they are elected. If, on the other hand, there is a leader whom he enthusiastically admires, the psychology involved is that which we considered in connection with monarchy: it is that of the tie between a king and the tribe or sect of his active supporters. Every skilful political agitator or organiser devotes himself to stimulating devotion to an individual. If the individual is a great leader, the result is one-man government; if he is not, the caucus which has secured his election becomes the real power.","The wise man will try to live unnoticed, so as to have no enemies.","The employee differs from a slave in the fact that he is free to change his job if he can, and in his right to spend his non-working hours as he pleases. The analogy that I wish to bring out is in relation to government. Tyrannies, oligarchies, and democracies differed in their relations to free men; in relation to slaves, they were all alike. Similarly in a capitalist industrial enterprise the power may be divided among investors monarchically, oligarchically, or democratically, but employees, unless they are investors, have no share in it whatever, and are thought to have as little claim as slaves were thought to have in antiquity.","Casual experience of life is of very little use to a specialist, such as I aspire to be; good manners are absolutely useless.","This is, however, only a part of the truth concerning the uncertainty of philosophy. There are many questions\u2014and among them those that are of the profoundest interest to our spiritual life\u2014which, so far as we can see, must remain insoluble to the human intellect unless its powers become of quite a different order from what they are now. Has the universe any unity of plan or purpose, or is it a fortuitous concourse of atoms? Is consciousness a permanent part of the universe, giving hope of indefinite growth in wisdom, or is it a transitory accident on a small planet on which life must ultimately become impossible? Are good and evil of importance to the universe or only to man? Such questions are asked by philosophy, and variously answered by various philosophers. But it would seem that, whether answers be otherwise discoverable or not, the answers suggested by philosophy are none of them demonstrably true. Yet, however slight may be the hope of discovering an answer, it is part of the business of philosophy to continue the consideration of such questions, to make us aware of their importance, to examine all the approaches to them, and to keep alive that speculative interest in the universe which is apt to be killed by confining ourselves to definitely ascertainable knowledge.","According to Cicero, he held that \u201cfriendship cannot be divorced from pleasure, and for that reason must be cultivated, because without it neither can we live in safety and without fear, nor even pleasantly.","Nunca ha estado del todo claro si el secreto de la felicidad consiste en no ser completamente imb\xe9cil o en serlo.","The quarrel between Hume and Rousseau is symbolic: Rousseau was mad but influential, Hume was sane but had no followers. Subsequent British empiricists rejected his scepticism without refuting it; Rousseau and his followers agreed with Hume that no belief is based on reason, but thought the heart superior to reason, and allowed it to lead them to convictions very different from those that Hume retained in practice. German philosophers, from Kant to Hegel, had not assimilated Hume\u2019s arguments. I say this deliberately, in spite of the belief which many philosophers share with Kant, that his Critique of Pure Reason answered Hume. In fact, these philosophers\u2014at least Kant and Hegel\u2014represent a pre-Humian type of rationalism, and can be refuted by Humian arguments. The philosophers who cannot be refuted in this way are those who do not pretend to be rational, such as Rousseau, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. The growth of unreason throughout the nineteenth century and what has passed of the twentieth is a natural sequel to Hume\u2019s destruction of empiricism.","What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out, which is its exact opposite.","The attitude of uncompromising heroism is attractive, and appeals especially to the dramatic instinct. But the purpose of the serious revolutionary is not personal heroism, nor martyrdom, but the creation of a happier world. Those who have the happiness of the world at heart will shrink from attitudes and the facile hysteria of \\"no parley with the enemy.\\" They will not embark upon enterprises, however arduous and austere, which are likely to involve the martyrdom of their country and the discrediting of their ideals. It is by slower and less showy methods that the new world must be built [...] To find fault with those who urge these considerations, or to accuse them of faint-heartedness, is mere sentimental self-indulgence, sacrificing the good we can do to the satisfaction of our own emotions.","scientific knowledge, though difficult, is not mysterious, but open to all who care to take the necessary trouble. The modern intellectual, therefore, inspires no awe, but remains a mere employee; except in a few cases, such as the Archbishop of Canterbury, he has failed to inherit the glamour which gave power to his predecessors.","Epicurus was a materialist, but not a determinist. He followed Democritus in believing that the world consists of atoms and the void; but he did not believe, as Democritus did, that the atoms are at all times completely controlled by natural laws.","With subjectivism in philosophy, anarchism in politics goes hand in hand.http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bertrand...","As soon as absolute truth is supposed to be contained in the sayings of a certain man, there is a body of experts to interpret his sayings, and these experts infallibly acquire power, since they hold the key to truth. Like any other privileged caste, they use their power for their own advantage. They are, however, in one respect worse than any other privileged caste, since it is their business to expound an unchanging truth, revealed once for all in utter perfection, so that they become necessarily opponents of all intellectual and moral progress. The church opposed Galileo and Darwin; in our own day it opposes Freud. In the days of its greatest power it went further in its opposition to the intellectual life.","Si nous n\'avions pas peur de la mort , je ne crois pas que serait jamais n\xe9e l\'id\xe9e d\'immortalit\xe9.","(1)\xa00 is a number.

The harm that is done by a religion is of two sorts, the one depending on the kind of belief which it is thought ought to be given to it, and the other upon the particular tenets believed. As regards the kind of belief: it is thought virtuous to have faith - that is to say, to have a conviction which cannot be shaken by contrary evidence. Or, if contrary evidence might induce doubt, it is held that contrary evidence must be suppressed. On such grounds the young are not allowed to hear arguments, in Russia, in favour of Capitalism, or, in America, in favour of Communism. This keeps the faith of both intact and ready for internecine war. The conviction that it is important to believe this or that, even if a free inquiry would not support the belief, is one which is common to almost all religions and which inspires all systems of State education. The consequence is that the minds of the young are stunted and are filled with fanatical hostility both to those who have other fanaticisms, and, even more virulently, to those who object to all fanaticisms.","Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in proportion to what he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as exemplified by his industry.","All medical men who have studied the matter know that punishment only aggravates the trouble. Sometimes the cause is physical, but usually it is psychological, and only curable by removing some deepseated and probably unconscious grievance. But most people enjoy punishing anyone who irritates them, and so the medical view is rejected as fancy nonsense. The","now I want to speak about the word \u2018theory\u2019. This was originally an Orphic word, which Cornford interprets as \u2018passionate sympathetic contemplation\u2019. In this state, he says, \u2018The spectator is identified with the suffering God, dies in his death, and rises again in his new birth.\u2019 for Pythagoras, the \u2018passionate sympathetic contemplation\u2019 was intellectual, and issued in mathematical knowledge. In this way, through Pythagoreanism, \u2018theory\u2019 gradually acquired its modern meaning; but for all who were inspired by Pythagoras it retained an element of ecstatic revelation. To those who have reluctantly learnt a little mathematics in school this may seem strange; but to those who have experienced the intoxicating delight of sudden understanding that mathematics gives, from time to time, to those who love it, the Pythagorean view will seem completely natural even if untrue.","Human nature is still, to a very great extent, regarded irrationally because it is pleasant to regard people as objects of praise and blame.","The qualities which make a successful politician in a democracy vary according to the character of the times; they are not the same in quiet times as they are during war or revolution. In quiet times, a man may succeed by giving an impression of solidity and sound judgement, but in times of excitement something more is needed. At such times, it is necessary to be an impressive speaker\u2014not necessarily eloquent in the conventional sense, for Robespierre and Lenin were not eloquent, but determined, passionate, and bold. The passion may be cold and controlled, but must exist and be felt. In excited times, a politician needs no power of reasoning, no apprehension of impersonal facts, and no shred of wisdom. What he must have is the capacity of persuading the multitude that what they passionately desire is attainable, and that he, through his ruthless determination, is the man to attain it. The most successful democratic politicians are those who succeed in abolishing democracy and becoming dictators.","There has been amazingly little opposition to most of the encroachments of ecclesiastical interests. One reason for this seems to be the widespread belief that religion is nowadays mild and tolerant and that persecutions are a thing of the past. This is a dangerous illusion. While many religious leaders are undoubtedly genuine friends of freedom and toleration and are furthermore confirmed believers in the separation of Church and State, there are unfortunately many others who would still persecute if they could and who do persecute when they can.","The laws of social dynamics are\u2014so I shall contend\u2014only capable of being stated in terms of power in its various forms. In order to discover these laws, it is necessary first to classify the forms of power, and then to review various important historical examples","The question as to which of these two theories applies to the actual world is, like all questions concerning the actual world, in itself irrelevant to pure mathematics.* But the argument against absolute position usually takes the form of maintaining that a space composed of points is logically inadmissible, and hence issues are raised which a philosophy of mathematics must discuss. In what follows, I am concerned only with the question: Is a space composed of points self-contradictory? It is true that, if this question be answered in the negative, the sole ground for denying that such a space exists in the actual world is removed; but this is a further point, which, being irrelevant to our subject, will be left entirely to the sagacity of the reader.","All Utopias that have hitherto been constructed\xa0are intolerably dull. Any man with any force in him would rather live in this world, with all its ghastly horrors, than in Plato\u2019s Republic or among Swift\u2019s Houyhnhnms. The men who make Utopias proceed upon a radically false assumption as to what constitutes a good life. They conceive that it is possible to imagine a certain state of society and a certain way of life which should be once for all recognized as good, and should then continue for ever and ever. They do not realize that much the greater part of a man\u2019s happiness depends upon activity, and only a very small remnant consists in passive enjoyment. Even the pleasures which do consist in enjoyment are only satisfactory, to most men, when they come in the intervals of activity. Social reformers, like inventors of Utopias, are apt to forget this very obvious fact of human nature. They aim rather at securing more leisure, and more opportunity for enjoying it, than at making work itself more satisfactory, more consonant with impulse, and a better outlet for creativeness and the desire to employ one\u2019s faculties. Work, in the modern world, is, to almost all who depend on earnings, mere work, not an embodiment of the desire for activity. Probably this is to a\xa0considerable extent inevitable. But in so far as it can be prevented something will be done to give a peaceful outlet to some of the impulses which lead to war.","What really moves people to believe in God is not any intellectual argument at all. Most people believe in God because they have been taught from early infancy to do it, and that is the main reason.","The practical distinction among passions comes as regards their success: some passions lead to success in what is desired; others, to failure. If you pursue the former, you will be happy; if the latter, unhappy.","The men who cause social changes are, as a rule, men who strongly desire to do so. Love of power, therefore, is a characteristic of the men who are causally important","The effects of this change were momentous. Truth was no longer to be ascertained by consulting authority, but by inward meditation. There was a tendency, quickly developed, towards anarchism in politics, and, in religion, towards mysticism, which had always fitted with difficulty into the framework of Catholic orthodoxy. There came to be not one Protestantism, but a multitude of sects; not one philosophy opposed to scholasticism, but as many as there","The same laws which produce growth also produce decay. Someday, the sun will grow cold, and life on the Earth will cease. The whole epoch of animals and plants is only an interlude between ages that were too hot and ages that will be too cold. There is no law of cosmic progress, but only an oscillation upward and downward, with a slow trend downward on the balance owing to the diffusion of energy. This, at least, is what science at present regards as most probable, and in our disillusioned generation it is easy to believe. From evolution, so far as out present knowledge shows, no ultimately optimistic philosophy can be validly inferred.","I\u2019m getting on pretty well with German, though I haven\u2019t arrived at the stage of finding it a reasonable medium for the expression of thought. I think the original couple who spoke it must have died rather soon after the Tower of Babel, leaving a rather pedantically-minded baby, who had learnt all the words of one syllable, and had to make up the long ones with them \u2013 at least how else can you account for such words as Handschule and be-ab-sichtigen? I","The qualities required for power behind the scenes are very different from those required for all other kinds, and as a rule, though not always, they are undesirable qualities.

Most people believe in God because they have been taught from early infancy to do it, and that is the main reason. Then I think that the next most powerful reason is the wish for safety, a sort of feeling that there is a big brother who will look after you. That plays a very profound part in influencing people\'s desire for a belief in God.","Inequality in the distribution of power has always existed in human communities, as far back as our knowledge extends. This is due partly to external necessity, partly to causes which are to be found in human nature. Most collective enterprises are only possible if they are directed by some governing body.","To discover a system for the avoidance of war is a vital need of our civilization; but no such system has a chance while men are so unhappy that mutual extermination seems to them less dreadful than continued endurance of the light of day.","The principle that we ought to obey God rather than man has been interpreted by Christians in two different ways. God\'s commands may be conveyed to the individual conscience either directly, or indirectly through the medium of the Church.","The three things needed to prevent revolution are government propaganda in education, respect for law, even in small things, and justice in law and administration, i.e., \u201cequality according to proportion, and for every man to enjoy his own (1307a, 1307b, 1310a).\u201d","The Church won, partly because it had almost a monopoly of education, partly because the kings were perpetually at war with each other, but mainly because, with very few exceptions, rulers and people alike profoundly believed that the Church possessed the power of the keys. The Church could decide whether a king should spend eternity in heaven or in hell; the Church could absolve subjects from the duty of allegiance, and so stimulate rebellion. The Church, moreover, represented order in place of anarchy, and consequently won the support of the rising mercantile class. In Italy, especially, this last consideration was decisive.","Modern philosophy begins with Descartes, whose fundamental certainty is the existence of himself and his thoughts, from which the external world is to be inferred. This was only the first stage in a development, through Berkeley and Kant, to Fichte, for whom everything is only an emanation of the ego. This was insanity, and, from this extreme, philosophy has been attempting, ever since, to escape into the world of every-day common sense.","It seems that sin is geographical. From this conclusion, it is only a small step to the further conclusion that the notion of \'sin\' is illusory, and that the cruelty habitually practised in punishing it is unnecessary.","further into the past the boredom becomes still worse. Imagine the monotony of winter in a mediaeval village. People could not read or write, they had only candles to give them light after dark, the smoke of their one fire filled the only room that was not bitterly cold. Roads were practically impassable, so that one hardly ever saw anybody from another village. It must have been boredom as much as anything that led to the practice of witch-hunts as the sole sport by which winter evenings could be enlivened.","The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason.","Industry, sobriety, willingness to work long hours for distant advantages, even submissiveness to authority, all these reappear; moreover authority still represents the will of the Ruler of the Universe, who, however, is now called by a new name, Dialectical Materialism.","Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting fairy tales. It is not good either to forget the questions that philosophy asks, or to persuade ourselves that we have found indubitable answers to them. To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in","Auch wenn alle einer Meinung sind, k\xf6nnen alle unrecht haben.","I reflected that the value of a work of art has no relation whatever to the pleasure it gives; indeed, the more I have dwelt upon the subject, the more I have come to prize austerity rather than luxuriance.","Authoritative education, we may add, produces the slave type as well as the despotic type, since it leads to the feeling that the only possible relation between two human beings who cooperate is that in which one issues orders and the other obeys them.","I think I could turn and live with animals, they\u2019re so placid and self-contain\u2019d, I stand and look at them long and long. They do not sweat and whine about their condition, They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins, They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God, Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owing things, Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago, Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth. \u2014Walt Whitman","Science tells us what we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive to many things of very great importance","There was a very general development, first from monarchy to aristocracy, then to an alternation of tyranny and democracy.","Science tells us what we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive to many things of very great importance. Theology, on the other hand, induces a dogmatic belief that we have knowledge where in fact we have ignorance, and by doing so generates a kind of impertinent insolence towards the universe.","Men like power so long as they believe in their own competence to handle the business in question, but when they know themselves incompetent they prefer to follow a leader.","To a great extent fatigue in such cases is due to worry, and worry could be prevented by a better philosophy of life and a little more mental discipline. Most men and women are very deficient in control over their thoughts. I mean by this that they cannot cease to think about worrying topics at times when no action can be taken in regard to them.","The desires of an individual can be collected into groups, each group constituting what some psychologists call a \u2018sentiment\u2019. There will be\u2014to take politically important sentiments\u2014love of home, of family, of country, love of power, love of enjoyment, and so on; there will also be sentiments of aversion, such as fear of pain, laziness, dislike of foreigners, hatred of alien creeds, and so on. A man\'s sentiments at any given moment are a complicated product of his nature, his past history, and his present circumstances. Each sentiment, in so far as it is one which many men can gratify cooperatively better than singly, will, given opportunity, generate one or more organisations designed for its gratification. Take, for example, family sentiment. This has given rise, or has helped to give rise, to organisations for housing, education, and life insurance, which are matters in which the interests of different families are in harmony.","Religion is based, I think, primarily and mainly upon fear. It is partly the terror of the unknown and partly, as I have said, the wish to feel that you have a kind of elder brother who will stand by you in all your troubles and disputes. Fear is the basis of the whole thing -- fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand.","It must be admitted, for the reasons already stated, that logical principles are known to us, and cannot be themselves proved by experience, since all proof presupposes them. In this, therefore, which was the most important point of the controversy, the rationalists were in the right.On the other hand, even that part of our knowledge which is logically independent of experience (in the sense that experience cannot prove it) is yet elicited and caused by experience.","if you sympathise with everybody it comes to much the same as sympathising with none,","The cities, which had been the bearers of culture, were especially hard hit; substantial citizens, in large numbers, fled to escape the tax-collector. It was not till after the death of Plotinus that order was re-established and the Empire temporarily saved by the vigorous measures of Diocletian and Constantine. Of all this there is no mention in the works of Plotinus. He turned aside from the spectacle of ruin and misery in the actual world, to contemplate an eternal world of goodness and beauty. In this he was in harmony with all the most serious men of his age. To all of them, Christians and pagans alike, the world of practical affairs seemed to offer no hope, and only the Other World seemed worthy of allegiance. To the Christian, the Other World was the Kingdom of","Every proposition, true or false\u2014so the present theory contends\u2014ascribes a predicate to a subject, and\u2014what is a corollary from the above\u2014there is only one subject. The consequences of this doctrine are so strange, that I cannot believe they have been realized by those who maintain it. The theory is in fact self-contradictory.","The principle we are examining may be called the principle of induction, and its two parts may be stated as follows:(a) When a thing of a certain sort A has been found to be associated with a thing of a certain other sort B, and has never been found dissociated from a thing of the sort B, the greater the number of cases in which A and B have been associated, the greater is the probability that they will be associated in a fresh case in which one of them is known to be present;(b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of association will make the probability of a fresh association nearly a certainty, and will make it approach certainty without limit.","Whenever there is acute danger, the impulse of most people is to seek out Authority and submit to it; at such moments, few would dream of revolution. When war breaks out, people have similar feelings towards the Government.","I feel a real and solid pleasure when anybody points out a fallacy in any of my views, because I care much less about my opinions than about their being true.","Todo homem, aonde quer que v\xe1, est\xe1 envolto por uma nuvem de convic\xe7\xf5es confortadoras, que se deslocam com ele como moscas em um dia de ver\xe3o.","For if the Absolute has predicates, then there are predicates; but the proposition \u201cthere are predicates is not one which the present theory can admit. We cannot escape by saying that the predicates merely qualify the Absolute; for the Absolute cannot be qualified by nothing, so that the proposition \u201cthere are predicates\u201d is logically prior to the proposition \u201cthe Absolute has predicates\u201d. Thus the theory itself demands, as its logical prius, a proposition without a subject and a predicate; moreover this proposition involves diversity, for even if there be only one predicate, this must be different from the one subject. Again, since there is a predicate, the predicate is an entity, and its predicability of the Absolute is a relation between it and the Absolute. Thus the very proposition which was to be non-relational turns out to be, after all, relational, and to express a relation which current philosophical language would describe as purely external.\u201d","The notion that a term can be modified arises from neglect to observe the eternal self-identity of all terms and all logical concepts, which alone form the constituents of propositions.* What is called modification consists merely in having at one time, but not at another, some specific relation to some other specific term; but the term which sometimes has and sometimes has not the relation in question must be unchanged, otherwise it would not be that term which had ceased to have the relation.","There are those who believe that almost any group of men, when once it has seized the machinery of the State, can, by means of propaganda, secure general acquiescence.","Must think for thyself instead of merely taking scraps from different people - that is what makes thy opinions so disjointed, because thee takes different opinions from different people, thinking the two subjects independent - but no two subjects are really independent,","One hundred and fifty years of science have proved more explosive than five thousand years of prescientific culture. It would be absurd to suppose that the explosive power of science is exhausted, or has even reached its maximum. It is far more likely that science will continue for centuries to come to produce more and more rapid changes.","The objections to religion are of two sorts -- intellectual and moral. The intellectual objection is that there is no reason to suppose any religion true; the moral objection is that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel than they are and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the moral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow.","All ancient empires suffered from revolts, often led by provincial governors; and even when no overt revolt occurred, local autonomy was almost unavoidable except when conquest was recent, and was apt, in the course of time, to develop into independence. No large State of antiquity was governed from the centre to nearly the same extent as is now customary; and the chief reason for this was lack of rapid mobility.","We might state the argument by which [idealists] support their view in some such way as this: \'Whatever can be thought of is an idea in the mind of the person thinking of it; therefore nothing can be thought of except ideas in minds; therefore anything else is inconceivable, and what is inconceivable cannot exist.","Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty, a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.","\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0641\u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u060c \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0644\u200c\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0632 \u0648

rapidity in the transmission of messages that is important, but also, and still more, the fact that messages travel faster than human beings. Until little over a hundred years ago, neither messages nor anything else could travel faster than a horse. A highwayman could escape to a neighbouring town, and reach it before the news of his crime. Nowadays, since news arrives first, escape is more difficult. In time of war all rapid means of communication are controlled by governments, and this greatly increases their power.","The empires of Attila and Genghis Khan were transitory; and the nations of Europe lost most of their possessions in the New World. But with modern technique most empires are fairly safe except against external attack, and revolution is only to be expected after defeat in war.","Thus every principle of simplicity urges us to adopt the natural view, that there really are objects other than ourselves and our sense-data which have an existence not dependent upon our perceiving them.","Like most of my generation, I was brought up on the saying: \\"Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.\\" Being a highly virtuous child, I believed all that I was told, and acquired a conscience which has kept me working hard down to the present moment.","After Justinian became Emperor: \\"He was a man of deep piety, which he signalized, two years after his accession, by closing the schools of philosophy in Athens, where paganism still reigned. The dispossessed philosophers betook themselves to Persia, where the king received them kindly. But they were shocked-- more so, says Gibbon, than became philosophers-- by the Persian practices of polygamy and incest, so they returned home again, and faded into obscurity.\\" How tumultuous thou art, sixth century!","It follows, in the words of Epicurus, that \u201cDeath is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.","The product of causes ... his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms, that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, that the whole temple of man\'s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins\u2014all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand ...","in countries which do not enjoy Mediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great public propaganda will be required to inaugurate it. I hope that, after reading the following pages, the leaders of the Y.M.C.A. will start a campaign to induce good young men to do nothing. If so, I shall not have lived in vain.","The same thing applies to the mind. We think and feel and act, but there is not, in addition to thoughts and feelings and actions, a bare entity, the mind or the soul, which does or suffers these occurrences. The mental capacity of a person is a continuity of habit and memory: there was yesterday one person whose feelings I can remember, and that person I regard as myself of yesterday; but, in fact, myself of yesterday was only certain mental occurrences which are now remembered and are regarded as part of the person who now recollects them. All that constitutes a person is a series of experiences connected by memory and by certain similarities of the sort we call habit.","The best we can do, according to Bradley, is to say things that are \u2018not intellectually corrigible\u2019\u2014further progress is only possible through a synthesis of thought and feeling, which, when achieved, will lead to our saying nothing. Ideas have degrees of truth, greater or less according to the stage at which they come in the dialectic.","while some aspects of history can be made more or less scientific, and while it is important to do this wherever it is possible, the material is too complex to be reduced to scientific laws at present, and probably for centuries to come.","Belief in blood and race is naturally associated with anti-Semitism. At the same time, the romantic outlook, partly because it is aristocratic, and partly because it prefers passion to calculation, has a vehement contempt for commerce and finance. It is thus led to proclaim an opposition to capitalism which is quite different from that of the socialist who represents the interest of the proletariat, since it is an opposition based on dislike of economic preoccupations, and strengthened by the suggestion that the capitalist world is governed by Jews. This point of view is expressed by Byron on the rare occasions when he condescends to notice anything so vulgar as economic power: Who hold the balance of the world? Who reign \u2003O\u2019er conquerors, whether royalist or liberal? Who rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain? \u2003(That make old Europe\u2019s journals squeak and gibber all.) Who keep the world, both Old and New, in pain \u2003Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all? The shade of Buonaparte\u2019s noble daring? Jew Rothschild, and his fellow Christian Baring. The verse is perhaps not very musical, but the sentiment is quite of our time, and has been re-echoed by all Byron\u2019s followers.","\u0414\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435

external interference, but aversion from some one form of control which the government thinks desirable\u2014prohibition, conscription, religious conformity, or what not. Sometimes such sentiments can be gradually overcome by propaganda and education, which can indefinitely weaken the desire for personal independence.","A stupid man\u2019s report of what a clever man says is never accurate, because he unconsciously translates what he hears into something that he can understand.","What\xa0can we do for the world while we live? Many men and women would wish to serve mankind, but they are perplexed and their power seems infinitesimal. Despair seizes them; those who have the strongest passion suffer most from the sense of impotence, and are most liable to spiritual ruin through lack of hope.","Ridicule, nominally amusing but really an expression of hostility, was the favourite weapon\u2014the worst possible, short of actual cruelty, in dealing with young people.","Many forces conspire to make for uniformity in modern communities\u2014schools, newspapers, cinema, radio, drill, etc. Density of population has the same effect. The position of momentary equilibrium between the sentiment of independence and the love of power tends, therefore, under modern conditions, to shift further and further in the direction of power, thus facilitating the creation and success of totalitarian States.","A man who has suffered some humiliation invents a theory that he is King of England, and develops all kinds of ingenious explanations of the fact that he is not treated with that respect which his exalted position demands. In this case, his delusion is one with which his neighbours do not sympathize, so they lock him up. But if, instead of asserting only his own greatness, he asserts the greatness of his nation or his class or his creed, he wins hosts of adherents, and becomes a political or religious leader, even if, to the impartial outsider, his views seem just as absurd as those found in asylums.","So long as small children could work in factories, they remained a source of livelihood to their parents until they died of overwork; but the Factory Acts put an end to this form of exploitation, in spite of the protests of those who lived on it. From being a means of livelihood, children came to be a financial burden. At this stage, contraceptives became known, and the fall in the birth-rate began. There","We see, surrounding the narrow raft illuminated by the flickering light of human comradeship, the dark ocean on whose rolling waves we toss for a brief hour; all the loneliness of humanity amid hostile forces is concentrated on the individual soul, which must struggle alone, with what of courage it can command, against the whole weight of a universe that cares nothing for its hopes and fears.

This is only one of countless ways in which education is designed, not to give true knowledge, but to make the people pliable to the will of their masters. Without an elaborate system of deceit in the elementary schools it would be impossible to preserve the camouflage of democracy.","Yo no nac\xed dichoso. De ni\xf1o, mi himno favorito era: \xabCansado del mundo y con el peso de mis pecados\xbb. A los cinco a\xf1os yo pensaba que si hab\xeda de vivir setenta no hab\xeda pasado a\xfan m\xe1s que la catorceava parte de mi vida vital, y me parec\xeda casi insoportable la enorme cantidad de aburrimiento que me aguardaba. En la adolescencia la vida me era odiosa, y estaba continuamente al borde del suicidio, del cual me libr\xe9 gracias al deseo de saber m\xe1s matem\xe1ticas. Hoy, por el contrario, gusto de la vida, y casi estoy por decir que cada a\xf1o que pasa la encuentro m\xe1s gustosa. Esto es debido, en parte, a haber descubierto cu\xe1les eran las cosas que deseaba m\xe1s y haber adquirido gradualmente muchas de ellas. En parte es debido tambi\xe9n a haberme desprendido, felizmente, de ciertos deseos (la adquisici\xf3n del conocimiento indudable acerca de algo) como esencialmente inasequibles. Pero en la mayor parte se debe a la preocupaci\xf3n, cada d\xeda menor, de m\xed mismo.","El budismo, el cristianismo y el marxismo deben su origen a individuos y ninguno de ellos podr\xeda haber surgido en un estado totalitario.

Ni lo mataron, ni quemaron sus libros, ni sus seguidores fueron liquidados. Tan s\xf3lo ha sido en los tiempos modernos, en verdad desde el final de la primera Guerra Mundial, cuando la persecuci\xf3n se ha convertido en un procedimiento cient\xedfico y eficiente.","Again: love is able to break down the hard shell of the ego, since it is a form of biological co\xf6peration in which the emotions of each are necessary to the fulfillment of the other\u2019s instinctive purposes.","Each impulse has its constitutional ministry of thought and knowledge and reflection, through which possible conflicts of impulses are foreseen, and temporary impulses are controlled by the unifying impulse which may be called wisdom. In this way education destroys the crudity of instinct, and increases through knowledge the wealth and variety of the individual\'s contacts with the outside world, making him no longer an isolated fighting unit, but a citizen of the universe, embracing distant countries, remote regions of space, and vast stretches of past and future within the circle of his interests. It is this simultaneous softening in the insistence of desire and enlargement of its scope that is the chief moral end of education.","A filosofia, conforme entendo a palavra, \xe9 algo intermedi\xe1rio entre a teologia e a ci\xeancia.

Theology, on the other hand, induces a dogmatic belief that wehave knowledge where in fact we have ignorance","Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth\'s surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid.","Any organization, however idealistic its professed aims, may degenerate into a tyranny unless the public firmly retains in its own hands some effective means of controlling leaders. Democracy is the only means so far discovered, but it will not be a completely effective means until it has been broadened and extended to economic regions from which as yet it is excluded. The essential data on this whole subject can only be obtained from a study of history.","Having come to a sound egoistic decision by the help of the unconscious, a man proceeds to invent, or adopt from others, a set of high-sounding phrases showing how he is pursuing the public good at immense personal sacrifice. Anybody who believes that these phrases give his real reasons must suppose him quite incapable of judging evidence, since the supposed public good is not going to result from his action. In this case a man appears less rational than he is; what is still more curious, the irrational part of him is conscious and the rational part unconscious. It is this trait in our characters that has made the English and Americans so successful.","As soon as absolute truth is supposed to be contained in the saying of a certain man, there is a body of experts to interpret his sayings, and these experts infallibly acquire power, since they hold the key to truth. like any other privileged caste, they use their power for their own advantage.","Our present predicament is due more than anything else to the fact that we have learnt to understand and control to a terrifying extent the forces of nature outside us, but not those that are embodied in ourselves.","I will say a few words about the connection of love and intellectual honesty. There are several different attitudes that may be adopted towards the spectacle of intolerable suffering. If you are a sadist, you may find pleasure in it; if you are completely detached, you may ignore it; if you are a sentamentalist, you may persuade yourself that it is not as bad as it seems; but if you feel genuine compassion you will try to apprehend the evil truly in order to be able to cure it. The sentimentalist will say that you are coldly intellectual, and that, if you really minded the sufferings of others, you could not be so scientific about them. The sentimentalist will claim to have a tenderer heart than yours, and will show it by letting the suffering continue rather than suffer himself.","It may be laid down as a general rule to which there are few exceptions that, when people are mistaken as to what is to their own interest, the course that they believe to be wise is more harmful to others than the course that really is wise. Therefore anything that makes people better judges of their own interest does good.","If there is to be toleration in the world, one of the things taught in schools must be the habit of weighing evidence, and the practice of not giving full assent to propositions which there is no reason to believe true. For example, the art of reading the newspapers should be taught. The schoolmaster should select some incident which happened a good many years ago, and roused political passions in its day. 41 He should then read to the school children what was said by the newspapers on one side, what was said by those on the other, and some impartial account of what really happened. He should show how, from the biased account of either side, a practised reader could infer what really happened, and he should make them understand that everything in newspapers is more or less untrue. The cynical scepticism which would result from this teaching would make the children in later life immune from those appeals to idealism by which decent people are induced to further the schemes of scoundrels","a priori knowledge such as mathematics or logic is general, whereas all experience is particular.","But in the \u2019nineties young men desired something more sweeping and passionate, more bold and less bland.","The utility of information is admitted practically as well as theoretically; without a literate population a modern State is impossible. But the utility of intelligence is admitted only theoretically, not practically; it is not desired that ordinary people should think for themselves, because it is felt that people who think for themselves are awkward to manage and cause administrative difficulties. Only the guardians, in Plato\u2019s language, are to think; the rest are to obey, or to follow leaders like a herd of sheep.","Ibsen, Strindberg, and Nietzsche were angry men\u2014not primarily angry about this or that, but just angry. And so they each found an outlook on life that justified anger. The young admired their passion, and found in it an outlet for their own feelings of revolt against parental authority. The assertion of freedom seemed sufficiently noble to justify violence; the violence duly ensued, but freedom was lost in the process.","Pragmatism emphasizes the irrationality of opinion, and psycho-analysis emphasizes the irrationality of conduct. Both have led many people to the view that there is no such thing as an ideal rationality to which opinion and conduct might with advantage conform. It would seem to follow that, if you and I hold different opinions, it is useless to appeal to argument, or to seek the arbitrament of an impartial outsider; there is nothing for us to do but fight it out, by the methods of rhetoric, advertisement, or warfare, according to the degree of our financial and military strength. I believe such an outlook to be very dangerous, and in the long run, fatal to civilization.","I have frequently experienced myself the mood in which I felt that all is vanity; I have emerged from it not by any philosophy, but owing to some imperative necessity of action.","Following Locke\'s doctrine that the mind is a tabula rasa, Helvetius considered the differences between individuals entirely due to differences of education: in every individual, his talents and his virtues are the effect of his instruction.","it is here that Spinoza is in the right\u2014a life dominated by a single passion is a narrow life, incompatible with every kind of wisdom.","In Labor movements generally, success through violence can hardly be expected except in circumstances where success without violence is attainable.","To begin with rationality in opinion: I should define it merely as the habit of taking account of all relevant evidence in arriving at a belief. Where certainty is unattainable, a rational man will give most weight to the most probable opinion, while retaining others, which have an appreciable probability, in his mind as hypotheses which subsequent evidence may show to be preferable.","He had a great intellectual influence upon my generation, though in retrospect I do not think it was a very good one.","But in this latter event the cause probably lies in a lack of self-confidence due to early misfortune. The man who feels himself unloved may take various attitudes as a result. He may make desperate efforts to win affection, probably by means of exceptional acts of kindness. In this, however, he is very likely to be unsuccessful, since the motive of the kindnesses is easily perceived by their beneficiaries, and human nature is so constructed that it gives affection most readily to those who seem least to demand it. The man, therefore, who endeavors to purchase affection by benevolent actions becomes disillusioned by experience of human ingratitude. It never occurs to him that the affection which he is trying to buy is of far more value than the material benefits which he offers as its price, and yet the feeling that this is so is at the basis of his actions.","Next, he points out that good men are better to live among than bad men, and therefore he cannot be so foolish as to corrupt his fellow-citizens intentionally; but if unintentionally, then Meletus should instruct him, not prosecute him.","Go out into the world; become a pirate, a king in Borneo, a laborer in Soviet Russia; give yourself an existence in which the satisfaction of elementary physical needs will occupy almost all your energies. I do not recommend this course of action to every one, but only to those who suffer from the disease which Mr. Krutch diagnoses. I believe that after some years of such an existence, the ex-intellectual will find that in spite of his efforts he can no longer refrain from writing, and when this time comes his writing will not seem to him futile.\u201d","The objection to propaganda is not only its appeal to unreason, but still more the unfair advantage which it gives to the rich and powerful. Equality of opportunity among opinions is essential if there is to be real freedom of thought; and equality of opportunity among opinions can only be secured by elaborate laws directed to that end, which there is no reason to expect to see enacted. The cure is not to be sought primarily in such laws, but in better education and a more sceptical public opinion.","Io non credo che la scienza per s\xe9 sia fonte adeguata di felicit\xe0, n\xe9 credo che la mia mentalit\xe0 scientifica abbia contribuito granch\xe9 alla mia propria felicit\xe0.

The Government, being in doubt as to the truth of the new religion, ordered one of the courtiers to adopt it experimentally; if he prospered more than the others, the religion was to be adopted universally. This is the method (with modifications to suit modern times) which the pragmatists advocate in regard to all religious controversies.","Suffering to the criminal can never be justified by the notion of vindictive punishment.

One","If, in the name of Reason, you summon a man to alter his fundamental purposes\u2014to pursue, say, the general happiness rather than his own power\u2014you will fail, and you will deserve to fail, since Reason alone cannot determine the ends of life. And you will fail equally if you attack deep-seated prejudices while your argument is still open to question, or is so difficult that only men of science can see its force. But if you can prove, by evidence which is convincing to every sane man who takes the trouble to examine it, that you possess a means of facilitating the satisfaction of existing desires, you may hope, with a certain degree of confidence, that men will ultimately believe what you say. This, of course, involves the proviso that the existing desires which you can satisfy are those of men who have power or are capable of acquiring it.","It is in the moments when the mind is most active and the fewest things are forgotten that the most intense joys are experienced.","But the whole theory rests, if I am not mistaken, upon neglect of the fundamental distinction between an idea and its object. Misled by neglect of being, people have supposed that what does not exist is nothing. Seeing that numbers, relations, and many other objects of thought, do not exist outside the mind, they have supposed that the thoughts in which we think of these entities actually create their own objects. Every one except a philosopher can see the difference between a post and my idea of a post, but few see the difference between the number 2 and my idea of the number 2. Yet the distinction is as necessary in one case as in the other. The argument that 2 is mental requires that 2 should be essentially an existent. But in that case it would be particular, and it would be impossible for 2 to be in two minds, or in one mind at two times. Thus 2 must be in any case an entity, which will have being even if it is in no mind.* But further, there are reasons for denying that 2 is created by the thought which thinks it. For, in this case, there could never be two thoughts until some one thought so; hence what the person so thinking supposed to be two thoughts would not have been two, and the opinion, when it did arise, would be erroneous. And applying the same doctrine to 1; there cannot be one thought until some one thinks so. Hence Adam\u2019s first thought must have been concerned with the number 1; for not a single thought could precede this thought. In short, all knowledge must be recognition, on pain of being mere delusion; Arithmetic must be discovered in just the same sense in which Columbus discovered the West Indies, and we no more create numbers than he created the Indians. The number 2 is not purely mental, but is an entity which may be thought of. Whatever can be thought of has being, and its being is a precondition, not a result, of its being thought of.","What Power does present is something perhaps equally rare and surely as useful\u2014an abundance of sheer good sense and plain speaking. To read it at the close of this troubled century is to be struck by the prescience of its warnings concerning the dangers of the control of media and propaganda, the shrewdness of its appreciation of the mass appeal of fascism, nazism, and Stalinism, and the wisdom of its admonitions concerning the spread of violence and intolerance even in democratic states. Power thus remains a book whose blend of rare good sense and uncommon wisdom speaks to us with as much eloquence and insight as ever.","We can be sure, he [Kant] says, that anything we shall ever experience must show the characteristics affirmed of it in our a priori knowledge, because these characteristics are due to our own nature, and therefore nothing can ever come into our experience without acquiring these characteristics.","The tendency, which exists wherever industrialism is well developed, for trusts and monopolies to control all industry, leads to a diminution of the number of possible employers, so that it becomes easier and easier to keep secret black books by means of which any one not subservient to the great corporations can be starved.

From the standpoint of liberty, it makes no difference to a man whether his only possible employer is the State or a Trust.","Religion is based, I think, primarily and mainly upon fear.....Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion has gone hand-in-hand.","Imagination is the goad that forces human beings into restless exertion after their primary needs have been satisfied.","\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0649 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0645\u062d \u0628\u0646\u0642\u062f \u0623\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u062f\u0629 \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u064a\u064f\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0627\u0626\u0642\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629.","The drunkard who sees snakes does not imagine, afterwards, that he has had a revelation of a reality hidden from others [\u2026].

The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.","While animals are content with existence and reproduction, men desire also to expand, and their desires in this respect are limited only by what imagination suggests as possible.","If it is the devil that tempts the young to enjoy themselves, is it not the same personage that persuades the old to condemn their enjoyment? And is not condemnation perhaps merely a form of excitement appropriate to old age?","Gradually, however, subjectivism invaded men\'s feelings as well as their doctrines. Science was no longer cultivated, and only virtue was thought important. Virtue, as conceived by Plato, involved all that was then possible in the way of mental achievement; but in later centuries it came to be thought of, increasingly, as involving only the virtuous will, and not a desire to understand the physical world or improve the world of human institutions. Christianity, in its ethical doctrines, was not free from this defect, although in practice belief in the importance of spreading the Christian faith gave a practicable object for moral activity, which was no longer confined to the perfecting of self. Plotinus is both an end and a beginning--an end as regards the Greeks, a beginning as regards Christendom. To the ancient world, weary with centuries of disappointment, exhausted by despair, his doctrine might be acceptable, but could not be stimulating. To the cruder barbarian world, where superabundant energy needed to be restrained and regulated rather than stimulated, what could penetrate in his teaching was beneficial, since the evil to be combated was not languor but brutality. The work of transmitting what could survive of his philosophy was performed by the Christian philosophers of the last","It may be laid down broadly that irrationalism, i.e. disbelief in objective fact, arises almost always from the desire to assert something for which there is no evidence, or to deny something for which there is very good evidence.","The lunatic who believes he is a poached egg, is to be condemned solely on the ground that he is in a minority. Or rather, since we must not assume democracy, on the ground that the government disagrees with him.","Political dynasties have disappeared, but economic dynasties survive. I am not at the moment arguing either for or against this different treatment of the two forms of power; I am merely pointing out that it exists, and that most men are unconscious of it. When you consider how natural it seems to us that the power over the lives of others resulting from great wealth should be hereditary, you will understand better how men like Sir Robert Filmer could take the same view as regards the power of kings, and how important was the innovation represented by men who thought as Locke did.","The Social Contract became the Bible of most of the leaders in the French Revolution, but no doubt, as is the fate of Bibles, it was not carefully read and was still less understood by many of its disciples. It reintroduced the habit of metaphysical abstractions among the theorists of democracy, and by its doctrine of the general will it made possible the mystic identification of a leader with his people, which has no need of confirmation by so mundane an apparatus as the ballot-box. Much of its philosophy could be appropriated by Hegel5 in his defence of the Prussian autocracy. Its first-fruits in practice were the reign of Robespierre; the dictatorships of Russia and Germany (especially the latter) are in part an outcome of Rousseau\'s teaching. What further triumphs the future has to offer to his ghost I do not venture to predict.","It has been finely said that if Judaism as a religion had perished under Antiochus, the seed-bed of Christianity would have been lacking; and thus the blood of the Maccabean martyrs, who saved Judaism, ultimately became the seed of the Church. Therefore as not only Christendom but also Islam derive their monotheism from a Jewish source, it may well be that the world to-day owes the very existence of monotheism both in the East and in the West to the Maccabees.","If the law of gravitation be regarded as universal, the point may be stated as follows. The laws of motion require to be stated by reference to what have been called kinetic axes: these are in reality axes having no absolute acceleration and no absolute rotation. It is asserted, for example, when the third law is combined with the notion of mass, that, if m, m\' be the masses of two particles between which there is a force, the component accelerations of the two particles due to this force are in the ratio m2 : m1. But this will only be true if the accelerations are measured relative to axes which themselves have no acceleration. We cannot here introduce the centre of mass, for, according to the principle that dynamical facts must be, or be derived from, observable data, the masses, and therefore the centre of mass, must be obtained from the acceleration, and not vice vers\xe2. Hence any dynamical motion, if it is to obey the laws of motion, must be referred to axes which are not subject to any forces. But, if the law of gravitation be accepted, no material axes will satisfy this condition. Hence we shall have to take spatial axes, and motions relative to these are of course absolute motions. 465. In order to avoid this conclusion, C. Neumann* assumes as an essential part of the laws of motion the existence, somewhere, of an absolutely rigid \u201cBody Alpha, by reference to which all motions are to be estimated. This suggestion misses the essence of the discussion, which is (or should be) as to the logical meaning of dynamical propositions, not as to the way in which they are discovered. It seems sufficiently evident that, if it is necessary to invent a fixed body, purely hypothetical and serving no purpose except to be fixed, the reason is that what is really relevant is a fixed place, and that the body occupying it is irrelevant. It is true that Neumann does not incur the vicious circle which would be involved in saying that the Body Alpha is fixed, while all motions are relative to it; he asserts that it is rigid, but rightly avoids any statement as to its rest or motion, which, in his theory, would be wholly unmeaning. Nevertheless, it seems evident that the question whether one body is at rest or in motion must have as good a meaning as the same question concerning any other body; and this seems sufficient to condemn Neumann\u2019s suggested escape from absolute motion.\u201d","Many times it has happened: Lifted out of the body into myself; becoming external to all other things and self-encentered; beholding a marvellous beauty; then, more than ever, assured of community with the loftiest order; enacting the noblest life, acquiring identity with the divine; stationing within It by having attained that activity; poised above whatsoever in the Intellectual is less than the Supreme: yet, there comes the moment of descent from intellection to reasoning, and after that sojourn in the divine, I ask myself how it happens that I can now be descending, and how did the Soul ever enter into my body, the Soul which even within the body, is the high thing it has shown itself to be. \xe2\u20ac\xa1 ____________________","Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews had no part in the culture of Christian countries, and were too severely persecuted to be able to make contributions to civilization, beyond supplying capital for the building of cathedrals and such enterprises. It was only among the Mohammedans, at that period, that Jews were treated humanely, and were able to pursue philosophy and enlightened speculation. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Mohammedans were more civilized and more humane than the Christians. Christians persecuted Jews, especially at times of religious excitement; the Crusades were associated with appalling pogroms. In Mohammedan countries, on the contrary, Jews at most times were not in any way ill treated. Especially in Moorish Spain, they contributed to learning; Maimonides (1135\u20131204), who was born at Cordova, is regarded by some as the source of much of Spinoza\u2019sphilosophy. (..) Mohammedan civilization in its great days was admirable in the arts and in many technical ways, but it showed no capacity for independent speculation in theoretical matters. Its importance, which must not be under-rated, is as a transmitter. Between ancient and modern European civilization, the dark ages intervened. The Mohammedans and the Byzantines, while lacking the intellectual energy required for innovation, preserved the apparatus of civilization\u2014education, books, and learned leisure.

Fatigue produces the illusion that only rest is needed for happiness; but when men have rested for a time, boredom drives them to renewed activity. For this reason, a happy life must be one in which there is activity. If it is also to be a useful life, the activity ought to be as far as possible creative, not merely predatory or defensive. But creative activity requires imagination and originality, which are apt to be subversive of the\xa0status quo. At present, those who have power dread a disturbance of the\xa0status quo, lest their unjust privileges should be taken away.

Men of science, for the most part, are willing to condemn immediate data as \\"merely subjective,\\" while yet maintaining the truth of the physics inferred from those data. But such an attitude, though it may be *capable* of justification, obviously stands in need of it; and the only justification possible must be one which exhibits matter as a logical construction from sense-data\u2015unless, indeed, there were some wholly *a priori* principle by which unknown entities could be inferred from such as are known. It is therefore necessary to find some way of bridging the gulf between the world of physics and the world of sense, and it is this problem which will occupy us in the present lecture. Physicists appear to be unconscious of the gulf, while psychologists, who are conscious of it, have not the mathematical knowledge required for spanning it. The problem is difficult, and I do not know its solution in detail. All that I can hope to do is to make the problem felt, and to indicate the kind of methods by which a solution is to be sought.\\"\u2015from_Our Knowledge of the External World_, p. 107.","...diktat\xf6rl\xfc\u011f\xfcn ba\u015flang\u0131\xe7taki ama\xe7lar\u0131nda iyi diye ne varsa despotizmin ka\xe7\u0131n\u0131lmaz mant\u0131\u011f\u0131 dolay\u0131s\u0131yla bunlar\u0131n t\xfcm\xfc yok olacak ve dikta iktidar\u0131n\u0131 koruma amac\u0131, devlet mekanizmas\u0131n\u0131n yal\u0131n amac\u0131 olarak gitgide daha g\xfc\xe7l\xfc bir bi\xe7imde ortaya \xe7\u0131kacakt\u0131r...","Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy.

Amid such a world, if anywhere, our ideals henceforward must find a home. That Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man\'s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins--all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul\'s habitation henceforth be safely built.","It is of course possible that all or any of our beliefs may be mistaken, and therefore all ought to be held with at least some slight element of doubt. But we cannot have reason to reject a belief except on the ground of some other belief. Hence, by organizing our instinctive beliefs and their consequences, by considering which among them is most possible, if necessary, to modify or abandon, we can arrive, on the basis of accepting as our sole data what we instinctively believe, at an orderly systematic organization of our knowledge, in which, though the possibility of error remains, its likelihood is diminished by the interrelation of the parts and by the critical scrutiny which has preceded acquiescence.","YURT - Bir\xe7ok zamanlarda ve bir\xe7ok yerlerde yurtseverlik tutkulu bir inan\xe7 olagelmi\u015f ve en iyi kafalar bu inanc\u0131 tamam\u0131yla onaylam\u0131\u015flard\u0131r.

The third is: don\'t expect others to take as much interest in you as you do yourself. And the fourth is: don\'t imagine that most people give enough thought to you to have any desire to persecute you.","Persecution mania is always rooted in a too exaggerated conception of our own merits.","When admitting that nothing is certain, one must also, I think, admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others.","The happy man is the man who lives objectively, who has free affections and wide interests, who secures his happiness through these interests and affections and through the fact that they, in turn, make him an object of interest and affections to many others.","It has been argued that we have reason to know that the future will resemble the past, because what was the future has constantly become the past, and has always been found to resemble the past, so that we really have experience of the future, namely of times which were formerly future, which we may call past futures. But such an argument really begs the very question at issue. We have experience of past futures, but not of future futures, and the question is: Will future futures resemble past futures? This question is not to be answered by an argument which starts from past futures alone. We have therefore still to seek for some principle which shall enable us to know that the future will follow the same laws as the past. The","If our logic is to find the common world intelligible, it must not be hostile, but must be inspired by a genuine acceptance such as is not usually to be found among metaphysicians.","Another not uncommon victim of persecution mania is a certain type of philanthropist, who is always doing good to people against their will, and is amazed and horrified that they display no gratitude. Our motives in doing good are seldom as pure as we imagine them to be. Love of power is insidious; it has many disguises, and is often the source of the pleasure we derive from doing what we believe to be good to other people.","Los capitalistas, militaristas y eclesi\xe1sticos cooperan en la educaci\xf3n, porque el poder de todos ellos depende del prevalecimiento del sentimentalismo y de la excepcionalidad del juicio cr\xedtico.","I think that, if we are to feel at home in the world after the present war, we shall have to admit Asia to equality in our thoughts, not only politically, but culturally.

Light and heat and sound are all due to wave-motions, which travel from the body emitting them to the person who sees light or feels heat or hears sound.","It is in the moments when the mind is most active and the fewest things are forgotten that the most intense joys are experienced. This indeed is one of the best touchstones of happiness. The happiness that requires intoxication of no matter what sort is a spurious and unsatisfying kind. The happiness that is genuinely satisfying is accompanied by the fullest exercise of our faculties, and the fullest realization of the world in which we live.","Of Bergson\'s theory that intellect is a purely practical faculty developed in the struggle for survival, and not a source of true beliefs, we may say, first, that it is only through intellect that we know of the struggle for survival and of the biological ancestry of man: if the intellect is misleading, the whole of this merely inferred history is presumably untrue. If, on the other hand, we agree with M. Bergson in thinking that evolution took place as Darwin believed, then it is not only intellect, but all our faculties, that have been developed under the stress of practical utility. Intuition is seen at its best where it is directly useful\u2014for example, in regard to other people\'s characters and dispositions. Bergson apparently holds that capacity for this kind of knowledge is less explicable by the struggle for existence than, for example, capacity for pure mathematics. Yet","Los moralistas puritanos han insistido siempre en la importancia de la voluntad en los tiempos modernos, aunque en un principio insist\xedan m\xe1s a\xfan en la fe.

But in so far as time consists in an order of before and after, there is no need to make such a distinction; the time-order which events seem to have is, so far as we can see, the same as the time-order which they do have.","Can Religion Cure Our Troubles:Mankind is in mortal peril, and fear now, as in the past, is inclining men to seek refuge in God. Throughout the West there is a very general revival of religion. Nazis and Communists dismissed Christianity and did things which we deplore. It is easy to conclude that the repudiation of Christianity by Hitler and the Soviet Government is at least in part the cause of our troubles and that if the world returned to Christianity, our international problems would be solved. I believe this to be a complete delusion born of terror. And I think it is a dangerous delusion because it misleads men whose thinking might otherwise be fruitful and thus stands in the way of a valid solution.The question involved is not concerned only with the present state of the world. It is a much more general question, and one which has been debated for many centuries. It is the question whether societies can practise a sufficient modicum of morality if they are not helped by dogmatic religion. I do not myself think that the dependence of morals upon religion is nearly as close as religious people believe it to be. I even think that some very important virtues are more likely to be found among those who reject religious dogmas than among those who accept them. I think this applies especially to the virtue of truthfulness or intellectual integrity. I mean by intellectual integrity the habit of deciding vexed questions in accordance with the evidence, or of leaving them undecided where the evidence is inconclusive. This virtue, though it is underestimated by almost all adherents of any system of dogma, is to my mind of the very greatest social importance and far more likely to benefit the world than Christianity or any other system of organised beliefs.","\u03a5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf \u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf: \u03c4\u03bf \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2. \u03a4\u03bf \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf, \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u2019 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc.","Entre todas las formas de cautela, lacautela en el amor es, posiblemente, la m\xe1s letal para la aut\xe9ntica felicidad.","Draw significant conclusions slowly.","Thus we find that, although the relations of physical objects have all sorts of knowable properties, derived from their correspondence with the relations of sense-data, the physical objects themselves remain unknown in their intrinsic nature, so far at least as can be discovered by means of the senses.","No man need fear that by making himself rational he will make his life dull. On the contrary, since rationality consists in the main of internal harmony, the man who achieves it is freer in his contemplation of the world and in the use of his energies to achieve external purposes that is the man who is perpetually hampered by inward conflicts. Nothing is so dull as to be encased in self, nothing so exhilarating as to have attention and energy directed outwards.","All human activity is prompted by desire. There is a wholly fallacious theory advanced by some earnest moralists to the effect that it is possible to resist desire in the interests of duty and moral principle. I say this is fallacious, not because no man ever acts from a sense of duty, but because duty has no hold on him unless he desires to be dutiful. If you wish to know what men will do, you must know not only, or principally, their material circumstances, but rather the whole system of their desires with their relative strengths.","Having, by a time of very intense concentration, planted the problem in my subconsciousness, it would germinate underground until, suddenly, the solution emerged with blinding clarity, so that it only remained to write down what had appeared as if in a revelation.","I think the essence of wisdom is emancipation, as far as possible, from the tyranny of the here and now.","Vanity is a motive of immense potency. Anyone who has much to do with children knows how they are constantly performing some antic, and saying \\"Look at me.\\" \\"Look at me\\" is one of the most fundamental desires of the human heart. It can take innumerable forms, from buffoonery to the pursuit of posthumous fame.","And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

And when, as must happen in conventional families, they find that their parents have lied, they lose confidence in them, and feel justified in lying to them.","one should not regard anything that one accepts as quite certain, but only as probable in a greater or a less degree.

To defy with Promethean constancy a hostile universe, to keep its evil always in view, always actively hated, to refuse no pain that the malice of Power can invent, appears to be the duty of all who will not bow before the inevitable. But indignation is still a bondage, for it compels our thoughts to be occupied with an evil world; and in the fierceness of desire from which rebellion springs there is a kind of self-assertion which it is necessary for the wise to overcome. Indignation is a submission of our thoughts, but not of our desires; the Stoic freedom in which wisdom consists is found in the submission of our desires, but not of our thoughts. From the submission of our desires springs the virtue of resignation; from the freedom of our thoughts springs the whole world of art and philosophy, and the vision of beauty by which, at last, we half reconquer the reluctant world.","Descartes (1596-1650), the founder of modern philosophy, invented a method which may still be used with profit--the method of systematic doubt.","He was recommended to the \u201cCaliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf as a man capable of making an analysis of the works of Aristotle.

What is amiss is the mere existence of a creed. As soon as income, position, and power are dependent upon acceptance of no matter what creed, intellectual honesty is imperiled. Men will tell themselves that a formal assent is justified by the good which it will enable them to do. They fail to realize that, in those whose mental life has any vigor, loss of complete intellectual integrity puts an end to the power of doing good, by producing gradually in all directions an inability to see truth simply. The strictness of party discipline has introduced the same evil in politics; there, because the evil is comparatively new, it is visible to many who think it unimportant as\xa0regards the Church. But the evil is greater as regards the Church, because religion is of more importance than politics, and because it is more necessary that the exponents of religion should be wholly free from taint.","All the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noon-day brightnessof human genius, are destined to extinctionin the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man\'s achievementmust inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins","...although our age far surpasses all previous ages in knowledge, there has been no correlative increase in wisdom.","Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them.

But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.","Acquaintance with objects essentially consists in a relation between the mind and something other than the mind; it is this that constitutes the mind\'s power of knowing things.

Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habits; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. It sees man, a feeble speck, surrounded by unfathomable depths of silence; yet bears itself proudly, as unmoved as if it were lord of the universe. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man. But if thought is to become the possession of many, not the privilege of the few, we must have done with fear.

The same thing, of course, happened in the relations of men and women. It was the duty of the wives to submit to husbands, not of husbands to submit to wives. The only basis for this view was that if wives could be induced to accept it, it saved trouble for their husbands. \'The man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man; neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man\' (I Cor. xi. 8,9). I defy anyone to find any basis for this view, except that men have stronger muscles than women.","is clear that human knowledge must always be content to accept some terms as intelligible without definition,","I was encouraged in my transition to philosophy by a certain disgust with mathematics, resulting from too much concentration and too much absorption in the sort of skill that is needed in examinations.

When, at the end of my first three years at Cambridge, I emerged from my last mathematical examination I swore that I would never look at mathematics again and sold all my mathematical books.","I must, before I die, find some means of saying the essential thing which is in me, which I have not yet said, a thing which is neither love nor hate nor pity nor scorn but the very breath of life, shining and coming from afar, which will link into human life the immensity, the frightening, wondrous and implacable forces of the non-human.","tener fe, es decir, tener una convicci\xf3n que no puede ser debilitada por la evidencia contraria.","A pol\xedtica \xe9 em grande parte dominada por estribilhos moralistas desprovidos de qualquer verdade.","I shall never lose the sense of being a ghost.","kings are led astray by two causes: pride, and reliance upon an inner group which has lost its power of command.

The other cause for the decay of monarchy is more important.

He will inquire whether it does any harm or whether, on the contrary, the belief that it is sinful does harm. And he will find that, especially in what concerns sex, our current morality contains a very great deal of which the origin is purely superstitious. He will find also that this superstition, like that of the Aztecs, involves needless cruelty, and would be swept away if people were actuated by kindly feelings towards their neighbors.

The third of these desires is sometimes absent: some men who have been great have been without the \u201clast infirmity, and have been content with their own sense of success, or merely with the joy of difficult effort.

But although this is not logically impossible, there is no reason whatever to suppose that it is true; and it is, in fact, a less simple hypothesis, viewed as a means of accounting for the facts of our own life, than the common-sense hypothesis that there really are objects independent of us, whose action on us causes our sensations.","A few societies have perished from","He is thus led, in practice, to regarding absence of pain, rather than presence of pleasure, as the wise man\u2019s goal.VI","The chief importance of knowledge by description is that it enables us to pass beyond the limits of our private experience.

I do not say that I can offer as much happiness as is to be obtained from drink or drugs or amassing great wealth by swindling widows and orphans. It is not the happiness of the individual convert that concerns me; it is the happiness of mankind. If you genuinely desire the happiness of mankind, certain forms of ignoble personal happiness are not open to you. If your child is ill, and you are a conscientious parent, you accept medical diagnosis, however doubtful and discouraging; if you accept the cheerful opinion of a quack and your child consequently dies, you are not excused by the pleasantness of belief in the quack while it lasted.","\u041c\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438, \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438 \u0441 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438: \\"\u0412\u044b \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043b\u0438?\\", \u0430 \u043e\u043d \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043b: \\"\u041d\u0435\u0442, \u044f \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043b\\". \u041a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u044b \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438, \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0451\u043a \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: \\"\u041d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u043e \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043c, \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0438\u043c\u044b\u043c \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439\\". \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e \u043e\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u043e \\"\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f\\", \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \\"\u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f\\".","WAR AS AN INSTITUTION In spite of the fact that most nations at most times, are at peace, war is one of the permanent institutions of all free communities, just as Parliament is one of our permanent institutions in spite of the fact that it is not always sitting.

In a moment imagination and instinct travel back through the centuries, and the wild man of the woods emerges from the mental prison in which he has been confined. This is the deeper part of the psychology of the war fever.","The general aim of the democrat is to substitute government by general assent for government by force, but this requires a population that has undergone a certain kind of training. Given a nation divided into two nearly equal portions which hate each other and long to fly at each other\u2019s throats, the portion which is just less than half will not submit tamely to the domination of the other portion, nor will the portion which is just more than half show, in the moment of victory, the kind of moderation which might heal the breach.","self-consciousness is the source of all our knowledge of mental things.","The young, no doubt, make mistakes; but the old, when they try to think for them, make even greater mistakes.","There is no nonsense so arrant that it cannot be made the creed of the vast majority by adequate governmental action. Plato intended his Republic to be founded on a myth which he admitted to be absurd, but he was rightly confident that the populace could be induced to believe it.","Arist\xf3teles podia ter evitado o erro de pensar que as mulheres t\xeam menos dentes do que os homens simplesmente pedindo \xe0 Sra.

Such philosophers are called \'idealists\'.","A great many of the impulses which now lead nations to go to war are in themselves essential to any vigorous or progressive life. Without imagination and love of adventure a society soon becomes stagnant and begins to decay. Conflict, provided it is not destructive and brutal, is necessary in order to stimulate men\u2019s activities, and to secure the victory of what is living over what is dead or merely traditional.","the circumstances of men\u2019s lives do much to determine their philosophy, but, conversely, their philosophy does much to determine their circumstances","...is the argument from design. It sometimes takes a rather curious form; for instance, it is argued that rabbits have white tails in order to be easy to shoot. I do not know how rabbits would view that application. It is an easy argument to parody.","The youth who is capable of becoming a philosopher will be distinguished among his fellows as just and gentle, fond of learning, possessed of a good memory and a naturally harmonious mind.","Pero qu\xe9 pocos vivos piensan que tambi\xe9n ellos ser\xe1n alg\xfan d\xeda moribundos, que tambi\xe9n ellos buscar\xe1n simpat\xeda, aunque acabar\xe1n por encontrarse solos, en una soledad tan terrible y absoluta que la propia muerte parecer\xe1 una liberaci\xf3n.","It seems that sin is geographical.","I suspect that even the Universe, as considered by metaphysics, involves such a connexion with particulars. In logic, on the contrary, where we are concerned not merely with what does exist, but with whatever might or could exist or be, no reference to actual particulars is involved.","Usa-se a persegui\xe7\xe3o em teologia e n\xe3o na aritm\xe9tica, porque na aritm\xe9tica h\xe1 conhecimento, ao passo que na teologia s\xf3 h\xe1 opini\xf5es.

If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument.","It will be seen that there are various stages in the removal from acquaintance with particulars: there is Bismarck to people who knew him; Bismarck to those who only know of him through history; the man with the iron mask; the longest-lived of men. These are progressively further removed from acquaintance with particulars; the first comes as near to acquaintance as is possible in regard to another person; in the second, we shall still be said to know \'who Bismarck was\'; in the third, we do not know who was the man with the iron mask, though we can know many propositions about him which are not logically deducible from the fact that he wore an iron mask; in the fourth, finally, we know nothing beyond what is logically deducible from the definition of the man. There is a similar hierarchy in the region of universals. Many universals, like many particulars, are only known to us by description. But here, as in the case of particulars, knowledge concerning what is known by description is ultimately reducible to knowledge concerning what is known by acquaintance.The fundamental principle in the analysis of propositions containing descriptions is this: Every proposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of constituents with which we are acquainted.","\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u044f \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \\"\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\\" \u0432 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043e \u043b\u044e\u0434\u044f\u0445, \u044f, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u044d\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \\"\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439\\". \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043c, \u044f \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044e: \\"A, B, C...

Por muy limitada que est\xe9 nuestra libertad en la esfera causal, no es necesario que admitamos limitaci\xf3n alguna para la misma en la esfera de los valores: lo que juzgamos bueno por s\xed mismo, podemos seguir juzg\xe1ndolo tal sin consideraci\xf3n a ninguna otra cosa que no sean nuestros propios sentimientos. La filosof\xeda no puede determinar por s\xed los fines de la vida, pero puede liberarnos de la tiran\xeda del prejuicio y de las aberraciones derivadas de estrechas miras. El amor, la belleza, el conocimiento y el goce de la vida: he aqu\xed las cosas que conservan inmarcesible lustre, por lejanos que sean nuestros horizontes. Y si la filosof\xeda puede ayudarnos a sentir el valor de estas cosas, habr\xe1 representado el papel que le corresponde en la obra colectiva de la Humanidad cuyo objeto es llevar la luz a un mundo de tinieblas.","El mundo que tenemos que buscar es un mundo en el cual el esp\xedritu creador est\xe9 vivo, en el cual la vida sea una aventura llena de alegr\xeda y de esperanza, basada m\xe1s en el impulso de construir que en el deseo de guardar lo que poseemos y de apoderarnos de lo que poseen los dem\xe1s. Tiene que ser un mundo en el cual el cari\xf1o pueda obrar literalmente, el amor est\xe9 purgado del instinto de la dominaci\xf3n, la crueldad y la envidia hayan sido disipadas por la alegr\xeda y el desarrollo ilimitado de todos los instintos constructivos de la vida y la llenen de delicias espirituales. Un mundo as\xed es posible; espera solamente a que los hombres quieran crearlo.","The chief importance of knowledge by description is that it enables us to pass beyond the limits of our private experience. In spite of the fact that we can only know truths which are wholly composed of terms which we have experienced in acquaintance, we can yet have knowledge by description of things which we have never experienced. In view of the very narrow range of our immediate experience, this result is vital, and until it is understood, much of our knowledge must remain mysterious and therefore doubtful.","The important and effective mental attitudes to the world may be broadly divided into the religious and the scientific. The scientific attitude is tentative and piecemeal, believing what it finds evidence for, and no more. Since Galileo, the scientific attitude has proved itself increasingly capable of ascertaining important facts and laws, which are acknowledged by all competent people regardless of temperament or self-interest or political pressure. Almost all the progress in the world from the earliest times is attributable to science and the scientific temper; almost all the major ills are attributable to religion.","The classical tradition in philosophy is the last surviving child of two very diverse parents: the Greek belief in reason, and the medi\xe6val belief in the tidiness of the universe. To the schoolmen, who lived amid wars, massacres, and pestilences, nothing appeared so delightful as safety and order. In their idealising dreams, it was safety and order that they sought: the universe of Thomas Aquinas or Dante is as small and neat as a Dutch interior. To us, to whom safety has become monotony, to whom the primeval savageries of nature are so remote as to become a mere pleasing condiment to our ordered routine, the world of dreams is very different from what it was amid the wars of Guelf and Ghibelline. Hence William James\'s protest against what he calls the \u201cblock universe of the classical tradition; hence Nietzsche\'s worship of force; hence the verbal bloodthirstiness of many quiet literary men. The barbaric substratum of human nature, unsatisfied in action, finds an outlet in imagination. In philosophy, as elsewhere, this tendency is visible; and it is this, rather than formal argument, that has thrust aside the classical tradition for a philosophy which fancies itself more virile and more vital. B.\u201d","Todo lo que constituye una persona es una serie de experiencias unidas por la memoria y por ciertas similitudes que llamamos h\xe1bito.","the fact that the actual inequalities of power exceed what is made necessary by technical causes, can only be explained in terms of individual psychology and physiology.","El obispo pasa a arg\xfcir que \'el universo ha sido hecho y est\xe1 gobernado por un prop\xf3sito inteligente\' y que ser\xeda una falta de inteligencia el haber hecho al hombre para que pereciera. Hay muchas respuestas a este argumento. En primer lugar, se ha hallado, en la investigaci\xf3n cient\xedfica de la Naturaleza, que la intrusi\xf3n de valores est\xe9ticos o morales, ha sido siempre un obst\xe1culo para el descubrimiento. Sol\xeda pensarse que los cuerpos celestes ten\xedan que moverse en c\xedrculos, porque el c\xedrculo es la curva m\xe1s perfecta; que las especies ten\xedan que ser inmutables, porque Dios s\xf3lo creaba lo perfecto y, por lo tanto, no hab\xeda necesidad de mejora; que no deb\xedan combatirse las epidemias como no fuera mediante el arrepentimiento, porque eran un castigo del pecado, etc. La naturaleza es indiferente a nuestros valores, y s\xf3lo puede ser entendida ignorando nuestros conceptos del bien y del mal. El universo puede tener un fin, pero nada de lo que nosotros sabemos sugiere que, de ser as\xed, ese prop\xf3sito tiene alguna semejanza con los nuestros.","Similarly, it takes about eight minutes for the sun\'s light to reach us; thus, when we see the sun we are seeing the sun of eight minutes ago. So far as our sense-data afford evidence as to the physical sun they afford evidence as to the physical sun of eight minutes ago; if the physical sun had ceased to exist within the last eight minutes, that would make no difference to the sense-data which we call \'seeing the sun\'. This affords a fresh illustration of the necessity of distinguishing between sense-data and physical objects.","If the matter is one that can be settled by observation, make the observation yourself.","Ve yine bence, kaleme al\u0131nd\u0131\u011f\u0131 \u015fekliyle, tek bir virg\xfcl\xfcn\xfc dahi de\u011fi\u015ftirme gere\u011fi olmaks\u0131z\u0131n, \u0130nsan Haklar\u0131 Evrensel Bildirisi, ilkelerin do\u011frulu\u011fu ve hedeflerin berrakl\u0131\u011f\u0131 bak\u0131m\u0131ndan, yery\xfcz\xfcndeki b\xfct\xfcn siyasi parti programlar\u0131n\u0131n lay\u0131k\u0131yla yerine ge\xe7ebilir.","Thinking that you know when in fact you don\u2019t is a fatal mistake, to which we are all prone.","Bir ki\u015fi bir partiye oy verir, ama mutsuzlu\u011fu s\xfcrer; bunun \xfczerine de millenium\u2019u getirecek olan\u0131n \xf6teki parti oldu\u011fu sonucuna var\u0131r.

There was no purpose in the universe; there were only atoms governed by mechanical laws. He disbelieved in popular religion* and he argued against the nous of Anaxagoras. In ethics he considered cheerfulness the goal of life, and regarded moderation and culture as the best means to it. He disliked everything violent and passionate; he disapproved of sex, because, he said, it involved the overwhelming of consciousness by pleasure. He valued friendship, but thought ill of women, and did not desire children, because their education interferes with philosophy.

In the spectacle of Death, in the endurance of intolerable pain, and in the irrevocableness of a vanished past, there is a sacredness, an overpowering awe, a feeling of the vastness, the depth, the inexhaustible mystery of existence, in which, as by some strange marriage of pain, the sufferer is bound to the world by bonds of sorrow. In these moments of insight, we lose all eagerness of temporary desire, all struggling and striving for petty ends, all care for the little trivial things that, to a superficial view, make up the common life of day by day; we see, surrounding the narrow raft illumined by the flickering light of human comradeship, the dark ocean on whose rolling waves we toss for a brief hour; from the great night without, a chill blast breaks in upon our refuge; all the loneliness of humanity amid hostile forces is concentrated upon the individual soul, which must struggle alone, with what of courage it can command, against the whole weight of a universe that cares nothing for its hopes and fears. Victory, in this struggle with the powers of darkness, is the true baptism into the glorious company of heroes, the true initiation into the overmastering beauty of human existence. From that awful encounter of the soul with the outer world, enunciation, wisdom, and charity are born; and with their birth a new life begins.","The right age for marriage is thirty-seven in men, eighteen in women.

Even the shrewdest men are apt to be wildly astray if they prophecy so much as 10 years ahead. Some people will consider this doctrine immoral, but after all it is the Gospel which says \u201ctake no thought for the morrow.\u201d","Zwyczaj lekkomy\u015blnego przylepiania etykietek s\u0142u\u017cy wygodzie ludzi, kt\xf3rzy chc\u0105 si\u0119 wyda\u0107 bystrzy bez konieczno\u015bci my\u015blenia, niewielki jednak ma zwi\u0105zek z rzeczywisto\u015bci\u0105.","For the first time in history, it is now possible, owing to the industrial revolution and its byproducts, to create a world where everybody shall have a reasonable chance of happiness. Physical evil can, if we choose, be reduced to very small proportions. It would be possible, by organization and science, to feed and house the whole population of the world, not luxuriously, but sufficiently to prevent great suffering. It would be possible to combat disease, and to make chronic ill-health very rare. \u2026 All this is of such immeasurable value to human life that we dare not oppress the sort of education which will tend to bring it about. in such an education, applied science will have to be the chief ingredient. Without physics and physiology and psychology, we cannot build the new world.","I have no longer the feeling that intellect is superior to sense, and that only Plato\'s world of ideas gives access to the \'real\' world. I used to think of sense, and of thought which is built on sense, as a prison from which we can be freed by thought which is emancipated from sense. I now have no such feelings. I think of sense, and of thoughts built on sense, as windows, not as prison bars. I think that we can, however imperfectly, mirror the world, like Leibniz\'s monads; and I think it is the duty of the philosopher to make himself as undistorting a mirror as he can. But it is also his duty to recognize such distortions as are inevitable from our very nature. Of these, the most fundamental is that we view the world from the point of view of the here and now, not with that large impartiality which theists attribute to the Deity. To achieve such impartiality is impossible for us, but we can travel a certain distance towards it. To show the road to this end is the supreme duty of the philosopher.","The general principles of science, such as the belief in the reign of law, and the belief that every event must have a cause, are as completely dependent upon the inductive principle as are the beliefs of daily life All such general principles are believed because mankind have found innumerable instances of their truth and no instances of their falsehood. But this affords no evidence for their truth in the future, unless the inductive principle is assumed.","Ich h\xe4tte gern eine Welt, in der das Ziel der Erziehung geistige Freiheit w\xe4re und nicht darin best\xfcnde, den Geist der Jugend in eine R\xfcstung zu zw\xe4ngen, die ihn das ganze Leben lang vor den Pfeilen objektiver Beweise sch\xfctzen soll.

Only the military issue of the Civil War proved that his interpretation of the Constitution was the wrong one. The same thing happened in the American Civil War. Had States the right to secede? No one knew, and only the victory of the North decided the legal question. The belief\u2014 which one finds in Locke and in most writers of his time\u2014that any honest man can know what is just and lawful, is one that does not allow for the strength of party bias on both sides, or for the difficulty of establishing a tribunal, whether outwardly or in men\u2019s consciences, that shall be capable of pronouncing authoritatively on vexed questions. In practice, such questions, if sufficiently important, are decided simply by power, not by justice and law. To some degree, though in veiled language, Locke recognizes this fact. In a dispute between legislative and executive, he says, there is, in certain cases, no judge under Heaven. Since Heaven does not make explicit pronouncements, this means, in effect, that a decision can only be reached by fighting, since it is assumed that Heaven will give the victory to the better cause. Some such view is essential to any doctrine that divides governmental power. Where such a doctrine is embodied in the Constitution, the only way to avoid occasional civil war is to practise compromise and common sense. But compromise and common sense are habits of mind, and cannot be embodied in a written constitution.\u201d","the broad rule is that it is easier now than in former days to exert power at a distance from the centre. The effect of this is to increase the intensity of competition between States, and to make victory more absolute, since the resulting increase of size need not impair efficiency. A World State is now a technical possibility, and might be established by a victor in some really serious world-war, or, more probably, by the most powerful of the neutrals.","meeting dangers is no part of the essential purpose of economic organisations, or of governmental organisations concerned with internal affairs. But lifeboats and fire-brigades, like armies and navies, are constructed for the purpose of meeting dangers. In a certain less immediate sense, this is also true of religious bodies, which exist in part to allay the metaphysical fears that are buried deep in our nature.","Nie przejmuj si\u0119 autorytetami.

To take a simple instance: physics might, ideally, be able to predict that at such a time my eye would receive a stimulus of a certain sort; it might be able to trace the physical properties of the resulting events in the eye and the brain, one of which is, in fact, a visual percept; but it could not itself give us the knowledge that one of them is a visual percept. It is obvious that a man who can see knows things which a blind man cannot know; but a blind man can know the whole of physics. Thus the knowledge which other men have and he has not is not part of physics.","A tutto ci\xf2 vanno aggiunte, in quanto contribuiscono alla felicit\xe1 dell\'uomo di scienza, la bellezza delle pi\xf9 splendide conquiste, e la coscienza di un\'utilit\xe0 inestimabile per la razza umana.

Within five minutes I went through some such reflections as the following: the loneliness of the human soul is unendurable; nothing can penetrate it except the highest intensity of the sort of love that religious teachers have preached; whatever does not spring from this motive is harmful, or at best useless; it follows that war is wrong, that a public school education is abominable, that the use of force is to be deprecated, and that in human relations one should penetrate to the core of loneliness in each person and speak to that \u2026 At the end of those five minutes I had become a completely different person. For a time, a sort of mystic illumination possessed me","Men who boast of being what is called \u2018practical\u2019 are for the most part exclusively pre-occupied with means. But theirs\' is only one half of wisdom. When we take account of the other half, which is concerned with ends, the economic process and the whole of human life takes on an entirely new aspect. We ask no longer: what have the producers produced, and what has consumption enabled the consumers in their turn to produce? We ask instead: what has there been in the lives of consumers and producers to make them glad to be alive? What have they felt or known or done that could justify their creation? Have they experienced the glory of new knowledge? Have they known love and friendship? Have they rejoiced in sunshine and the spring and the smell of flowers? Have they felt the joy of life that simple communities express in dance and song?","something","[Pythagoras] is one of the most interesting and puzzling men in history.

When asked why, since no man can see them, they reply: \\"Oh, but you forget the good God.\\" Apparently they conceive of the Deity add a Peeping Tom, whose omnipotence enables Him to see through bathroom walls, but who is foiled by bathrobes.","That is why the individual man is the bearer of good and evil, and not, on the one hand, any separate part of a man, or on the other hand, any collection of men.

And of course, as we know, it is in its major part an opponent still of progress and improvement in all the ways that diminish suffering in the world, because it has chosen to label as morality a certain narrow set of rules of conduct which have nothing to do with human happiness; and when you say that this or that ought to be done because it would make for human happiness, they think that has nothing to do with the matter at all. \'What has human happiness to do with morals? The object of morals is not to make people happy.","These two sentences suffice to show, as I shall try to prove, that Bergson does not know what number is, and has himself no clear idea of it.","Modern technique has made it possible for leisure, within limits, to be not the prerogative of small privileged classes, but a right distributed throughout the community","The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery","I think that these is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached","La competencia, considerada como lo m\xe1s importante de la vida, es algo demasiado triste, demasiado duro, demasiado cuesti\xf3n de m\xfasculos tensos y voluntad firme, para servir como base de la vida durante m\xe1s de una o dos generaciones, como m\xe1ximo. Despu\xe9s de ese plazo tiene que provocar fatiga nerviosa, diversos fen\xf3menos de escape, una b\xfasqueda de placeres tan tensa y tan dif\xedcil como el trabajo (porque relajarse resulta ya imposible), y al final la desaparici\xf3n de la estirpe por esterilidad. No es solo el trabajo lo que ha quedado envenenado por la filosof\xeda de la competencia; igualmente envenenado ha quedado el ocio. El tipo de ocio tranquilo y restaurador de los nervios se considera aburrido. Tiene que haber una continua aceleraci\xf3n, cuyo desenlace natural ser\xe1n las drogas y el colapso. El remedio consiste en reconocer la importancia del disfrute sano y tranquilo en un ideal de vida equilibrado.","More erudite authors who advocate an irrationalist point of view, such as the pragmatist philosophers, are not to be caught out so easily. They maintain that there is no such thing as objective fact to which our opinions must conform if they are to be true. For them opinions are merely weapons in the struggle for existence, and those which help a man to survive are to be called \u201ctrue.","all our reasonings concerning causes and effects are derived from nothing but custom; and that belief is more properly an act of the sensitive, than of the cogitative part of our natures.","first, pure persuasion leading to the conversion of a minority; then force exerted to secure that the rest of the community shall be exposed to the right propaganda; and finally a genuine belief on the part of the great majority, which makes the use of force again unnecessary.","Prudence versus passion is a conflict that runs through history.","love of power, as a motive, is limited by timidity, which also limits the desire for self-direction. Since power enables us to realise more of our desires than would otherwise be possible, and since it secures deference from others, it is natural to desire power except in so far as timidity interferes. This sort of timidity is lessened by the habit of responsibility, and accordingly responsibilities tend to increase the desire for power. Experience of cruelty and unfriendliness may operate in either direction: with those who are easily frightened it produces the wish to escape observation, while bolder spirits are stimulated to seek positions in which they can inflict cruelties rather than suffer them.","In England, his views were so completely in harmony with those of most intelligent men that it is difficult to trace their influence except in theoretical philosophy; in France, on the other hand, where they led to an opposition to the existing regime in practice and to the prevailing Cartesianism in theory, they clearly had a considerable effect in shaping the course of events. This is an example of a general principle: a philosophy developed in a politically and economically advanced country, which is, in its birthplace, little more than a clarification and systemization of prevalent opinion, may become elsewhere a source of revolutionary ardour, and ultimately of actual revolution. It is mainly through theorists that the maxims regulating the policy of advanced countries become known to less advanced countries. In the advanced countries, practice inspires theory; in the others, theory inspires practice. This difference is one of the reasons why transplanted ideas are seldom so successful as they were in their native soil.","El autor an\xf3nimo de estos versos no buscaba una soluci\xf3n para el ate\xedsmo, ni la clave del universo; estaba simplemente pas\xe1ndoselo bien.","Sin duda el ideal es una cierta rigidez de acci\xf3n, m\xe1s una cierta flexibilidad de pensamiento, pero esto es dif\xedcil de lograr en la pr\xe1ctica excepto durante los breves per\xedodos de transici\xf3n. Y parece probable que, si las viejas ortodoxias decaen, surjan nuevos c\xf3digos r\xedgidos seg\xfan las necesidades del conflicto.","An individual human existence should be like a river - small at first, narrowly contained within it\'s banks, and rushing passionately past rocks and waterfalls. Gradually, the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged with the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being.","Gustavo Solivellas dice: \\"Nunca morir\xeda por mis creencias porque podr\xeda estar equivocado\\" (Bertrand Russell)","Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.","Si existiese en el mundo de hoy un n\xfamero tan grande de gente que deseara su propia felicidad m\xe1s de lo que desean la infelicidad del resto, tendr\xedamos el para\xedso en unos pocos a\xf1os","Cada um de n\xf3s n\xe3o permanece muito tempo neste mundo e, durante os poucos anos de exist\xeancia, tem de aprender tudo o que se conhece sobre este estranho planeta e o seu lugar no universo. Ignorar essas possibilidades de conhecimento, por imperfeito que possa ser, \xe9 como ir ao teatro e n\xe3o prestar aten\xe7\xe3o \xe0 pe\xe7a. O mundo est\xe1 cheio de coisas tr\xe1gicas, c\xf3micas, heroicas, bizarras e surpreendentes, e quem n\xe3o for capaz de se interessar pelo espet\xe1culo que ele oferece renuncia a um dos privil\xe9gios que a vida lhe pode dar.","The question whether we are also acquainted with our bare selves, as opposed to particular thoughts and feelings, is a very difficult one, upon which it would be rash to speak positively.","Unul dintre cele mai triste aspecte ale vremurilor noastre este c\u0103 cei care au certitudini sunt pro\u0219ti, iar cei cu imagina\u021bie \u0219i competen\u021b\u0103 sunt plini de dubii \u0219i indecizie.","My objections to Marx are of two sorts: one, that he was muddle-headed; and the other, that his thinking was almost entirely inspired by hatred.","Instinct, mind, and spirit are all essential to a full life; each has its own excellence and its own corruption. Each can attain a spurious excellence at the expense of the others; each has a tendency to encroach upon the others; but in the life which is to be sought all three will be developed in co\xf6rdination, and intimately blended in a single harmonious whole. Among uncivilized men instinct is supreme, and mind and spirit hardly exist. Among educated men at the present day mind is developed, as a rule, at the expense of both instinct and spirit, producing a curious inhumanity and lifelessness, a paucity of both personal and impersonal desires, which leads to cynicism and intellectual destructiveness. Among ascetics and\xa0most of those who would be called saints, the life of the spirit has been developed at the expense of instinct and mind, producing an outlook which is impossible to those who have a healthy animal life and to those who have a love of active thought. It is not in any of these one-sided developments that we can find wisdom or a philosophy which will bring new life to the civilized world.","We have acquaintance in sensation with the data of the outer senses, and in introspection with the data of what may be called the inner sense--thoughts, feelings, desires, etc.; we have acquaintance in memory with things which have been data either of the outer senses or of the inner sense. Further, it is probable, though not certain, that we have acquaintance with Self, as that which is aware of things or has desires towards things.","\u201eMarea problem\u0103 cu lumea este c\u0103 pro\u0219tii \u0219i fanaticii sunt \xeentotdeauna foarte siguri pe ei, \xeen timp ce oamenii mai \xeen\u021belep\u021bi, sunt plini de dubii.","In the outworks of our lives, we were almost strangers, but we shared a certain outlook on human life and human destiny, which, from the very first, made a bond of extreme strength . . . . At our very first meeting, we talked with continually increasing intimacy. We seemed to sink through layer after layer of what was superficial, till gradually both reached the central fire. It was an experience unlike any other that I have known. We looked into each other\'s eyes, half appalled and half intoxicated to find ourselves together in such a region. The emotion was as intense as passionate love, and at the same time all-embracing. I came away bewildered, and hardly able to find my way among ordinary affairs.","Now both Berkeley and Leibniz admit that there is a real table, but Berkeley says it is certain ideas in the mind of God, and Leibniz says it is a colony of souls.","\xc8 necessario, nei confronti di ogni forma di attivit\xe0 umana, porsi di tanto in tanto la domanda: qual \xe8 il suo scopo, qual \xe8 il suo ideale? In che modo contribuisce alla bellezza dell\'esistenza umana? In relazione alle attivit\xe0 che vi contribuiscono soltanto alla lontana, in quanto si occupano del meccanismo della vita, \xe8 bene ricordare che non soltanto il mero fatto di vivere va auspicato, ma l\'arte di vivere nella contemplazione delle cose grandi.
