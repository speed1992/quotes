People who make you laugh, who help you when you\u2019re in need. People who genuinely care. They are the ones worth keeping in your life. Everyone else is just passing through.","Take away a nation\'s heritage and they are more easily persuaded.","The education of all children, from the moment that they can get along without a mother\'s care, shall be in state institutions.","Communism begins where atheism begins.","If you can cut the people off from their history, then they can be easily persuaded.","We have no compassion and we ask no compassion from you. When our turn comes, we shall not make excuses for the terror.","The theory of Communism may be summed up in one sentence: Abolish all private property.","Catch a man a fish, and you can sell it to him. Teach a man to fish, and you ruin a wonderful business opportunity.","When the sufferers learn to think, then the thinkers will learn to suffer.","The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism.","All history is nothing but a continuous transformation of human nature.","The last capitalist we hang shall be the one who sold us the rope.","There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, , etc., that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.","The democratic concept of man is false, because it is Christian. The democratic concept holds that . . . each man is a sovereign being. This is the illusion, dream, and postulate of Christianity.","From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.","A heavy or progressive or graduated income tax is necessary for the proper development of Communism.","The first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of religion.","There must be something rotten in the very core of a social system which increases its wealth without diminishing its misery","We know that violent measures against religion are nonsense; but this is an opinion: as socialism grows, religion will disappear. Its disappearance must be done by social development, in which education must play a part.","...the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things... They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.","The unity is brought about by force .","The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people.","The rich will do anything for the poor but get off their backs.","Anyone who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without feminine upheaval. Social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex, the ugly ones included.","Social reforms are never carried out by the weakness of the strong; but always by the strength of the weak.","Owners of capital will stimulate working class to buy more and more of expensive goods, houses and technology, pushing them to take more and more expensive credits, until their debt becomes unbearable. The unpaid debt will lead to bankruptcy of banks which will have to be nationalized and State will have to take the road which will eventually lead to communism.","Do not be deluded by the abstract word Freedom. Whose freedom? Not the freedom of one individual in relation to another, but freedom of Capital to crush the worker.","Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.","Workers of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains.","The full man does not understand the wants of the hungry","Religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it cannot understand.","Religion is the opium of the masses.","Follow your own path, no matter what people say.","I wish to avenge myself against the One who rules above.","The existence of the state is inseparable from the existence of slavery.","The Jews of Poland are the smeariest of all races.","Democracy is the road to socialism.","A people without a heritage are easily persuaded.","There is no greater stupidity than for people...to marry and so surrender themselves to the small miseries of domestic and private life.","This young lady, who instantly overwhelmed me with her kindness, is the ugliest creature I have seen in my entire life, with repulsive Jewish facial features.","Change the economic base and you will change human beings.","To destroy Christianity, we must first destroy the British Empire.","Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.","Let us consider the actual, worldly Jew - not the Sabbath Jew, as Bauer does, but the everyday Jew. ... What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money. Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades all the gods of man - and turns them into commodities. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange. The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant, of the man of money in general.","Taxes are the source of life for the bureaucracy, the army and the court, in short, for the whole apparatus of the executive power. Strong government and heavy taxes are identical.","The unity of the bourgeoisie can be shaken only by the unity of the proletariat.","Is it a misfortune that magnificent California was seized from the lazy Mexicans who did not know what to do with it.","The only antidote to mental suffering is physical pain.","The less you eat, drink and read books; the less you go to the theatre, the dance hall, the public house; the less you think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save-the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor dust will devour-your capital. The less you are, the more you have; the less you express your own life, the greater is your alienated life-the greater is the store of your estranged being.","History repeats itself, the first as tragedy, then as farce.","For the bureaucrat, the world is a mere object to be manipulated by him.","The class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat.","The task is not just to understand the world but to change it.","Every provisional political set-up following a revolution requires a dictatorship, and an energetic dictatorship at that.","If anything is certain, it is that I myself am not a Marxist.","Money is the alienated essence of man\'s work and existence; this essence dominates him and he worships it.","May the devil take these peoples movements, especially when they are \'peaceful\'.","Landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed.","I do not like money, money is the reason we fight.","The state is the executive committee of the ruling class.","The social principles of Christianity preach cowardice, self-contempt, abasement, submission, humility, in a word all the qualities of the canaille","Private property has made us so stupid and partial that an object is only ours when we have it, when it exists for us as capital ... Thus all the physical and intellectual senses have been replaced by ... the sense of having.","Be careful to trust a person who does not like wine.","Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living.","Social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex.","Money plays the largest part in determining the course of history.","Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand.","There are no circumstances imaginable, not even victory, under which the proletariat should give up its possession of arms.","The history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles.","To be radical is to grasp things by the root.","The way people get their living determines their social outlook.","It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.","Reason has always existed, but not always in a reasonable form.","Revolutions are the locomotives of history.","In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.","Last words are for those fools who believe they have not yet said enough.","Man makes religion, religion does not make man","I am nothing but I must be everything.","In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property. - Manifesto of the Communist Party","Without the presence of class warfare, trade unions would be hard put to justfy their existence.","You will have to go through 15, 20, 50 years of civil wars and national struggles not only to bring about a change in society but also to change yourselves, and prepare yourselves for the exercise of political power.","Capital is dead labor, which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks.","We will hang the capitalists with the rope that they sell us.","The more of himself man attributes to God, the less he has left in himself.","When the train of history hits a curve, the intellectuals fall off.","In the eyes of dialectical philosophy, nothing is established for all times, nothing is absolute or sacred.","In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, shepherd or critic.","The working class is revolutionary or it is nothing.","The method of production of the material things of life generally determines the social, political and spiritual currents of life.","The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways: the point, however, is to change it.","The wealthy man is the man whois much, not the one who has much","With disdain I will throw my gauntlet full in the fact of the world and see the collapse of this pygmy giant. Then will I wander god-like and victorious through the ruins of the world. And giving my words an active force, I will feel equal to the Creator.","Misery motivates, not utopia.","If money is the bond binding me to human life, binding society to me, binding me and nature and man, is not money the bond of all bonds? Can it not dissolve and bind all ties? Is it not, therefore, the universal agent of separation?","Luxury is the opposite of the naturally necessary.","Only in community with others has each individual the means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; only in the community, therefore, is personal freedom possible.","Money degrades all the gods of man and converts them into commodities.","All I know is that I am not a Marxist.","Even an entire society, a nation, or all simultaneously existing societies taken together, are not owners of the earth. They are simply its possessors, its beneficiaries, and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations.","Machines were, it may be said, the weapon employed by the capitalists to quell the revolt of specialized labor.","A nation that enslaves another forges its own chains.","Communism... is the genuine resolution of the antagonism between man and nature and between man and man; it is the true resolution of the conflict between existence and essence, objectification and self-affirmation, freedom and necessity, individual and species. It is the riddle of history solved and knows itself as the solution.","Each pursues his private interest and only his private interest; and thereby serves the private interests of all, the general interest, without willing it or knowing it. The real point is not that each individual\'s pursuit of his private interest promotes the totality of private interests, the general interest. One could just as well deduce from this abstract phrase that each individual reciprocally blocks the assertion of the others\' interests, so that, instead of a general affirmation, this war of all against all produces a general negation.","Accumulate, accumulate! This is Moses and the Prophets!","Art is always and everywhere the secret confession, and at the same time the immortal movement of its time.","The alienation of man thus appeared as the fundamental evil of capitalist society.","So in Jewry we recognise a contemporary universal anti-social phenomenon, which has reached its present pitch through a process of, historical development in which the Jews have zealously co-operated. And this evil anti-social aspect of Jewry has grown to a stage at which: it must necessarily collapse.","They don\'t know it, but they are doing it.","In my free time I do differential and integral calculus.","We should not say that one man\'s hour is worth another man\'s hour, but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another man during an hour. Time is everything, man is nothing: he is at the most time\'s carcass.","The past lies like a nightmare upon the present.","Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.","...the French Revolution gave rise to ideas which led beyond the ideas of the entire old world order. The revolutionary movement which began in 1789... gave rise to the communist idea which Babeuf\'s friend Buonarroti re-introduced in France after the Revolution of 1830. This idea, consistently developed, is the idea of the new world order.","Philosophy stands in the same relation to the study of the actual world as masturbation to sexual love.","Private property has made us so stupid and one-sided that an object is only ours when we have it","Nothing can have value without being an object of utility.","The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.","The policy of Russia is changeless. Its methods, its tactics, its maneuvers may change, but the polar star of its policy, world domination, is a fixed star. About Russia","If this labourer were in possession of his own means of production, and was satisfied to live as a labourer, he need not work beyond beyond the time necessary for the reproduction of his means of subsistence, say 8 hours a day.","Crack-brained meddling by the authorities [can] aggravate an existing crisis.","Science and democracy are the right and left hands of what I\'ll refer to as the move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom.","A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of communism.","Men make their own history","Although gold and silver are not by nature money, money is by nature gold and silver.","You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.","Christ represents originally: 1) men before God; 2) God for men; 3) men to man. Similarly, money represents originally, in accordance with the idea of money: 1) private property for private property; 2) society for private property; 3) private property for society. But Christ is alienated God and alienated man. God has value only insofar as he represents Christ, and man has value only insofar as he represents Christ. It is the same with money.","Labour is ... not the only source of material wealth, i.e, of the use-values it produces. As William Petty says, Labour is the father of material wealth, the earth is its mother.","Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge.","Labor in the white skin can never free itself as long as labor in the black skin is branded.","Hitherto, every form of society has been based ... on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes.","Force is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one.","...the very cannibalism of the counterrevolution will convince the nations that there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.","The working men have no country. We cannot take away from them what they have not got","What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.","Men\'s ideas are the most direct emanations of their material state.","The imaginary flowers of religion adorn man\'s chains. Man must throw off the flowers, and also the chains.","The Communists have no need to introduce free love; it has existed almost from time immemorial.","The criticism of Religion is the beginning of all criticism","The whole proletariat must be armed at once with muskets, rifles, cannon and ammunition, and the revival of the old-style citizens militia, directed against the workers, must be opposed.","The more powerful the work, the more powerless the worker.","Money is therefore not only the object but also the fountainhead of greed.","Music is the mirror of reality.","Society is undergoing a silent revolution, which must be submitted to, and which takes no more notice of the human existences it breaks down than an earthquake regards the houses it subverts. The classes and the races, too weak to master the new conditions of life, must give way.","The more a ruling class is able to assimilate the most prominent men of a ruled class, the more solid and dangerous its rule.","It is in this sense that Franklin says, \\"war is robbery, commerce is generally cheating.","By means of the banking system the distribution of capital as a special business, a social function, is taken out of the hands of the private capitalists and usurers. But at the same time, banking and credit become the most effective means of driving captialist production beyond its own limits and one of the most effective vehicles of crises and swindle.","Scientific truth is always paradox, if judged by everyday experience, which catches only the delusive appearance of things.","Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.","Is a fixed income not a good thing? Does not everyone love to count on a sure thing? Especially every petty-bourgeois, narrow-minded Frenchman? the \'ever needy\' man?","Capitalist agricultural production prevents the return to the soil of its elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing; it therefore violates the conditions necessary to lasting fertility of the soil. By this action it destroys at the same time the health of the town labourer and the intellectual life of the rural labourer.","Hegel remarks somewhere that all great, world-historical facts and personages occur, as it were, twice. He has forgotten to add: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.","Necessity is blind until it becomes conscious. Freedom is the consciousness of necessity.","Religious distress is at the same time the expression of the real distress and also the protest against real distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of the spiritless condition. It is the opium of the people.","Nothing is more tedious than the dreaming platitude.","The worker puts his life into the object; but now it no longer belongs to him, it belongs to the object.","The entire so-called history of the world is nothing but the creation of man through human labor.","Communism deprives no man of the ability to appropriate the fruits of his labour. The only thing it deprives him of is the ability to enslave others by means of such appropriations.","The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force.","There is only one effective antidote for mental suffering and that is physical pain.","Men make their own history but not in circumstances of their own choosing.","Language is as old as consciousness, language is practical, real consciousness that exists for other men as well, and only therefore does it also exist for me; language, like consciousness, only arises from the need, the necessity, of intercourse with other men.","The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production, which has sprung up and flourished along with, and under it. Centralisation of the means of production and socialisation of labour at last reach a point where they become incompatible with there capitalist integument. This integument is burst asunder. The knell of capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators are expropriated.","If the labourer consumes his disposable time for himself, he robs the capitalist.","It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of Philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, it has set up that single, unconscionable freedom -- free trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.","The social revolution...cannot draw its poetry from the past, but only from the future. It cannot begin with itself before it has stripped itself of all superstitions concerning the past.","The most violent, mean and malignant passions of the human breast, the Furies of private interest.","Russia is a name usurped by the Muscovites. They are not Slavs; they do not belong to the Indo-Germanic race at all, they are des intrus [intruders], who must be chased back across the Dnieper, etc.","It is not history which uses men as a means of achieving - as if it were an individual person - its own ends. History is nothing but the activity of men in pursuit of their ends.","The national debt has given rise to joint stock companies, to dealings in negotiable effects of all kinds, and to agiotage , in a word to stock-exchange gambling and the modern bankocracy .","The consciousness of the past weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living.","History does nothing; it does not possess immense riches, it does not fight battles. It is men, real, living, who do all this.","What I did that was new was to prove that the existence of classes is only bound up with particular, historical phases in the development of production; that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat; and that dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society.","One capitalist always kills many.","One of the most difficult tasks confronting philosophers is to descend from the world of thought to the actual world.","Under private property, each tries to establish over the other an alien power, so as thereby to find satisfaction of his own selfish need. The increase in the quantity of objects is therefore accompanied by an extension of the realm of the alien powers to which man is subjected, and every new product represents a new potentiality of mutual swindling and mutual plundering.","Wherever the want of clothing forced them to it, the human race made clothes for thousands of years, without a single man becoming a tailor.","The most interesting acquaintanceship I have struck up here is that of Colonel Lapinski. He is without doubt the cleverest Pole - besides being an homme d\'action [man of action] - that I have ever met. His sympathies are all on the German side, though in manners and speech he is also a Frenchman. He cares nothing for the struggle of nationalities and only knows the racial struggle. He hates all Orientals, among whom he numbers Russians Turks, Greeks, Armenians, etc., with equal impartiality.... His aim now is to raise a German legion in London.","What the working man sells is not directly his Labor, but his Laboring Power, the temporary disposal of which he makes over to the capitalist. This is so much the case that I do not know whether by the English Law, but certainly by some Continental Laws, the maximum time is fixed for which a man is allowed to sell his laboring power. If allowed to do so for any indefinite period whatever, slavery would be immediately restored. Such a sale, if it comprised his lifetime, for example, would make him at once the lifelong slave of his employer.","And as for the Jews, who since the emancipation of their sect have everywhere put themselves, at least in the person of their eminent representatives, at the head of the counter-revolution -- what awaits them?","Ideas do not exist separately from language.","In capitalist society spare time is acquired for one class by converting the whole life-time of the masses into labour-time.","Money does not arise by convention, any more than the state does. It arises out of exchange, and arises naturally out of exchange; it is a product of the same.","Darwin\'s book is very important and serves me as a basis in natural science for the class struggle in history. One has to put up with the crude English method of development, of course. Despite all deficiencies not only is the death-blow dealt here for the first time to \'teleology\' in the natural sciences, but their rational meaning is empirically explained.","In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class, developed - a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These labourers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.","The human being is in the most literal sense a political animal, not merely a gregarious animal, but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society.","Wages are determined by the bitter struggle between capitalist and worker.","It\'s possible that I shall make an ass of myself. But in that case one can always get out of it with a little dialectic. I have, of course, so worded my proposition as to be right either way.","The capitalist mode of production and accumulation, and therefore capitalist private property, have for their fundamental condition the annihilation of self-earned private property: in other words, the expropriation of the labourer.","The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.","Since only what is material is perceptible, knowable, nothing is known of the existence of God.","...it is all the more clear what we have to accomplish at present: I am referring to ruthless criticism of all that exists, ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be.","Philosophy studies the world, but the point is to change it.","The product of mental labor - science - always stands far below its value, because the labor-time necessary to reproduce it has no relation at all to the labor-time required for its original production.","Exchange value forms the substance of money, and exchange value is wealth.","Each piece of money is a mere coin, or means of circulation, only so long as it actually circulates.","Just as the savage must wrestle with nature to satisfy his wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilised man, and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production.","As the variable capital always stays in the hands of the capitalist in some form or other, it cannot be claimed in any way that it converts itself into revenue for anyone .","It appears then, that capitalist production comprises conditions independent of good or bad will, conditions which permit the working-class to enjoy that relative prosperity only momentarily, and at that always only as the harbinger of a coming crisis.","The fact that labour is external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his intrinsic nature; that in his work, therefore he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself.","I am a machine, condemned to devour them and then, throw them, in a changed form, on the dunghill of history.","The more the division of labor and the application of machinery extend, the more does competition extend among the workers, the more do their wages shrink together.","Experience praises the most happy the one who made the most people happy.","We know only a single science, the science of history. History can be contemplated from two sides, it can be divided into the history of nature and the history of mankind. However, the two sides are not to be divided off; as long as men exist the history of nature and the history of men are mutually conditioned.","Although usury is itself a form of credit in its bourgeoisified form, the form adapted to capital , in its pre-bourgeois form it is rather the expression of the lack of credit .","The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They open declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!","Beauty is the main positive form of the aesthetic assimilation of reality, in which aesthetic ideal finds it direct expression.","In every revolution there intrude, at the side of its true agents, men of a different stamp; some of them survivors of and devotees to past revolutions, without insight into the present movement, but preserving popular influence by their known honesty and courage, or by the sheer force of tradition; others mere brawlers, who, by dint of repeating year after year the same set of stereotyped declamations against the government of the day, have sneaked into the reputation of revolutionists of the first water They are an unavoidable evil: with time they are shaken off.","An object of art creates a public capable of finding pleasure in its beauty. Production, therefore, not only produces an object for the subject, but also a subject for the object.","The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.","From the outset, the Christian was the theorizing Jew, the Jew is therefore the practical Christian, and the practical Christian has become a Jew again.","The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley of ties that bound man to his \\"natural superiors,\\" and left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous \\"cash payment.","Junk food, empty calories and carbs are the Big Data of the masses","In all of human history no country or no people have suffered such terrible slavery, conquest and foreign oppression and no country and no people have struggled so strenuously for their emancipation than Sicily and the Sicilians.","[Napoleon] swept away everywhere the establishments of feudality. ... [He was] Caesar himself.","The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas.","An increase in the productivity of labour means nothing more than that the same capital creates the same value with less labour, or that less labour creates the same product with more capital.","The bureaucracy is a circle from which one cannot escape. Its hierarchy is a hierarchy of knowledge. The top entrusts the understanding of detail to the lower levels, whilst the lower levels credit the top with understanding of the general, and so all are mutually deceived.","Since the working-class lives from hand to mouth,it buys as long as it has the means to buy.","Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the laborer, unless under compulsion from society.","Parliamentary cretinism: that peculiar malady which since 1848 has raged all over the Continent, which holds those infected by it fast in an imaginary world and robs them of all sense, all memory, all understanding of the rude external world.","All that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase capital , and allowed to live only so far as the interest to the ruling class requires it.","Work is external to the worker. . . . It is not part of his nature; consequently he does not fulfill himself in his work but denies himself. . . . The worker therefore feels himself at home only during his leisure time, whereas at work he feels homeless.","Those dogs of democrats and liberal riff-raff will see that we\'re the only chaps who haven\'t been stultified by the ghastly period of peace.","If one wants to be an ox one can easily turn one\'s back on hum suffering and look after one\'s own skin.","The will of the capitalist is certainly to take as much as possible. What we have to do is not to talk about his will, but to enquire about his power, the limits of that power, and the character of those limits.","But the more these conscious illusions of the ruling class are shown to be false and the less they satisfy common sense, the more dogmatically they are asserted and the more deceitful, moralizing and spiritual becomes the language of established society.","The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future.","Labor produces marvels for the rich but it produces deprivation for the worker. It produces palaces, but hovels for the worker. It produces beauty, but deformity for the worker. It replaces labor by machines, but it throws one section of the workers back to barbaric labor, and it turns the remainder into machines.","No production without a need. But consumption reproduces the need.","In proportion therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases.","There is one great fact, characteristic of this our nineteenth century, a fact which no party dares deny. On the one hand, there have started into life industrial and scientific forces which no epoch of former human history had ever suspected. On the other hand, there exist symptoms of decay, far surpassing the horrors recorded of the latter times of the Roman empire. In our days everything seems pregnant with its contrary.","In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.","Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution.","All freed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.","Greek philosophy seems to have met with something with which a good tragedy is not supposed to meet, namely, a dull ending.","The true law of economics is chance, and we learned people arbitrarily seize on a few moments and establish them as laws.","Without doubt, machinery has greatly increased the number of well-to-do idlers.","Nothing has changed in Russias policy. Her methods, her tactics, her maneuvers may change, but the pole starworld dominationis immutable.","Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth - the soil and the labourer.","Consumption is also immediately production, just as in nature the consumption of the elements and chemical substances is the production of the plant.","All I know is I\'m not a Marxist.","In a word, the free trade system hastens the social revolution. It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor of free trade.","Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries, unite!","Advances in science help to delegitimize the rule of kings and the power of the Church.","In proportion as capital accumulates, the lot of the laborer, be his payment high or low, must grow worse.","In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.","No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far, at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.","The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society.","The weapon of criticism can never replace the criticism of weapons.","In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy was obliged to lose sight, apparently, of its own interests, and to formulate its indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone. Thus, the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new masters and whispering in his ears sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe.","If we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually at work, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people.","Value, therefore, does not stalk about with a label describing what it is.","Merely quantitative differences,\\nbeyond a certain point,\\npass into qualitative changes.","...the first step in the revolution by the working class, is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class, to win the battle for democracy.","All social life is essentially practical. All mysterious which lead theory to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of the practice.","It would perhaps be as well if things were to remain quiet for a few years yet, so that all this 1848 democracy has time to rot away.","The capitalist knows that all commodities, however scurvy they may look, or however badly they may smell, are in faith and in truth money, inwardly circumcised Jews, and what is more, a wonderful means whereby out of money to make more money.","All science would be superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of things directly coincided.","In the United States of North America, every independent movement of the workers was paralysed so long as slavery disfigured a part of the Republic. Labour cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black it is branded.","The circulation of capital realizes value , while living labour creates value .","The directing motive, the end and aim of capitalist production, is to extract the greatest possible amount of surplus value, and consequently to exploit labor-power to the greatest possible extent.","The development of civilization and industry in general has always shown itself so active in the destruction of forests that everything that has been done for their conservation and production is completely insignificant in comparison.","The religious world is but a reflex of the real world.","The writer must earn money in order to be able to live and to write, but he must by no means live and write for the purpose of making money.","In the various stages of development which the struggle of working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.","We cannot tell by looking at the diamond that it is a commodity. When it serves as a use-value, asthetic or mechanical, on the breast of a harlot, or in the hand of a glasscutter, it is a diamond and not a commodity.","The English Established Church... will more readily pardon an attack on 38 of its 39 articles than on 1/39 of its income.","The better shaped his product, the more misshapen the worker.","Titles of property, for instance railway shares, may change hands every day, and their owner may make a profit by their sale even in foreign countries, so that titles to property are exportable, although the railway itself is not.","Capitalist production does not exist at all without foreign commerce.","The writer may very well serve a movement of history as its mouthpiece, but he cannot of course create it.","The essence of the free press is the reliable, reasonable and moral nature of freedom.","Under the ideal measure of values there lurks the hard cash.","In a higher phase of communist society... only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be fully left behind and society inscribe on its banners: from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.","As a beast of toil an ox is fixed capital. If he is eaten, he no longer functions as an instrument of labour, nor as fixed capital either.","The object of art like every other product creates a public which is sensitive to art and enjoys beauty.","In the domain of Political Economy, free scientific inquiry meets not merely the same enemies as in all other domains. The peculiar nature of the material it deals with, summons as foes into the field of battle the most violent, mean and malignant passions of the human breast, the Furies of private interest.","The French need a thrashing. If the Prussians win, the centralization of state power will be useful for the centralization of the German working class. German predominance would also transfer the center of gravity of the workers\' movement in Western Europe from France to Germany, and one has only to compare the movement in the two countries from 1866 until now to see that the German working class is superior to the French both theoretically and organizationally.","English law in 1572 decreed that beggars above 14 years of age are to be severely flogged and branded on the left ear unless some one will take them into service for two years; in case of a repetition of the offense, if they are over 18, they are to be executed, unless some one will take them into service for two years; but for the third offence they are to be executed without mercy as felons.","There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits. (Preface to the French edition).","As for slavery, there is no need for me to speak of its bad aspects. The only thing requiring explanation is the good side of slavery. I do not mean indirect slavery, the slavery of proletariat; I mean direct slavery, the slavery of the Blacks in Surinam, in Brazil, in the southern regions of North America. Direct slavery is as much the pivot upon which our present-day industrialism turns as are machinery, credit, etc. \u2026 Slavery is therefore an economic category of paramount importance.","The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature.","Be aware that the reward for labour, and quantity of labour, are quite disparate things.","Nature is man\'s inorganic body -- that is to say, nature insofar as it is not the human body. Man lives from nature -- i.e., nature is his body -- and he must maintain a continuing dialogue with it is he is not to die. To say that man\'s physical and mental life is linked to nature simply means that nature is linked to itself, for man is a part of nature.","When commercial capital occupies a position of unquestioned ascendancy, it everywhere constitutes a system of plunder.","If emancipation of the working classes requires their fraternal conncurrence, how are they to fulfill that great mission with a foreign policy in pursuit of criminal designs, playing upon national prejudices, and squandering in piratical wars the people\'s blood and treasure? It was not the wisdom of the ruling classes, but the heroic resistance to their criminal folly by the working classes of England, that saved the west of Europe from plunging headlong into an infamous crusade for the propagation of slavery on the other side of the Atlantic.","Price, taken by itself, is nothing but the monetary expression of value.","Hence money may be dirt, although dirt is not money.","Every emancipation is a restoration of the human world and of human relationships to a man himself.","Surplus-value and the rate of surplus-value are... the invisible essence to be investigated, whereas the rate of profit and hence the form of surplus-value as profit are visible surface phenomena","These numerous points at which money is withdrawn from circulation and accumulated in numerous individual hoards or potential money-capitals appears as so many obstacles to circulation, because they immobilise the money and deprive it of its capacity to circulate for a certain time.","Capital brings forth living offspring, or at the least, lays the golden eggs.","As the chosen people bore in their features the sign manual of Jehovah , so the division of labour brands the manufacturing workman as the property of capital .","Anyone wanting a new house picks one from among those built on speculation or still in process of construction. The builder no longer works for his customers but for the market.","I am nothing and should be everything.","...it happens that society is saved as often as the circle of its ruling class is narrowed, as often as a more exclusive interest asserts itself over the general. Every demand for the most simple bourgeois financial reform, for the most ordinary liberalism, for the most commonplace republicanism, for the flattest democracy is forthwith punished as an assault upon society and is branded as Socialism.","Colonial system, public debts, heavy taxes, protection, commercial wars, etc., these offshoots of the period of manufacture swell to gigantic proportions during the period of infancy of large-scale industry. The birth of the latter is celebrated by a vast, Hero-like slaughter of the innocents.","There are no bigger donkeys than these workers.... Look at our \'craftsmen\'; Sad that world history should be be made with such people.","There is something in human history like retribution; and it is a rule of historical retribution that its instrument be forged not by the offended, but by the offender himself. The first blow dealt to the French monarchy proceeded from the nobility, not from the peasants. The Indian revolt does not commence with the ryots, tortured, dishonoured and stripped naked by the British, but with the sepoys, clad, fed and petted, fatted and pampered by them.","By the aristocracy of finance must here be understood not merely the great loan promoters and speculators in public funds, in regard to whom it is immediately obvious that their interests coincide with the interests of the state power. All modern finance, the whole of the banking business, is interwoven in the closest fashion with public credit.","The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of other circumstances and changed upbrinding, forgets that it is men that change circumstances and that the educator himself needs educating.","All forms of the state have democracy for their truth, and for that reason are false to the extent that they are not democracy","When the labourer co-operates systematically with others, he strips off the fetters of his individuality, and develops the capabilities of his species.","Religion is the opiate of the people.","All social rules and all relations between individuals are eroded by a cash economy, avarice drags Pluto himself out of the bowels of the earth.","It might otherwise appear paradoxical that money can be replaced by worthless paper; but that the slightest alloying of its metallic content depreciates it.","The world will be for the common people, and the sounds of Happiness will reach even the deepest springs.","Labor, being itself a commodity, is measured as such by the labor time needed to produce the labor-commodity. And what is needed to produce this labor-commodity? Just enough labor time to produce the objects indispensable to the constant maintenance of labor, that is, to keep the worker alive and in a condition to propagate his race. The natural price of labor is no other than the wage minimum.","Religion is the balm of the people.","The bureaucracy takes itself to be the ultimate purpose of the state","Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.","Constant labor of one uniform kind destroys the intensity and flow of a man\'s animal spirits, which find recreation and delight in mere change of activity.","Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness, and for the success of the cause itself, the alteration of men on a mass scale is necessary, an alteration which can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew.","The traditions of the dead generations weigh like a nightmare upon the living.","Since labour is motion, time is its natural measure.","Medicine heals doubts as well as diseases.","The bourgeoisie of the whole world, which looks complacently upon the wholesale massacre after the battle, is convulsed by horror at the desecration of brick and mortar.","Bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not work.","Gold is now money with reference to all other commodities only because it was previously, with reference to them, a simple commodity.","Men can see nothing around them that is not their own image; everything speaks to them of themselves. Their very landscape is alive.","In the bureaucracy, the identity of state interest and particular private aim is established in such a way that the state interest becomes a particular private aim over against other private aims.","Usury lives in the pores of production, as it were, just as the gods of Epicurus lived in the space between the worlds.","A man cannot become a child again, or he becomes childish.","While the miser is merely a capitalist gone mad, the capitalist is a rational miser.","It is absolutely impossible to transcend the laws of nature. What can change in historically different circumstances is only the form in which these laws expose themselves.","The individual produces an object and, by consuming it, returns to himself, but returns as a productive and self reproducing individual. Consumption thus appears as a moment of production.","Darwin has interested us in the history of nature\'s technology.","As in private life one differentiates between what a man thinks and says of himself and what he really is and does, so in historical struggles one must still more distinguish the language and the imaginary aspirations of parties from their real organism and their real interests, their conception of themselves from their reality.","Mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve; since, looking at the matter more closely, we will always find that the task itself arises only when the material conditions necessary for its solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation.","Language comes into being, like consciousness, from the basic need, from the scantiest intercourse with other human.","The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.","Philosophy is to science as masturbation is to sex.","So far no chemist has ever discovered exchange-value either in a pearl or a diamond.","The redeeming feature of war is that it puts a nation to the test. As exposure to the atmosphere reduces all mummies to instant dissolution, so war passes supreme judgment upon social systems that have outlived their vitality.","Civil servants and priests, soldiers and ballet-dancers, schoolmasters and police constables, Greek museums and Gothic steeples, civil list and services list -- the common seed within which all these fabulous beings slumber in embryo is taxation.","He who before was the money owner, now strides in front as capitalist; the possessor of labor-power follows as his laborer. The one with an air of importance, smirking, intent on business; the other hesitant, like one who is bringing his own hide to market and has nothing to expect but a hiding.","A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.","Capital is money, capital is commodities. By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs.","England has to fulfill a double mission in India: one destructive, the other regenerating - the annihilation of old Asiatic society, and the laying the material foundations of Western society in Asia... When a great social revolution shall have mastered the results of the bourgeois epoch... and subjected them to the common control of the most advanced peoples, then only will human progress cease to resemble that hideous, pagan idol, who would not drink the nectar but from the skulls of the slain.","The state is based on this contradiction. It is based on the contradiction between public and private life, between universal and particular interests. For this reason, the state must confine itself to formal, negative activities.","Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeosis epoch from all earlier ones.","Perseus wore a magic cap that the monsters he hunted down might not see him.  We draw the magic cap down over eyes and ears as a make-believe that there are no monsters.","If production be capitalistic in form, so, too, will be reproduction.","Society is a sort of organism on the growth of which conscious efforts can exercise little effect.","There is a physical relation between physical things. But it is different with commodities.","An organised system of machines, to which motion is communicated by the transmitting mechanism from a central automation, is the most developed form of production by machinery.","A commodity appears at first sight an extremely obvious, trivial thing. But its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties.","Religion is only the illusory sun which revolves round man as long as he does not revolve round himself.","But there is a devil of a difference between barbarians who are fit by nature to be used for anything, and civilized people who apply them selves to everything.","The English have all the material requisites for the revolution. What they lack is the spirit of generalization and revolutionary ardour.","Religion is the opium of the people translated from the German Die Religion ... ist das Opium des Volkessometimes misquoted as opiate of the people.","Moments are the elements of profit","Hazrat Mahal, Begum of Oudh, during the national liberation uprising of 1857-59 in India headed the rebels.","Go on, get out - last words are for fools who haven\'t said enough. To his housekeeper, who urged him to tell her his last words so she could write them down for posterity.","To discover the various use of things is the work of history.","As, in religion, man is governed by the products of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is governed by the products of his own hand.","Money appears as measure (in Homer, e.g. oxen) earlier than as medium of exchange, because in barter each commodity is still its own medium of exchange. But it cannot be its own or its own standard of comparison.","Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.","Very well then; emancipation from usury and money, that is, from practical, real Judaism, would constitute the emancipation of our time.","In short, competition has to shoulder the responsibility of explaining all the meaningless ideas of the economists, whereas it should rather be the economists who explain competition.","All our inventions have endowed material forces with intellectual life, and degraded human life into a material force.","The bureaucracy is a circle from which no one can escape. Its hierarchy is a hierarchy of knowledge.","The rule of the bourgeois democrats [in pre-federal Germany], from the very first, will carry within it the seeds of its own destruction","I am stretching out this volume, since those German dogs estimate the value of books by their cubic contents.","Political economy regards the proletarian like a horse, he must receive enough to enable him to work. It does not consider him, during the time when he is not working, as a human being. It leaves this to criminal law, doctors, religion, statistical tables, politics, and the beadle.","Free education for all children in public schools... Combination of education with industrial production","The circulation of commodities is the original precondition of the circulation of money.","The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere. The bourgeoisie has, through its exploitation of the world market, given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of reactionaries, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood.","In every stockjobbing swindle every one knows that some time or other the crash must come, but every one hopes that it may fall on the head of his neighbor, after he himself has caught the shower of gold and placed it in safety.","Modern society, which, soon after its birth, pulled Plutus by the hair of his head from the bowels of the earth, greets gold as its Holy Grail, as the glittering incarnation of the very principle of its own life.","The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signalised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production.","It is a bad thing to perform menial duties even for the sake of freedom; to fight with pinpricks, instead of with clubs. I have become tired of hypocrisy, stupidity, gross arbitrariness, and of our bowing and scraping, dodging, and hair-splitting over words. Consequently, the government has given me back my freedom.","A spectre is haunting Europe-the spectre of Communism. All the Powers of old Europe have entered into holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies. Where is the Party in opposition that has not been decried as Communistic by its opponents in power? Where the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?","In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interest of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality.","The leading princes are the most servile tools of English despotism. . . . The native princes are the stronghold of the present abominable English system.","The economic concept of value does not occur in antiquity .","[T]he task of abolishing the essence of Jewry is in truth the task of abolishing Jewry in civil society, abolishing the inhumanity of today\'s practice of life, the summit of which is the money system.","Once the inner connection is grasped, all theoretical belief in the permanent necessity of existing conditions collapses before their collapse in practice -- Letter to Ludwig Kugelmann (July 11, 1868)","Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, posses however, this distinctive feature; it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other.","History calls those men the greatest who have ennobled themselves by working for the common good; experience acclaims as happiest the man who has made the greatest number of people happy.","[The career a young man should choose should be] one that is most consonant with our dignity, one that is based on ideas of whose truth we are wholly convinced, one that offers us largest scope in working for humanity and approaching that general goal towards which each profession offers only one of the means: the goal of perfection ... If he works only for himself he can become a famous scholar, a great sage, an excellent imaginative writer [ Dichter ], but never a perfected, a truly great man.","But capitalist production begets,with the inexorability of a law of Nature,its own negation. It is the negation of negation.","...the realm of freedom does not commence until the point is passed where labor under the compulsion of necessity and of external utility is required.","Modern bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange, and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.","A great deal of capital, which appears to-day in the United States without any certificate of birth, was yesterday, in England, the capitalised blood of children.","The values of commodities are directly as the times of labor employed in their production, and are inversely as the productive powers of the labor employed.","If I negate powdered wigs, I am still left with unpowdered wigs.","A commodity has a value because it is a crystallization of social labor. The greatness of its value, or its relative value, depends upon the greater or less amount of that social substance contained in it; that is to say, on the relative mass of labor necessary for its production.","Natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man, just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science: there will be one science.","The aggregate capital appears as the capital stock of all individual capitalists combined. This joint stock company has in common with many other stock companies that everyone knows what he puts in, but not what he will get out of it.","A circuit performed by a capital and meant to be a periodical process, not an individual act, is called its turnover. The duration of this turnover is determined by the sum of its time of production and its time of circulation.","The burgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all nations into civilization.","The labour-power is a commodity , not capital, in the hands of the labourer, and it constitutes for him a revenue so long as he can continuously repeat its sale; it functions as capital after its sale, in the hands of the capitalist, during the process of production itself.","I pre-suppose, of course, a reader who is willing to learn something new and therefore to think for himself.","The proletarians have nothing to loose but their chains. They have a world to win.","2 is a proletariat prime, but 4, 6 and 8 are also composite proletariats. Composites of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains!","As individuals express their life, so they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce and with how they produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.","History does nothing, possesses no enormous wealth, fights no battles. It is rather man, the real, living man, who does everything, possesses, fights. It is not History, as if she were a person apart, who uses men as a means to work out her purposes, but history itself is nothing but the activity of men pursuing their purposes.","The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe.","But, you will say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.... The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.","The animal is one with its life activity. It does not distinguish the activity from itself. It is its activity. But man makes hislife activity itself an object of his will and consciousness. He has a conscious life activity. It is not a determination with which he is completely identified.","On a level plain, simple mounds look like hills; and the insipid flatness of our present bourgeoisie is to be measured by the altitude of its great intellects.","I am greatly pleased with the public, authentic isolation in which we two, you and I, now find ourselves. It is wholly in accord with our attitude and our principles.","Every one knows that there are no real forests in England.The deer in the parks of the great are demurely domestic cattle, fat as London alderman.","Every beginning is difficult, holds in all sciences.","In reality, the labourer belongs to capital before he has sold himself to capital.","When people speak of ideas that revolutionize society, they do but express the fact that within the old society, the elements of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.","So long as the product is sold, everything is taking its regular course from the standpoint of the capitalist producer.","The Tories in England had long imagined that they were enthusiastic about the monarchy, the church and beauties of the old English Constitution, until the day of danger wrung from them the confession that they are enthusiastic only about rent.","The capitalist cannot store labour-power in warehouses after he has bought it, as he may do with the raw material.","A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality.","The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.[These words are also inscribed upon his grave]","The oppressed are allowed once every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class are to represent and repress them.","The foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion does not make man. Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man \u2013 state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world...Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.","Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living. And just as they seem to be occupied with revolutionizing themselves and things, creating something that did not exist before, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language.","The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guildmaster and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, that each time ended, either in the revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.","Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.Workingmen of all countries unite!","A specter is haunting Europe\u2014the specter of Communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter; Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police spies.Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Communistic by its opponents in power? Where the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?Two things result from this fact.I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.","The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \'natural superiors,\' and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, callous \'cash payment.\' It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom\u2014Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers.The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.","Go on, get out! Last words are for fools who haven\'t said enough!","In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life\'s prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly\u2014only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!","The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered forms, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation, distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away; all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind.","...[G]reat progress was evident in the last Congress of the American \'Labour Union\' in that among other things, it treated working women with complete equality. While in this respect the English, and still more the gallant French, are burdened with a spirit of narrow-mindedness. Anybody who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without the feminine ferment. Social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex (the ugly ones included).","If anything is certain, it is that I myself am not a Marxist.[In a letter about the peculiar \'Marxism\' which arose in France 1882]","For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.","There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits.","If money is the bond binding me to human life, binding society to me, connecting me with nature and man, is not money the bond of all bonds? Can it not dissolve and bind all ties? Is it not, therefore, also the universal agent of separation?","The less you eat, drink, buy books, go to the theatre or to balls, or to the pub, and the less you think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you will be able to save and the greater will become your treasure which neither moth nor rust will corrupt\u2014your capital. The less you are, the less you express your life, the more you have, the greater is your alienated life and the greater is the saving of your alienated being.","The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilization. The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians\' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.","Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary","You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so: that is just what we intend.","Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.","The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.","We have no compassion and we ask no compassion from you. When our turn comes, we shall not make excuses for the terror. [from Suppression of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung]","Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society: all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labor of others by means of such appropriation.It has been objected, that upon the abolition of private property all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not work.","Society does not consist of individuals, but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand.","Then the world will be for the common people, and the sounds of happiness will reach the deepest springs. Ah! Come! People of every land, how can you not be roused.","The increase in value of the world of things is directly proportional to the decrease in value of the human world.","And here it becomes evident that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law. It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state that it has to feed him instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie; in other words, its existence is no longer compatible with society.The essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of the bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage-labor. Wage-labor rests exclusively on competition between the laborers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the laborers, due to competition, by their revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of modern industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.","If you love without evoking love in return - if through the vital expression of yourself as a loving person you fail to become a loved person, then your love is impotent, it is a misfortune.","Your favourite virtue ...

Hence it has robbed the whole world... of its proper value. Money is the alienated essence of man\'s labour and life, and this alien essence dominates him as he worships it.","the theory of Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.","In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or \u2013 this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms \u2013 with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.","The bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women. He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production. For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce the community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial. Our bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other\'s wives. Bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.","within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost of the individual labourer; all means for the development of production transform themselves into means of domination over, and exploitation of, the producers; they mutilate the labourer into a fragment of a man, degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine, destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into a hated toil; they estrange from him the intellectual potentialities of the labour process in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power; they distort the conditions under which he works, subject him during the labour process to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness; they transform his life-time into working-time, and drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of capital. But all methods for the production of surplus-value are at the same time methods of accumulation; and every extension of accumulation becomes again a means for the development of those methods. It follows therefore that in proportion as capital accumulates, the lot of the labourer, be his payment high or low, must grow worse. The law, finally, that always equilibrates the relative surplus population, or industrial reserve army, to the extent and energy of accumulation, this law rivets the labourer to capital more firmly than the wedges of Vulcan did Prometheus to the rock. It establishes an accumulation of misery, corresponding with accumulation of capital. Accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole, i.e., on the side of the class that produces its own product in the form of capital.","When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms, and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.In place of the old bourgeois society with its classes and class antagonisms we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.","It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic Saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written.","Money is the alienated essence of man\'s labor and life; and this alien essence dominates him as he worships it.","Education is free. Freedoom of education shall be enjoyed under the condition fixed by law and under the supreme control of the state","The road to hell is paved with good intentions.","In reality, the laborer belongs to capital before he has sold himself to capital. His economic bondage is both brought about and concealed by the periodic sale of himself, by his change of masters, and by the oscillation in the market price of labor power. Capitalist production, therefore, under its aspect of a continuous connected process, of a process of reproduction, produces not only commodities, not only surplus value, but it also produces and reproduces the capitalist relation; on the one side the capitalist, on the other the wage-laborer.","To be radical is to go to the root of the matter. For man, however, the root is man himself.","Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another.","All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.","Christ represents originally: 1) men before God; 2) God for men; 3) men to man.Similarly, money represents originally, in accordance with the idea of money: 1) private property for private property; 2) society for private property; 3) private property for society.But Christ is alienated God and alienated man. God has value only insofar as he represents Christ, and man has value only insofar as he represents Christ. It is the same with money.","These labourers, who must sell themselves piece-meal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.","You must be aware that the reward for labour, and quantity of labour, are quite disparate things.","Social progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex.","The realm of freedom actually begins only where labour which is determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases; thus in the very nature of things it lies beyond the sphere of actual material production. Just as the savage must wrestle with Nature to satisfy his wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilised man, and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production. With his development this realm of physical necessity expands as a result of his wants; but, at the same time, the forces of production which satisfy these wants also increase. Freedom in this field can only consist in socialised man, the associated producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by the blind forces of Nature; and achieving this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favourable to, and worthy of, their human nature. But it nonetheless still remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working-day is its basic prerequisite.","As individuals express their life, so they are.","Merely quantitative differences, beyond a certain point, pass into qualitative changes.","Just as man is governed, in religion, by the products of his own brain, so, in capitalist production, he is governed by the products of his own hand.","Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people.","Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps","To say that \\"the worker has an interest in the rapid growth of capital\\", means only this: that the more speedily the worker augments the wealth of the capitalist, the larger will be the crumbs which fall to him, the greater will be the number of workers than can be called into existence, the more can the mass of slaves dependent upon capital be increased.","Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other \u2014 bourgeoisie and proletariat.","Man makes his own history, but he does not make it out of the whole cloth; he does not make it out of conditions chosen by himself, but out of such as he finds close at hand.","Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.","The demand to give up the illusions about its condition is the demand to give up a condition that needs illusions","If you love without evoking love in return\u2014that is, if your loving as loving does not produce reciprocal love; if through a living expression of yourself as a loving person you do not make yourself a loved person, then your love is impotent\u2014 a misfortune.","Once the inner connection is grasped, all theoretical belief in the permanent necessity of existing conditions collapses before their collapse in practice-- Letter to Ludwig Kugelmann (July 11, 1868)","y\xfcrekten sevdi\u011fim,sana gene yaz\u0131yorum \xe7\xfcnk\xfc yaln\u0131z\u0131m ve \xe7\xfcnk\xfc kafam\u0131n i\xe7inde seninle konu\u015furken senin bunu bilmiyor, ya da bana kar\u015f\u0131l\u0131k veremiyor olmana katlanam\u0131yorum.k\u0131sa s\xfcreli ayr\u0131l\u0131klar iyi oluyor, \xe7\xfcnk\xfc hep bir arada olununca her \u015fey hi\xe7 ay\u0131rt edilemeyecek kadar birbirine benzemeye ba\u015fl\u0131yor. yan yana durduklar\u0131nda kuleler bile c\xfccele\u015firken, alelade ve ufak tefek \u015feyler yak\u0131ndan bak\u0131nca kocamanla\u015f\u0131r. k\xfc\xe7\xfck tedirginlikler onlara yol a\xe7an nesneler g\xf6z \xf6n\xfcnden kald\u0131r\u0131ld\u0131\u011f\u0131nda yok olabilir. yan yanal\u0131k dolay\u0131s\u0131yla s\u0131radanla\u015fan tutkularsa mesafenin b\xfcy\xfcs\xfcyle yeniden b\xfcy\xfcy\xfcp do\u011fal boyutlar\u0131na d\xf6nerler. a\u015fk\u0131m da \xf6yle. zaman\u0131n a\u015fk\u0131m\u0131 t\u0131pk\u0131 g\xfcne\u015f ve ya\u011fmurun bitkileri b\xfcy\xfctt\xfc\u011f\xfc gibi b\xfcy\xfctm\xfc\u015f oldu\u011funu anlamam i\xe7in senin bir an, s\u0131rf r\xfcyada bile olsa, benden kopar\u0131lman yetiyor. senden ayr\u0131l\u0131r ayr\u0131lmaz sana olan a\u015fk\u0131m b\xfct\xfcn ger\xe7ekli\u011fiyle kendini g\xf6steriyor: o, ruhumun b\xfct\xfcn enerjisiyle y\xfcre\u011fimin b\xfct\xfcn ki\u015fili\u011fini bir araya getiren bir dev. b\xf6ylece yeniden insan oldu\u011fumu hissediyorum \xe7\xfcnk\xfc i\xe7im tutkuyla doluyor. ara\u015ft\u0131rma ve \xe7a\u011fda\u015f e\u011fitimin bizi kuca\u011f\u0131na att\u0131\u011f\u0131 belirsizlikler ve b\xfct\xfcn nesnel ve \xf6znel izlenimlerimizde kusur bulmaya iten ku\u015fkuculuk bizi k\xfc\xe7\xfck, zay\u0131f ve m\u0131zm\u0131z k\u0131l\u0131yor. ama a\u015fk -feurbachvari insana a\u015fk de\u011fil, metabolizmaya a\u015fk de\u011fil, proletaryaya a\u015fk de\u011fil- sevdi\u011fine a\u015fk, yani sana a\u015fk, insan\u0131 yeniden insanla\u015ft\u0131r\u0131yor... d\xfcnyada \xe7ok di\u015fi var, kimileri de \xe7ok g\xfczel. ama ben, her bir hatt\u0131, hatta her bir k\u0131r\u0131\u015f\u0131\u011f\u0131 bana hayat\u0131m\u0131n en b\xfcy\xfck ve en tatl\u0131 an\u0131lar\u0131n\u0131 hat\u0131rlatan bir y\xfcz\xfc bir daha nerede bulabilirim? senin tatl\u0131 \xe7ehrende sonu gelmez ac\u0131lar\u0131m\u0131, yeri doldurulmaz kay\u0131plar\u0131m\u0131 bile okuyabilir ve senin tatl\u0131 y\xfcz\xfcn\xfc \xf6pt\xfc\u011f\xfcmde ac\u0131y\u0131 \xf6perim. ho\u015f\xe7a kal can\u0131m. seni ve \xe7ocuklar\u0131 binlerce kere \xf6perim. senin, karl manchester, 21 haziran, 1865","The economic structure of capitalist society has grown out of the economic structure of feudal society.

But, on the other hand, these new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production, and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements.

We have seen that, to daily reproduce his labouring power, he must daily reproduce a value of three shillings, which he will do by working six hours daily. But this does not disable him from working ten or twelve or more hours a day. But by paying the daily or weekly value of the spinner\'s labouring power the capitalist has acquired the right of using that labouring power during the whole day or week. He will, therefore, make him work say, daily, twelve hours. Over and above the six hours required to replace his wages, or the value of his labouring power, he will, therefore, have to work six other hours, which I shall call hours of surplus labour, which surplus labour will realize itself in a surplus value and a surplus produce. If our spinner, for example, by his daily labour of six hours, added three shillings\' value to the cotton, a value forming an exact equivalent to his wages, he will, in twelce hours, add six shillings\' worth to the cotton, and produce a proportional surplus of yarn. As he has sold his labouring power to the capitalist, the whole value of produce created by him belongs to the capitalist, the owner pro tem. of his labouring power. By advancing three shillings, the capitalist will, therefore, realize a value of six shillings, because, advancing a value in which six hours of labour are crystallized. By repeating this same process daily, the capitalist will daily advance three shillings and daily pocket six shillings, one half of which will go to pay wages anew, and the other half of which will form surplus value, for which the capitalist pays no equivalent. It is this sort of exchange between capital and labour upon which capitalistic production, or the wages system, is founded, and which must constantly result in reproducing the working man as a working man, and the capitalist as a capitalist.","In fact, the proposition that man\u2019s species nature is estranged from him means that one man is estranged from the other, as each of them is from man\u2019s essential nature.","The tradition of past generations weighs like the Alps on the brains of the living.","Such a crises occurs only where the ever-lengthening chain of payments,and an artificial system of settling them, has been fullydeveloped.

Although private property itself again conceives all these direct realizations of possession only as means of life, and the life which they serve as means is the life of private property \u2013 labour and conversion into capital.In the place of all physical and mental senses there has therefore come the sheer estrangement of all these senses, the sense of having. The human being had to be reduced to this absolute poverty in order that he might yield his inner wealth to the outer world.The abolition of private property is therefore the complete emancipation of all human senses and qualities, but it is this emancipation precisely because these senses and attributes have become, subjectively and objectively, human. The eye has become a human eye, just as its object has become a social, human object \u2013 an object made by man for man. The senses have therefore become directly in their practice theoreticians. They relate themselves to the thing for the sake of the thing, but the thing itself is an objective human relation to itself and to man, and vice versa. Need or enjoyment have consequently lost its egotistical nature, and nature has lost its mere utility by use becoming human use.","Not in vain does it [the proletariat] go through the stern but steeling school of labour.

It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life.

The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He feels at home when he is not working, and when he is working he does not feel at home. His labor is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labor. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labor is shunned like the plague. External labor, labor in which man alienates himself, is a labor of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Lastly, the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else\u2019s, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, of the human brain and the human heart, operates on the individual independently of him \u2013 that is, operates as an alien, divine or diabolical activity \u2013 so is the worker\u2019s activity not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self.","All mysteries which lead theory to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice.","Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades all the gods of man \u2013 and turns them into commodities. Money is the universal self-established value of all things.

This is the time when the very things which till then had been communicated, but never exchanged; given, but never sold; acquired, but never bought \u2013 virtue, love, conviction, knowledge, conscience, etc. \u2013 when everything, in short, passed into commerce. It is the time of general corruption, of universal venality, or, to speak in terms of political economy, the time when everything, moral or physical, having become a marketable value, is brought to the market to be assessed at its truest value.","Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriation.","A spectre is haunting Europe\u2014the spectre of Communism.","Pengabstrakan kerja dalam bentuk uang mengandaikan dialektika di antara perkerjaan/kerja yang secara sosial dibutuhkan untuk membuat barang dagangan/komoditi/jasa, dengan proses produksi kapitalisme yang justru meniadakan kerja manusia itu sendiri.

Indeed, where the product, as the object of labor, pays for labor itself, there the wage is but a necessary consequence of labor\u2019s estrangement. Likewise, in the wage of labor, labor does not appear as an end in itself but as the servant of the wage...An enforced increase of wages (disregarding all other difficulties, including the fact that it would only be by force, too, that such an increase, being an anomaly, could be maintained) would therefore be nothing but better payment for the slave, and would not win either for the worker or for labor their human status and dignity.Indeed, even the equality of wages, as demanded by Proudhon, only transforms the relationship of the present-day worker to his labor into the relationship of all men to labor. Society would then be conceived as an abstract capitalist.Wages are a direct consequence of estranged labor, and estranged labor is the direct cause of private property. The downfall of the one must therefore involve the downfall of the other.","In its rational form [dialectic] is a scandal and abomination to bourgeoisdom and its doctrinaire professors, because it includes in its comprehension and affirmative recognition of the existing state of things, at the same time also, the recognition of the negation of that state, of its inevitable breaking up; because it regards every historically developed social form as in fluid movement, and therefore takes into account its transient nature not less than its momentary existence because it lets nothing impose upon it, and is in its essence critical and revolutionary.","Philosophy and the study of the real world have the same relation to one another as onanism and sexual love.","History is not like some individual person, which uses men to achieve its ends. History is nothing but the actions of men in pursuit of their ends.","The windmill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam mill, society with the industrial capitalist","The bourgeois period of history has to create the material basis of the new world \u2014 on the one hand universal intercourse founded upon the mutual dependency of mankind, and the means of that intercourse; on the other hand the development of the productive powers of man and the transformation of material production into a scientific domination of natural agencies. Bourgeois industry and commerce create these material conditions of a new world in the same way as geological revolutions have created the surface of the earth. When a great social revolution shall have mastered the results of the bourgeois epoch, the market of the world and the modern powers of production, and subjected them to the common control of the most advanced peoples, then only will human progress cease to resemble that hideous, pagan idol, who would not drink the nectar but from the skulls of the slain.","To the capitalist, every luxury of the worker seems to be reprehensible, and everything that goes beyond the most abstract need \u2013 be it in the realm of passive enjoyment, or a manifestation of activity \u2013 seems to him a luxury.","It would be very difficult, if not altogether impossible, to establish any principle upon which the justice or expedience of capital punishment could be founded in a society glorying in its civilization.","Thus, in imagination, individuals seem freer under the dominance of the bourgeoisie than before, because their conditions of life seem accidental; in reality, of course, they are less free, because they are to a greater extent governed by material forces.","When the economists say that present-day relations \u2013 the relations of bourgeois production \u2013 are natural, they imply that these are the relations in which wealth is created and productive forces developed in conformity with the laws of nature. These relations therefore are themselves natural laws independent of the influence of time. They are eternal laws which must always govern society. Thus, there has been history, but there is no longer any.","National differences and antagonisms between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world-market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilized countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.","Up till now it has been thought that the growth of the Christian myths during the Roman Empire was possible only because printing was not yet invented. Precisely the contrary. The daily press and the telegraph, which in a moment spreads inventions over the whole earth, fabricate more myths (and the bourgeois cattle believe and enlarge upon them) in one day than could have formerly been done in a century.","It is one of the greatest misapprehensions to speak of free, human, social labour, of albour without private property. \\"Labour\\" by its very nature is unfree, unhuman, unsocial activity, determined by private property and creating private property. Hence the abolition of private property will become a reality only when it is concieved as the abolition of \\"labour\\".","What is crucial in the true state is not the fact that every citizen has the chance to devote himself to the universal interest in the shape of a particular class, but the capacity of the universal class to be really universal, i.e. to be the class of every citizen.","The heart of a man is a wonderful thing, especially when it is carried in his wallet.","These contradictions, of course, lead to explosions, crises, in which momentary suspension of all labour and annihilation of a great part of the capital violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled [to go on] fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide. Yet, these regularly recurring catastrophes lead to their repetition on a higher scale, and finally to its violent overthrow. There are moments in the developed movement of capital which delay this movement other than by crises; such as e.g. the constant devaluation of a part of the existing capital: the transformation of a great part of capital into fixed capital which does not serve as agency of direct production; unproductive waste of a great portion of capital etc.","Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance in that class.

It is an offspring of that false and superficial radicalism that accepts premises and tries to evade conclusions. Upon the basis of the wages system the value of labouring power is settled like that of every other commodity; and as different kinds of labouring power have different values, or require different quantities of labour for their production, they must fetch different prices in the labour market. To clamour for equal or even equitable retribution on the basis of the wages system is the same as to clamour for freedom on the basis of the slavery system. What you think just or equitable is out of the question. The question is: What is necessary and unavoidable with a given system of production? After what has been said, it will be seen that the value of labouring power is determined by the value of the necessaries required to produce, develop, maintain, and perpetuate the labouring power.","\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u062a\u0637\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u060c \u064a\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0644 \u062a\u0637\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0644\u0647\u0627","...to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, [and] criticise after dinner...","\u0422\u043e\u0439 \u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0430, \u043d\u0435\u0438\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442, \u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0438\u043d \u0441\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043a\u0442. \u0422\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u0441\u044a\u043b \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430, \u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u044a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e \u0441 \u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435 - \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u043e \u044f \u0432 \u0430\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.","Nobody \u2014 not even \u201ca musician of the future \u2014 can live upon future products.\u201d","Everyone who knows anything of history also knows that great social revolutions are impossible without the feminine ferment.

These relations therefore are themselves natural laws independent of the influence of time. They are eternal laws which must always govern society. Thus, there has been history, but there is no longer any. There has been history, since there were institutions of feudalism, and in these institutions of feudalism we find quite different relations of production from those of bourgeois society, which the economists try to pass off as natural and, as such, eternal.","Everyone of our relationships with nature and man must be a definite expression of our real, individual life.","What exclusively determines the magnitude of the value of any article is therefore the amount of labour socially necessary, or the labour-time socially necessary for its production.","But capital not only lives upon labour.

As Hegel here puts self-consciousness in the place of man, the most varied human reality appears only as a definite form, as a determination of self-consciousness. But a mere determination of self-consciousness is a \u201cpure category, a mere \u201cthought\u201d which I can consequently also abolish in \u201cpure\u201d thought and overcome through pure thought. In Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology the material, perceptible, objective bases of the various estranged forms of human self-consciousness are left as they are. Thus the whole destructive work results in the most conservative philosophy because it thinks it has overcome the objective world, the sensuously real world, by merely transforming it into a \u201cthing of thought\u201d a mere determination of self-consciousness and can therefore dissolve its opponent, which has become ethereal, in the \u201cether of pure thought.\u201d Phenomenology is therefore quite logical when in the end it replaces human reality by \u201cAbsolute Knowledge\u201d\u2014Knowledge, because this is the only mode of existence of self-consciousness, because self-consciousness is considered as the only mode of existence of man; absolute knowledge for the very reason that self-consciousness knows itself alone and is no more disturbed by any objective world. Hegel makes man the man of self-consciousness instead of making self-consciousness the self-consciousness of man, of real man, man living in a real objective world and determined by that world. He stands the world on its head and can therefore dissolve in the head all the limitations which naturally remain in existence for evil sensuousness, for real man. Besides, everything which betrays the limitations of general self-consciousness\u2014all sensuousness, reality, individuality of men and of their world\u2014necessarily rates for him as a limit. The whole of Phenomenology is intended to prove that self-consciousness is the only reality and all reality.\u201d","Working men\u2019s Paris, with its Commune, will be forever celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society. Its martyrs are enshrined in the great heart of the working class. Its exterminators history has already nailed to that eternal pillory from which all the prayers of their priest will not avail to redeem them.","In money-lenders\u2019 capital the form M-C-M is reduced to the two extremes without a mean, M-M , money exchanged for more money, a form that is incompatible with the nature of money, and therefore remains inexplicable from the standpoint of the circulation of commodities. Hence Aristotle: \u201csince chrematistic is a double science, one part belonging to commerce, the other to economic, the latter being necessary and praiseworthy, the former based on circulation and with justice disapproved (for it is not based on Nature, but on mutual cheating), therefore the usurer is most rightly hated, because money itself is the source of his gain, and is not used for the purposes for which it was invented.","The new era differs from the old chiefly in that the lash begins to imagine itself possessed of genius.","Contempt for theory, art, history, and for man as an end in himself, which is contained in an abstract form in the Jewish religion, is the real, conscious standpoint, the virtue of the man of money. The species-relation itself, the relation between man and woman, etc., becomes an object of trade! The woman is bought and sold.","To say that \\"the worker has an interest in the rapid growth of capital\\"means only this; that the more speedily the worker augments the wealth of the capitalist, the larger will be the crumbs that fall down to him, the greater number of workers that can be called into existence, the more can the mass of slaves dependent on capital be increased.","The religious world is but the reflex of the real world. And for a society based upon the production of commodities, in which the producers in general enter into social relations with one another by treating their products as commodities and values, whereby they reduce their individual private labour to the standard of homogeneous human labour \u2013 for such a society, Christianity with its cultus of abstract man, more especially in its bourgeois developments, Protestantism, Deism, &c., is the most fitting form of religion.","In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity \u2014 the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed. And why? Because there is too much civilization, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce","Growth of productive capital and rise of wages, are they really, so indissolubly united as the bourgeois economists maintain? We must not believe their mere words. We dare not believe them even when they claim that the fatter capital is the more will its slave be pampered.","Tantae molis erat to unleash the \'eternal natural laws\' of the capitalist mode of production, to complete the process of separation between the workers and the conditions of their labour, to transform, at one pole, the social means of production and subsistence into capital, and at the opposite pole, the mass of the population into wage-labourers, into the free \'labouring poor\', that artificial product of modern history. If money, according to Augier, \'comes into the world with a congenital bloodstain on one cheek,\' capital comes dripping from head to toe, from every pore, with blood and dirt.","The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.","In a rational state it would be more appropriate to ensure that a cobbler passed an examination than an executive civil servant; because shoe-making is a craft in the absence of which it is still possible to be a good citizen and a man in society. But the necessary \'knowledge of the state\' is a precondition in the absence of which one lives outside the state, cut off from the air one breathes and from oneself. Thus the \'examination\' is nothing but a Masonic initiation, the legal recognition of the knowledge of citizenship, the acknowledgement of a privilege.This \'link\' between the \'individual\' and his \'office\', this objective bond between the knowledge of civil society and the knowledge of the state, namely the examination, is nothing but the bureaucratic baptism of knowledge, the official recognition of the transubstantiation of profane knowledge into sacred knowledge (it is plain that in every examination the examiner is omniscient).It is not recorded that Greek and Roman statesmen ever took examinations. But then what is a Roman statesman compared to a Prussian civil servant!","Die Proletarier dieser Welt haben nichts zu verlieren als ihre Ketten. Sie haben eine Welt zu gewinnen. Proletarier aller L\xe4nder, vereinigt euch!","Die Geschichte aller bisherigen Gesellschaft ist die Geschichte von Klassenk\xe4mpfen. Freier und Sklave, Patrizier und Plebejer, Baron und Leibeigener, Zunftb\xfcrger und Gesell, kurz, Unterdr\xfccker und Unterdr\xfcckte standen in stetem Gegensatz zueinander, f\xfchrten einen ununterbrochenen, bald versteckten, bald offenen Kampf, einen Kampf, der jedesmal mit einer revolution\xe4ren Umgestaltung der ganzen Gesellschaft endete oder mit dem gemeinsamen Untergang der k\xe4mpfenden Klassen.","Darwin has interested us in the history of Nature\u2019s Technology, i.e., in the formation of the organs of plants and animals, which organs serve as instruments of production for sustaining life. Does not the history of the productive organs of man, of organs that are the material basis of all social organisation, deserve equal attention? And would not such a history be easier to compile, since, as Vico says, human history differs from natural history in this, that we have made the former, but not the latter? Technology discloses man\u2019s mode of dealing with Nature, the process of production by which he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions that flow from them. Every history of religion, even, that fails to take account of this material basis, is uncritical. It is, in reality, much easier to discover by analysis the earthly core of the misty creations of religion, than, conversely, it is, to develop from the actual relations of life the corresponding celestialised forms of those relations. The latter method is the only materialistic, and therefore the only scientific one. The weak points in the abstract materialism of natural science, a materialism that excludes history and its process, are at once evident from the abstract and ideological conceptions of its spokesmen, whenever they venture beyond the bounds of their own speciality.[Chapter Fifteen: Machinery and Modern Industry; Footnote 4]","The less you eat, drink and buy books; the less you go to the theatre, the dance hall, the public house; the less you think, love, theorise, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save \u2013 the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor rust will devour \u2013 your capital. The less you are, the less you express your own life, the more you have, i.e., the greater is your alienated life, the greater is the store of your estranged being.","The Constitution, the National Assembly, the dynastic parties, the blue and the red republicans, the heroes of Africa, the thunder from the platform, the sheet lightning of the daily press, the entire literature, the political names and the intellectual reputations, the civil law and penal code, the libert\xe9, \xe9galit\xe9, fraternit\xe9 and the second of May 1852\u2014all have vanished like a phantasmagoria before the spell of a man whom even his enemies do not make out to be a magician. Universal suffrage seems to have survived only for a moment, in order that with its own hand it may make its last will and testament before the eyes of all the world and declare in the name of the people itself: Everything that exists has this much worth, that it will perish.","This class has always to sacrifice a part of itself in order not to be wholly destroyed.","The chief guide which must direct us in the choice of a profession is the welfare of mankind and our own perfection. It should not be thought that these two interests could be in conflict, that one would have to destroy the other; on the contrary, man\'s nature is so constituted that he can attain his own perfection only by working for the perfection, for the good, of his fellow men.If he works only for himself, he may perhaps become a famous man of learning, a great sage, an excellent poet, but he can never be a perfect, truly great man.History calls those men the greatest who have ennobled themselves by working for the common good; experience acclaims as happiest the man who has made the greatest number of people happy; religion itself teaches us that the ideal being whom all strive to copy sacrificed himself for the sake of mankind, and who would dare to set at nought such judgments?If we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually at work, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people.","The bourgeois during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together.","Marx himself makes it clear that he does not start from a basic concept \u2013 value \u2013 but from an elementary material phenomenon \u2013 the commodity \u2013 which is at the basis of capitalism, as the only economic organization based upon generalized commodity production.","because of Marx\u2019s capacity to discover the long-term laws of motion of the capitalist mode of production in its essence, irrespective of thousands of \u2018impurities\u2019 and of secondary aspects, that his long-term predictions \u2013 the laws of accumulation of capital, stepped-up technological progress, accelerated increase in the productivity and intensity of labour, growing concentration and centralization of capital, transformation of the great majority of economically active people into sellers of labour-power, declining rate of profit, increased rate of surplus value, periodically recurrent recessions, inevitable class struggle between Capital and Labour, increasing revolutionary attempts to overthrow capitalism \u2013 have been so strikingly confirmed by history.","The lower strata of the middle class\u2014the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants\u2014all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialized skill is rendered worthless by the new methods of production. Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.","The bloody mire of Mongolian slavery, not the rude glory of the Norman epoch, forms the cradle of Muscovy, and modern Russia is but a metamorphosis of Muscovy.","When a great social revolution shall have mastered the results of the bourgeois epoch, the market of the world and the modern powers of production, and subjected them to the common control of the most advanced peoples, then only will human progress cease to resemble that hideous pagan idol, who would not drink the nectar but from the skulls of the slain.","Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.","This false appearance distinguishes wages labour from other historical forms of labour. On the basis of the wages system even the unpaid labour seems to be paid labour. With the slave, on the contrary, even that part of his labour which is paid appears to be unpaid. Of course, in order to work the slave must live, and one part of his working day goes to replace the value of his own maintenance. But since no bargain is struck between him and his master, and no acts of selling and buying are going on between the two parties, all his labour seems to be given away for nothing.","If conquest constitutes a natural right on the part of the few, the many have only to gather sufficient strength in order to acquire the natural right of reconquering what has been taken from them","The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism of the weapon, material force must be overthrown by material force; but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses. Theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates ad hominem, and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp the root of the matter. But, for man, the root is man himself.","The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.","The very same bourgeois mentality which extols the manufacturing division of labour, the life-long annexation of the worker to a partial operation, and the unconditional subordination of the detail worker to capital, extols them as an organisation of labour which increases productivity - denounces just as loudly every kind of deliberate social control and regulation of the social process of production, denounces it as an invasion of the inviolable property rights, liberty and self-determining genius of the individual capitalist. It is characteristic that the inspired apologists of the factory system can find nothing worse to say of any proposal for the general organisation of social labour, than that it would transform the whole of society into a factory.","The progressive tendency of the general rate of profit to fall is, therefore, just an expression peculiar to the capitalist mode of production of the progressive development of the social productivity of labour. This does not mean to say that the rate of profit may not fall temporarily for other reasons. But proceeding from the nature of the capitalist mode of production, it is thereby proved a logical necessity that in its development the general average rate of surplus-value must express itself in a falling general rate of profit. Since the mass of the employed living labour is continually on the decline as compared to the mass of materialised labour set in motion by it, i.e., to the productively consumed means of production, it follows that the portion of living labour, unpaid and congealed in surplus-value, must also be continually on the decrease compared to the amount of value represented by the invested total capital. Since the ratio of the mass of surplus-value to the value of the invested total capital forms the rate of profit, this rate must constantly fall.","All mythology masters and dominates and shapes the forces of nature in and through the imagination; hence it disappears as soon as man gains mastery over the forces of nature","The bourgeoisie, in truth, is bound to fear the stupidity of the masses so long as they remain conservative, and the insight of the masses as soon as they become revolutionary.","Napoleon represented the last battle of revolutionary terror against the bourgeois society which had been proclaimed by this same Revolution, and against its policy. Napoleon, of course, already discerned the essence of the modern state; he understood that it is based on the unhampered development of bourgeois society, on the free movement of private interest, etc. He decided to recognise and protect this basis. He was no terrorist with his head in the clouds. Yet at the same time he still regarded the state as an end in itself and civil life only as a treasurer and his subordinate which must have no will of its own. He perfected the Terror by substituting permanent war for permanent revolution. He fed the egoism of the French nation to complete satiety but demanded also the sacrifice of bourgeois business, enjoyments, wealth, etc., whenever this was required by the political aim of conquest. If he despotically suppressed the liberalism of bourgeois society \u2014 the political idealism of its daily practice \u2014 he showed no more consideration for its essential material interests, trade and industry, whenever they conflicted with his political interests. His scorn of industrial hommes d\'affaires was the complement to his scorn of ideologists. In his home policy, too, he combated bourgeois society as the opponent of the state which in his own person he still held to be an absolute aim in itself. Thus he declared in the State Council that he would not suffer the owner of extensive estates to cultivate them or not as he pleased. Thus, too, he conceived the plan of subordinating trade to the state by appropriation of roulage [road haulage]. French businessmen took steps to anticipate the event that first shook Napoleon\u2019s power. Paris exchange- brokers forced him by means of an artificially created famine to delay the opening of the Russian campaign by nearly two months and thus to launch it too late in the year.","If now in considering the course of history we detach the ideas of the ruling class from the ruling class itself and attribute them to an independent existence, if we confine ourselves to saying that these or those ideas were dominant at a given time, without bothering ourselves about the conditions of production and the producers of these ideas, if we thus ignore the individuals and world conditions which are the source of the ideas, we can say, for instance, that during that time that the aristocracy was dominant, the concepts of honour, loyalty, etc. were dominant, during the dominance of the bourgeoisie the concepts freedom, equality, etc. The ruling class itself on the whole imagines this to be so. This conception of history, which is common to all historians, particularly since the eighteenth century, will necessarily come up against the phenomenon that increasingly abstract ideas hold sway, i.e. ideas which increasingly take on the form of universality. For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it, is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society, that is, expressed in ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of universality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones.","But money itself is a commodity, an external object, capable of becoming the private property of any individual. Thus social power becomes the private power of private persons. The ancients therefore denounced money as subversive of the economic and moral order of things.[106] Modern society, which, soon after its birth, pulled Plutus by the hair of his head from the bowels of the earth,[107] greets gold as its Holy Grail, as the glittering incarnation of the very principle of its own life.","The sum of productive forces, capital funds and social forms of intercourse, which every individual and generation finds in existence as something given, is the real basis of what the philosophers have conceived as \\"substance\\" and \\"essence of man,\\" and what they have deified and attacked: a real basis which is not in the least disturbed, in its effect and influence on the development of men, by the fact that these philosophers revolt against it as \\"self-consciousness\\" and the \\"Unique.","This demand to change consciousness amounts to a demand to interpret reality in another way, i.e., to recognise it by means of another interpretation....They forget however, that to these phrases they themselves are only opposing other phrases, and that they are in no way combating the real existing world when they are merely combating the phrases of this world.","Hitherto philosophers have had the solution of all riddles lying in their writing-desks, and the stupid, exoteric world had only to open its mouth for the roast pigeons of absolute knowledge to fly into it. Now philosophy has become mundane, and the most striking proof of this is that philosophical consciousness itself has been drawn into the torment of the struggle, not only externally but also internally. But, if constructing the future and settling everything for all times are not our affair, it is all the more clear what we have to accomplish at present: I am referring to ruthless criticism of all that exists, ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be.","Ji bil\xee zinc\xeer\xean xwe ti\u015ftek\xee ku proleter ji dest bidin n\xeen e.

Thus, urged on by want, he himself multiplies the disastrous effects of division of labour. The result is: the more he works, the less wages he receives. And for this simple reason: the more he works, the more he competes against his fellow workmen, the more he compels them to compete against him, and to offer themselves on the same wretched conditions as he does so that, in the last analysis, he competes against himself as a member of the working class.","The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians\' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves.

There are only two kinds of institutions for them, artificial and natural. The institutions of feudalism are artificial institutions, those of the bourgeoisie are natural institutions. In this, they resemble the theologians, who likewise establish two kinds of religion. Every religion which is not theirs is an invention of men, while their own is an emanation from God. When the economists say that present-day relations \u2014 the relations of bourgeois production \u2014 are natural, they imply that these are the relations in which wealth is created and productive forces developed in conformity with the laws of nature. These relations therefore are themselves natural laws independent of the influence of time. They are eternal laws which must always govern society. Thus, there has been history, but there is no longer any. There has been history, since there were the institutions of feudalism, and in these institutions of feudalism we find quite different relations of production from those of bourgeois society, which the economists try to pass off as natural and as such, eternal.","Men [sic] make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.(Marx, 1963)","The working men have no country.

It is the same in religion. The more man puts into God, the less he retains in himself. The worker puts his life into the object; but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object. Hence, the greater this activity, the more the worker lacks objects. Whatever the product of his labor is, he is not. Therefore, the greater the product, the less is he himself. The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him. It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.","Az biraz tarih bilen herkes b\xfcy\xfck sosyal devrimlerin kad\u0131nlar\u0131n kat\u0131l\u0131m\u0131 olmadan ger\xe7ekle\u015femeyece\u011fini bilir.

From this aspect alone, therefore, this appropriation must have a universal character corresponding to the productive forces and the intercourse.","All earlier revolutionary appropriations were restricted; individuals, whose self-activity was restricted by a crude instrument of production and a limited intercourse, appropriated this crude instrument of production, and hence merely achieved a new state of limitation. Their instrument of production became their property, but they themselves remained subordinate to the division of labour and their own instrument of production. In all expropriations up to now, a mass of individuals remained subservient to a single instrument of production; in the appropriation by the proletarians, a mass of instruments of production must be made subject to each individual, and property to all.

Those rules, logical deductions from the nature of the parties and the circumstances one has to deal with in such a case, are so plain and simple that the short experience of 1848 had made the Germans pretty well acquainted with them. Firstly, never play with insurrection unless you are fully prepared to face the consequences of your play. Insurrection is a calculus with very indefinite magnitudes, the value of which may change every day; the forces opposed to you have all the advantage of organization, discipline, and habitual authority: unless you bring strong odds against them you are defeated and ruined. Secondly, the insurrectionary career once entered upon, act with the greatest determination, and on the offensive. The defensive is the death of every armed rising; it is lost before it measures itself with its enemies. Surprise your antagonists while their forces are scattering, prepare new successes, however small, but daily; keep up the moral ascendancy which the first successful rising has given to you; rally those vacillating elements to your side which always follow the strongest impulse, and which always look out for the safer side; force your enemies to a retreat before they can collect their strength against you; in the words of Danton, the greatest master of revolutionary policy yet known, de l\'audace, de l\'audace, encore de l\'audace!","The foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion does not make man. Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man \u2013 state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d\u2019honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion. Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo. Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself. It is, therefore, the task of history, once the other-world of truth has vanished, to establish the truth of this world. It is the immediate task of philosophy, which is in the service of history, to unmask self-estrangement in its unholy forms once the holy form of human self-estrangement has been unmasked. Thus, the criticism of Heaven turns into the criticism of Earth, the criticism of religion into the criticism of law, and the criticism of theology into the criticism of politics.","Religion is the moan of the oppressed creature, the sentiment of a heartless world, as it is the spirit of spiritless conditions. It is the opium of the people.","The desire after hoarding is in its very nature unsatiable. In its qualitative aspect, or formally considered, money has no bounds to its efficacy, i.e., it is the universal representative of material wealth, because it is directly convertible into any other commodity. But, at the same time, every actual sum of money is limited in amount, and, therefore, as a means of purchasing, has only a limited efficacy. This antagonism between the quantitative limits of money and its qualitative boundlessness, continually acts as a spur to the hoarder in his Sisyphus-like labour of accumulating. It is with him as it is with a conqueror who sees in every new country annexed, only a new boundary.","A people which subjugates another people forges its own chains.","That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a mere training to act as a machine.","philosophers have only interpreted the world; the point however, is to change it","Die Geschichte ist die wahre Naturgeschichte des Menschen.","There is a specter haunting Europe, the specter of Communism.","Democracy is the road to Socialism.","A house may be large or small; as long as the surrounding houses are equally small it satisfies all social demands for a dwelling. If a palace rises besides the little house, the little house shrinks into a hut.","The Proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.","The use-value of labour-power, or in other words, labour, belongs just as little to its seller, as the use-value of oil after it has been sold belongs to the dealer who has sold it.","The essential difference between the various economic forms of society, between, for instance, a society based on slave-labour, and one based on wage-labour, lies only in the mode in which this surplus-labour is in each case extracted from the actual producer, the labourer. [6]","But the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it forits own purposes.","Hence the enigmatical character of the equivalent form which escapes the notice of the bourgeois political economist, until this form, completely developed, confronts him in the shape of money.","Criticism has torn up the imaginary flowers from the chain not so that man shall wear the unadorned, bleak chain but so that he will shake off the chain and pluck the living flower.","You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population","Cuanto m\xe1s lejos nos remontamos en la historia, tanto m\xe1s aparece el individuo - y por consiguiente tambi\xe9n el individuo productor - como dependiente y formando parte de un todo mayor: en primer lugar y de una manera todav\xeda muy enteramente natural, de la familia y de esa familia ampliada que es la tribu; m\xe1s tarde, de las comunidades en sus distintas formas, resultado del antagonismo y de la fusi\xf3n de las tribus. Solamente al llegar el Siglo XVIII, con la \\"sociedad civil\\", las diferentes formas de conexi\xf3n social aparecen ante el individuo como un simple medio para lograr sus fines privados, como una necesidad exterior. Pero la \xe9poca que genera este punto de vista, esta idea del individuo aislado, es precisamente aquella en la cual las relaciones sociales (universales seg\xfan este punto de vista) han llegado al m\xe1s alto grado de desarrollo alcanzado hasta el presente. El hombre es, en el sentido m\xe1s literal, un zoon politikon, no solamente un animal social, sino un animal que s\xf3lo puede individualizarse en la sociedad. La producci\xf3n por parte de un individuo aislado, fuera de la sociedad - hecho raro que bien puede ocurrir cuando un civilizado, que potencialmente posee ya en s\xed las fuerzas de la sociedad, se extrav\xeda accidentalmente en una comarca salvaje - no es menos absurda que la idea de un desarrollo del lenguaje sin individuos que vivan juntos y hablen entre s\xed.","So a god has snatched from me my allIn the curse and rack of Destiny.All his worlds are gone beyond recall!Nothing but revenge is left to me!On myself revenge I\u2019ll proudly wreak,On that being, that enthroned Lord,Make my strength a patchwork of what\u2019s weak,Leave my better self without reward!I shall build my throne high overhead,Cold, tremendous shall its summit be.For its bulwark-- superstitious dread,For its Marshall--blackest agony.Who looks on it with a healthy eye,Shall turn back, struck deathly pale and dumb;Clutched by blind and chill MortalityMay his happiness prepare its tomb.And the Almighty\u2019s lightning shall reboundFrom that massive iron giant.If he bring my walls and towers down,Eternity shall raise them up, defiant.","With a given volume of capital advanced, the scale of production grows, and hence, with a given rate of surplus-value, the absolute mass of the surplus-value produced in one turnover period also grows, and there occurs, simultaneously with this, a rise in the annual rate of surplus-value caused by the reduction in the reproduction period.","Since elements of productive capital are constantly being withdrawn from the market and all that is put into the market is an equivalent in money, the effective demand rises, without this in itself providing any element of supply.","The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.","The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.","The Tories in England long imagined that they were enthusiastic about monarchy, the church, and the beauties of the old English Constitution, until the day of danger wrung from them the confession that they are enthusiastic only about ground rent.","I laugh at the so-called \'practical\' people and their wisdom.

It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.","The demands of the Paris proletariat are utopian nonsense, to which an end must be put.","El proceso acaba siempre sustrayendo a la circulaci\xf3n m\xe1s dinero del que a ella se lanz\xf3.

As they have done so, moreover, not only have material wealth and the possibilities for freeing mankind definitively from the burden of meaningless, repetitive and mechanical work increased, but so too has the polarization of society between fewer and fewer owners of capital and more and more workers of hand and brain, forced to sell their labour-power to these owners.","Every product of labour is, in all states of society, a use value; but it is only at a definite historical epoch in a society\u2019s development that such a product becomes a commodity, viz., at the epoch when the labour spent on the production of a useful article becomes expressed as one of the objective qualities of that article, i.e., as its value. It therefore follows that the elementary value form is also the primitive form under which a product of labour appears historically as a commodity, and that the gradual transformation of such products into commodities, proceeds pari passu with the development of the value form.","Although the German workers cannot come to power and achieve the realization of their class interests without passing through a protracted revolutionary development, this time they can at least be certain that the first act of the approaching revolutionary drama will coincide with the direct victory of their own class in France and will thereby be accelerated. But they themselves must contribute most to their final victory, by informing themselves of their own class interests, by taking up their independent political position as soon as possible, by not allowing themselves to be misled by the hypocritical phrases of the democratic petty bourgeoisie into doubting for one minute the necessity of an independently organized party of the proletariat. Their battle-cry must be: The Permanent Revolution.\\"----Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League.

When Christian ideas succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge.","In place of the old wants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature.","Una assenza momentanea fa bene, perch\xe9 quando si \xe8 presenti le cose sembrano troppo uguali per distinguerle.

Profit and wages remain as before, in inverse proportion.","This organisation of the proletarians into a class, and, consequently into a political party, is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves. But it ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.","There can be no doubt\u2013and this very fact has led to false conceptions\u2013that the great revolutions that took place in trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, along with the geographical discoveries of that epoch, and which rapidly advanced the development of commercial capital, were a major moment in promoting the transition from the feudal to the capitalist mode of production. The sudden expansion of the world market, the multiplication of commodities in circulation, the competition among the European nations for the seizure of Asiatic products and American treasures, the colonial system, all made a fundamental contribution towards shattering the feudal barriers to production. And yet the modern mode of production in its first period, that of manufacture, developed only where the conditions for it had been created in the Middle Ages. Compare Holland with Portugal, for example.49 And whereas in the sixteenth century, and partly still in the seventeenth, the sudden expansion of trade and the creation of a new world market had an overwhelming influence on the defeat of the old mode of production and the rise of the capitalist mode, this happened in reverse on the basis of the capitalist mode of production, once it had been created. The world market itself forms the basis for this mode of production. On the other hand, the immanent need that this has to produce on an ever greater scale drives it to the constant expansion of the world market, so that now it is not trade that revolutionizes industry, but rather industry that constantly revolutionizes trade. Moreover, commercial supremacy is now linked with the greater or lesser prevalence of the conditions for large-scale industry. Compare England and Holland, for example. The history of Holland\u2019s decline as the dominant trading nation is the history of the subordination of commercial capital to industrial capital.

For example, the same quantity of labour is present in eight bushels of corn in favourable seasons and in only four bushels in unfavourable seasons. The same quantity of labour provides more metal in rich mines than in poor. Diamonds are of very rare occurrence on the earth\u2019s surface, and hence their discovery costs, on an average, a great deal of labour-time.","Furthermore, to the same degree in which the division of labour increases, is the labour simplified. The special skill of the labourer becomes worthless. He becomes transformed into a simple monotonous force of production, with neither physical nor mental elasticity. His work becomes accessible to all; therefore competitors press upon him from all sides. Moreover, it must be remembered that the more simple, the more easily learned the work is, so much the less is its cost of production, the expense of its acquisition, and so much the lower must the wages sink\u2014for, like the price of any other commodity, they are determined by the cost of production. Therefore, in the same measure in which labour becomes more unsatisfactory, more repulsive, do competition increase and wages decrease.","The economists tell us, to be sure, that those labourers who have been rendered superfluous by machinery find new avenues of employment, They dare not assert directly that the same labourers that have been discharged find situations in new branches of labour. Facts cry out too loudly against this lie. Strictly speaking, they only maintain that new means of employment will be found for other sections of the working class; for example, for that portion of the young generation of labourers who were about to enter upon that branch of industry which had just been abolished.

Do you mean the property of the petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.Or do you mean modern bourgeois private property?But does wage labor create any property for the laborer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage-labor, and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labor for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labor. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production. Capital is a collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.Capital is therefore not a personal, it is a social power.","The values of commodities are directly as the times of labour employed in their production, and are inversely as the productive powers of the labour employed.","To sum up: the more productive capital grows, the more it extends the division of labour and the application of machinery; the more the division of labour and the application of machinery extend, the more does competition extend among the workers, the more do their wages shrink together.","The executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.","Pero advi\xe9rtase que aqu\xed s\xf3lo nos referimos a las personas en cuanto personificaci\xf3n de categor\xedas econ\xf3micas, como representantes de determinados intereses y relaciones de clase.","Burjuvazi, tarihsel olarak, son derece devrimci bir rol oynam\u0131\u015ft\u0131r.Burjuvazi, y\xf6netimi ele ge\xe7irdi\u011fi her yerde, t\xfcm feodal, ataerkil ve k\u0131rsal ili\u015fkilere son vermi\u015ftir. \u0130nsano\u011flunu \u201cdo\u011fal efendilerine ba\u011fl\u0131 k\u0131lan \xe7apra\u015f\u0131k feodal ba\u011flar\u0131 ac\u0131mas\u0131zca kesip atm\u0131\u015f, insanla insan aras\u0131nda kat\u0131ks\u0131z \xe7\u0131kardan, kat\u0131 \u201cnakit \xf6deme\u201dden18 ba\u015fka bir ba\u011f b\u0131rakmam\u0131\u015ft\u0131r.

In these crises there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity\u2014the epidemic of overproduction. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? because there is too much civilization, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.","The capitalist buys labour-power in order to use it; and labour-power in use is labour itself. The purchaser of labour-power consumes it by setting the seller of it to work. By working, the latter becomes actually, what before he only was potentially, labour-power in action, a labourer. In order that his labour may re-appear in a commodity, he must, before all things, expend it on something useful, on something capable of satisfying a want of some sort. Hence, what the capitalist sets the labourer to produce, is a particular use-value, a specified article.","All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations.","The premises from which we begin are not arbitrary ones, not dogmas, but real premises from which abstraction can only be made in the imagination. They are the real individuals, their activity and the material conditions under which they live, both those which they find already existing and those produced by their activity. These premises can thus be verified in a purely empirical way.","A second and more practical, but less systematic, form of this Socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class, by showing that no mere political reform, but only a change in the material conditions of existence, in economic relations, could be of any advantage to them. By changes in the material conditions of existence, this form of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be effected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based on the continued existence of these relations; reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and simplify the administrative work, of bourgeois government.","In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class, developed; a class of laborers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labor increases capital. These laborers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.","No es la m\xe1quina la que trabaja, sino que se trabaja en ella, para restaurar su valor de uso.","By buying the power of the workman, the capitalist has, therefore, acquired the right to use of make that labouring power during the whole day or week.","M\u2013L is the characteristic moment of the transformation of money capital into productive capital, for it is the essential condition without which the value advanced in the money form cannot really be transformed into capital, into value-producing surplus-value. M\u2013mp is necessary only in order to realize the mass of labour bought by way of M\u2013L.","Religion is the self-consciousness and self-regard of man who has either not yet found or has already lost himself","Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty bourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a bourgeois. The modern laborer, on the contrary, instead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth. And here it becomes evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law. It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its existence is no longer compatible with society.","because in the form of wages labour is bought with money, and this is taken as the characteristic feature of a \u2018money economy\u2019.","The irrationality consists in the fact that labour as the value-forming element cannot itself possess any value, and so a certain quantity of labour cannot have a value that is expressed in its price, in its equivalence with a certain definite quantity of money.","It is a pure tautology to say that crises are provoked by a lack of effective demand or effective consumption. The capitalist system does not recognize any forms of consumer other than those who can pay, if we exclude the consumption of paupers and swindlers. The fact that commodities are unsaleable means no more than that no effective buyers have been found for them, i.e. no consumers (no matter whether the commodities are ultimately sold to meet the needs of productive or individual consumption).","Toda la historia de la sociedad humana, hasta la actualidad , es una historia de luchas de clases. Libres y esclavos, patricios y plebeyos, barones y siervos de la gleba, maestros y oficiales; en una palabra, opresores y oprimidos, frente a frente siempre, empe\xf1ados en una lucha ininterrumpida, velada unas veces, y otras franca y abierta, en una lucha que conduce en cada etapa a la transformaci\xf3n revolucionaria de todo el r\xe9gimen social o al exterminio de ambas clases beligerantes.","All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind.","But in its blind unrestrainable passion, its werewolf hunger for surplus-labor, capital oversteps not only the moral, but even the merely physical maximum bounds of the working-day. It usurps the time for growth, development, and healthy maintenance of the body. It steals the time required for the consumption of fresh air and sunlight. It higgles over a meal-time, incorporating it where possible with the process of production itself, so that food is given to the laborer as to a mere means of production, as coal is supplied to the boiler, grease and oil to the machinery. It reduces the sound sleep needed for the restoration, reparation, refreshment of the bodily powers. \u2026Capital cares nothing for the length of life of labor-power. All that concerns it is simply and solely the maximum of labor-power, that can be rendered fluent in a working-day. It attains this end by shortening the extent of the laborer\u2019s life, as a greedy farmer snatches increased produce from the soil by robbing it of its fertility.","Money is the universal equivalent form of all commodities, which already show in their prices that they ideally represent a specific sum of money, expect to be transformed into money, and only receive the form in which they can be converted into use-values for their possessor by changing places with money.","Le pouvoir politique, \xe0 proprement parler, est le pouvoir organis\xe9 d\u2019une classe pour l\u2019oppression d\u2019une autre.","Horrorizai-vos porque queremos abolir a propriedade privada. Mas em vossa sociedade a propriedade privada est\xe1 abolida para nove d\xe9cimos de seus membros.","What is characteristic is not that the commodity labour-power can be bought, but the fact that labour-power appears as a commodity.","Capital Marx\u2019s fundamental aim was to lay bare the laws of motion which govern the origins, the rise, the development, the decline and the disappearance of a given social form of economic organization: the capitalist mode of production. He was not seeking universal laws of economic organization. Indeed, one of the essential theses of Capital is that no such laws exist. For Marx, there are no economic laws valid for each and every basically different form of society","It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life.","History is thorough, and passes through many phases when it bears an old figure to the grave. The last phase of a world historical figure is its comedy.","One must force the frozen circumstances to dance, by singing to them their own melody.","Truth is general, it does not belong to me alone, it belongs to all, it owns me, I do not own it. My property is the form, which is my spiritual individuality.","What are the mundane principles of Judaism? Practical necessity and the pursuit of one\'s own advantage. What is its earthly god? Money. The Jew has emancipated himself in a typically Jewish fashion not only in that he has taken control of the power of money, but also in that through him, money has become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the spirit of the Christian people. The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews. The god of the Jews has become secularized and has become the god of the earth. The exchange is the true god of the Jews.","The class-struggles of the ancient world took the form chiefly of a contest between debtors and creditors, which in Rome ended in the ruin of the plebeian debtors. They were displaced by slaves. In the middle ages the contest ended with the ruin of the feudal debtors, who lost their political power together with the economic basis on which it was established. Nevertheless, the money relation of debtor and creditor that existed at these two periods reflected only the deeper-lying antagonism between the general economic conditions of existence of the classes in question.","The specific economic form, in which unpaid surplus-labour is pumped out of direct producers, determines the relationship of rulers and ruled, as it grows directly out of production itself and, in turn, reacts upon it as a determining element. Upon this, however, is founded the entire formation of the economic community which grows up out of the production relations themselves, thereby simultaneously its specific political form. It is always the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers \u2014 a relation always naturally corresponding to a definite stage in the development of the methods of labour and thereby its social productivity \u2014 which reveals the innermost secret, the hidden basis of the entire social structure and with it the political form of the relation of sovereignty and dependence, in short, the corresponding specific form of the state. This does not prevent the same economic basis \u2014 the same from the standpoint of its main conditions \u2014 due to innumerable different empirical circumstances, natural environment, racial relations, external historical influences, etc. from showing infinite variations and gradations in appearance, which can be ascertained only by analysis of the empirically given circumstances.","Abolid la explotaci\xf3n del hombre por el hombrey habr\xe9is abolido la explotaci\xf3n de una naci\xf3n porotra.","The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer. They merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of Communism. All property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions. The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property. The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few. In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property. We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man\'s own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.","In a future society, in which class antagonism will have ceased, in which there will no longer be any classes, use will no longer be determined by the minimum time of production; but the time of social production devoted to different articles will be determined by the degree of their social utility.","Theory becomes realized among a people only in so far as it represents the realization of that people\'s needs.","Man makes religion, religion does not make Man","It was intended as an explanation of what would happen to labour, machinery, technology, the size of enterprises, the social structure of the population, the discontinuity of economic growth, and the relations between workers and work, as the capitalist mode of production unfolded all its terrifying potential.","The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of subsistence, which is absolutely requisite in bare existence as a labourer. What, therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence. We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others. All that we want to do away with, is the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it.","El ej\xe9rcito cuyas tropas se pegan menos entre s\xed es el que triunfa sobre el otro.","the basic social classes of bourgeois society in a separate way: first the industrial capitalists; then the landowners; finally the proletariat.","Cependant, pour les pays les plus avanc\xe9s, les mesures suivantes pourront assez g\xe9n\xe9ralement \xeatre applicables : 1 \u030aExpropriation de la propri\xe9t\xe9 fonci\xe8re et confiscation de la rente fonci\xe8re au profit de l\u2019Etat. 2 \u030aImp\xf4t fortement progressif. 3 \u030aAbolition de l\u2019h\xe9ritage. 4 \u030aConfiscation de la propri\xe9t\xe9 de tous les \xe9migrants et de tous les rebelles. 5 \u030aCentralisation du cr\xe9dit dans les mains de l\u2019Etat au moyen d\u2019une banque nationale, avec capital de l\u2019Etat, et avec le monopole exclusif. 6 \u030aCentralisation dans les mains de l\u2019Etat de tous les moyens de transport. 7 \u030aAugmentation des manufactures nationales et des instruments de production, d\xe9frichement des terrains incultes et am\xe9lioration des terres cultiv\xe9es d\u2019apr\xe8s un syst\xe8me g\xe9n\xe9ral.8 \u030aTravail obligatoire pour tous, organisation d\u2019arm\xe9es industrielles, particuli\xe8rement pour l\u2019agriculture.9 \u030aCombinaison du travail agricole et industriel, ; mesures tendant \xe0 faire dispara\xeetre la distinction entre ville et campagne. 10 \u030aEducation publique et gratuite de tous les enfants, abolition du travail des enfants dans les fabriques tel qu\u2019il est pratiqu\xe9 aujourd\u2019hui.

Meanwhile the antagonism between proletariat and the bourgeoisie is a struggle of class against class, a struggle which carried to its highest expression is total revolution. Indeed, is it at all surprising that a society founded on the opposition of classes should culminate in brutal contradiction, the shock of body against body, as its final d\xe9nouement?  Do not say that social movement excludes political movement. There is never a political movement which is not at the same time social.  It is only in an order of things in which there are no more classes and class antagonisms that social evolutions will cease to be political revolutions. Till then, on the eve of every general reshuffling of society, the last word of social science will always be:","They cannot represent themselves; they must be represented.","The charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of serious examination.Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man\'s ideas, views, and conceptions, in one word, man\'s consciousness changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life?What else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.When people speak of ideas that revolutionize society they do but express the fact that within the old society the elements of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.When the ancient world was in its last throes the ancient religions were overcome by Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed in the eighteenth century to rationalist ideas, feudal society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge.\\"Undoubtedly,\\" it will be said, \\"religious, moral, philosophical and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development. But religion, morality, philosophy, political science, and law, constantly survived this change.\\"There are besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.\\"What does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs.But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, viz., they exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays, moves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms.","If the State is to have reality as the ethical, self-conscious realization of spirit, it must be distinguished from the form of authority and faith. But this distinction arises only in so far as the ecclesiastical side is in itself divided into several churches.

But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of the machinery, etc.","Man is the highest essence of man, hence with the categorical imperative to overthrow all relations in which man is a debased, enslaved, abandoned, despicable essence.","The introduction of free competition is thus public declaration that from now on the members of society are unequal only to the extent that their capitals are unequal, that capital is the decisive power, and that therefore the capitalists, the bourgeoisie, have become the first class in society.","The immediate aim of the Communist is the same as that of all the other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat","The highest point reached by contemplative [anschauende] materialism, that is, materialism which does not comprehend sensuousness as practical activity, is the contemplation of single individuals and of civil society [b\xfcrgerlichen Gesellschaft].","Since the mass of the employed living labour is continually on the decline as compared to the mass of materialised labour set in motion by it, i.e., to the productively consumed means of production, it follows that the portion of living labour, unpaid and congealed in surplus-value, must also be continually on the decrease compared to the amount of value represented by the invested total capital. Since the ratio of the mass of surplus-value to the value of the invested total capital forms the rate of profit, this rate must constantly fall.","In truth, however, value is here the active factor in a process, in which, while constantly assuming the form in turn of money and commodities, it at the same time changes in magnitude, differentiates itself by throwing off surplus value from itself; the original value, in other words, expands spontaneously. For the movement, in the course of which it adds surplus value, is its own movement, its expansion, therefore, is automatic expansion. Because it is value, it has acquired the occult quality of being able to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs.","Die Gesamtheit dieser Produktionsverh\xe4ltnisse bildet die \xf6konomische Struktur der Gesellschaft, die reale Basis, worauf sich ein juristischer und politischer \xdcberbau erhebt und welcher bestimmte gesellschaftliche Bewu\xdftseinsformen entsprechen. Die Produktionsweise des materiellen Lebens bedingt den sozialen, politischen und geistigen Lebensproze\xdf \xfcberhaupt. Es ist nicht das Bewu\xdftsein der Menschen, das ihr Sein, sondern umgekehrt ihr gesellschaftliches Sein, das ihr Bewu\xdftsein bestimmt.

It is conditioned by the physical properties of the commodity, and has no existence apart from the latter. It is therefore the physical body of the commodity itself, for instance iron, corn, a diamond, which is the use-value or useful thing. This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities.","Philosophy and the study of the actual world have the same relation to one another as masturbation and sexual love.","Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.","Sie wissen das nicht, aber sie tun es.","From the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital, from that moment, you say individuality vanishes.","Jeder Schritt wirklicher Bewegung ist wichtiger als ein Dutzend Programme.","In point of fact, however, whether a man works three days of the week for himself on his own field and three days for nothing on the estate of his lord, or whether he works in the factory or the workshop six hours daily for himself and six for his employer, comes to the same, although in the latter case the paid and unpaid portions of labour are inseparably mixed up with each other, and the nature of the whole transaction is completely masked by the intervention of a contract and the pay received at the end of the week. The gratuitous labour appears to be voluntarily given in the one instance, and to be compulsory in the other. That makes all the difference.","Non c\u2019\xe8 via maestra per la scienza, e solo hanno una probabilit\xe0 di raggiungerne le vette luminose coloro che non temono di affaticarsi a salirne i ripidi sentieri.","History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce","every class struggle is a political struggle.","The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.","They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments of production themselves; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages.","A use-value, or useful article, therefore, has value only because abstract human labour is objectified or materialized in it. How, then, is the magnitude of this value to be measured? By means of the quantity of the \\"value-forming substance\\", the labour, contained in the article. This quantity is measured by its duration, and the labour-time is itself measured on the particular scale of hours, days etc.","Consequently, labour-power is a commodity which its possessor, the wage-worker, sells to the capitalist. Why does he sell it? It is in order to live.But the putting of labour-power into action \u2013 i.e., the work \u2013 is the active expression of the labourer\'s own life. And this life activity he sells to another person in order to secure the necessary means of life. His life-activity, therefore, is but a means of securing his own existence. He works that he may keep alive. He does not count the labour itself as a part of his life; it is rather a sacrifice of his life. It is a commodity that he has auctioned off to another. The product of his activity, therefore, is not the aim of his activity. What he produces for himself is not the silk that he weaves, not the gold that he draws up the mining shaft, not the palace that he builds. What he produces for himself is wages; and the silk, the gold, and the palace are resolved for him into a certain quantity of necessaries of life, perhaps into a cotton jacket, into copper coins, and into a basement dwelling. And the labourer who for 12 hours long, weaves, spins, bores, turns, builds, shovels, breaks stone, carries hods, and so on \u2013 is this 12 hours\' weaving, spinning, boring, turning, building, shovelling, stone-breaking, regarded by him as a manifestation of life, as life? Quite the contrary. Life for him begins where this activity ceases, at the table, at the tavern, in bed. The 12 hours\' work, on the other hand, has no meaning for him as weaving, spinning, boring, and so on, but only as earnings, which enable him to sit down at a table, to take his seat in the tavern, and to lie down in a bed.","there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.","The same cause which may increase the [net] revenue of the country\u2019 (i.e., as Ricardo explains in the same passage, \u2018the revenues of landlords and capitalists\u2019, whose wealth, from the economic point of view, is equivalent to the wealth of the nation), \u2018may at the same time render the population redundant and deteriorate the condition of the labourer\u2019 (Ricardo, op. cit., p. 469). \u2018The constant aim and the tendency of every improvement in machinery is, in fact, to do away entirely with the labour of man, or to lessen its price by substituting the labour of women and children for that of grown-up men, or of unskilled for that of skilled workmen\u2019 (Ure, op. cit., p. 23).","Labour-power was not always a commodity (merchandise). Labour was not always wage-labour, i.e., free labour. The slave did not sell his labour-power to the slave-owner, any more than the ox sells his labour to the farmer. The slave, together with his labour-power, was sold to his owner once for all. He is a commodity that can pass from the hand of one owner to that of another. He himself is a commodity, but his labour-power is not his commodity. The serf sells only a portion of his labour-power. It is not he who receives wages from the owner of the land; it is rather the owner of the land who receives a tribute from him. The serf belongs to the soil, and to the lord of the soil he brings its fruit. The free labourer, on the other hand, sells his very self, and that by fractions. He auctions off eight, 10, 12, 15 hours of his life, one day like the next, to the highest bidder, to the owner of raw materials, tools, and the means of life \u2013 i.e., to the capitalist. The labourer belongs neither to an owner nor to the soil, but eight, 10, 12, 15 hours of his daily life belong to whomsoever buys them. The worker leaves the capitalist, to whom he has sold himself, as often as he chooses, and the capitalist discharges him as often as he sees fit, as soon as he no longer gets any use, or not the required use, out of him. But the worker, whose only source of income is the sale of his labour-power, cannot leave the whole class of buyers, i.e., the capitalist class, unless he gives up his own existence. He does not belong to this or that capitalist, but to the capitalist class; and it is for him to find his man \u2013 i.e., to find a buyer in this capitalist class.","How, \u2018then, does a sum of commodities, of exchange values, become capital? Thereby, that as an independent social power, i. e., as the power of a part of society, it preserves itself and multiplies by exchange with direct, living labor-power.The existence of a class which possesses nothing but the ability to work is a necessary presupposition of capital.It is only the dominion of past, accumulated, materialized labor over immediate living labor that stamps the accumulated labor with the character of capital.Capital does not consist in the fact that accumulated labor serves living labor as a means for new production. It consists in the fact that living labor serves accumulated labor as the means of preserving and multiplying its exchange value.","If a man got two shillings weekly wages, and if his wages rose to four shillings, the rate of wages would have risen by 100 per cent. This would seem a very magnificent thing if expressed as a rise in the rate of wages, although the actual amount of wages, four shillings weekly, would still remain a wretchedly small, a starvation, pittance. You must not, therefore, allow yourselves to be carried away by the high-sounding per cents in the rate of wages. You must always ask: What was the original amount?","La riqueza de las sociedades en las que domina el modo de producci\xf3n capitalista se presenta como un \\"enorme c\xfamulo de mercanc\xedas\\", y la mercanc\xeda individual como la forma elemental de esa riqueza","In place of the old wants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes.","The head of this emancipation is philosophy; its heart is the proletariat. Philosophy cannot be realized without the abolition of the proletariat, the proletariat cannot abolish itself without realizing philosophy.","And this is the economic constitution of our entire modern society: the working class alone produces all values. For value is only another expression for labour, that expression, namely, by which is designated, in our capitalist society of today, the amount of socially necessary labour embodied in a particular commodity. But, these values produced by the workers do not belong to the workers. They belong to the owners of the raw materials, machines, tools, and money, which enable them to buy the labour-power of the working class. Hence, the working class gets back only a part of the entire mass of products produced by it. And, as we have just seen, the other portion, which the capitalist class retains, and which it has to share, at most, only with the landlord class, is increasing with every new discovery and invention, while the share which falls to the working class (per capita) rises but little and very slowly, or not at all, and under certain conditions it may even fall.","Every step of real movement is more important than a dozen programmes.","The history of all hitherto existing society8 is the history of class struggles.","\u0130\u015f\xe7i s\u0131n\u0131f\u0131n\u0131n \xe7al\u0131\u015fmakta olan k\u0131sm\u0131n\u0131n a\u015f\u0131r\u0131 \xe7al\u0131\u015fmas\u0131, i\u015f\xe7i s\u0131n\u0131f\u0131n\u0131n yedek k\u0131sm\u0131n\u0131 b\xfcy\xfct\xfcrken, di\u011fer taraftan, yedekte bulunan k\u0131sm\u0131n rekabet yoluyla \xe7al\u0131\u015fmakta olan k\u0131s\u0131m \xfczerinde yaratt\u0131\u011f\u0131 bask\u0131n\u0131n artmas\u0131, \xe7al\u0131\u015fmakta olan i\u015f\xe7ileri a\u015f\u0131r\u0131 \xe7al\u0131\u015fmak ve sermayenin diktas\u0131na boyun e\u011fmek zorunda b\u0131rak\u0131r.","Burjuva toplumunda, her insan\u0131n meta al\u0131c\u0131s\u0131 olarak meta hakk\u0131nda ansiklopedik bilgi sahibi oldu\u011fu fictio juris\u2019i (varsay\u0131m\u0131) egemendir.","Hegel dice en alguna parte que todos los grandes hechos y personajes de la historia universal aparecen, como si dij\xe9ramos, dos veces.

In Communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer. In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in Communist society, the present dominates the past. In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.","And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying.But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also. This talk about free selling and buying, and all the other \u201cbrave words of our bourgeois about freedom in general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production, and of the bourgeoisie itself.\u201d","Hegel is not to be blamed for depicting the nature of the modern state as it is, but rather for presenting what is as the essence of the state. The claim that the rational is actual is contradicted precisely by an irrational actuality, which everywhere is the contrary of what it asserts and asserts the contrary of what it is.","When the narrow bourgeois form has been peeled away, what is wealth, if not the universality of needs, capacities, enjoyments, productive powers etc., of individuals, produced in universal exchange? What, if not the full development of human control over the forces of nature \u2014 those of his own nature as well as those of so-called \u201cnature\\"? What, if not the absolute elaboration of his creative dispositions, without any preconditions other than antecedent historical evolution which make the totality of this evolution \u2014 i.e., the evolution of all human powers as such, unmeasured by any previously established yardstick \u2014 an end in itself? What is this, if not a situation where man does not reproduce in any determined form, but produces his totality? Where he does not seek to remain something formed by the past, but is in the absolute movement of becoming?","The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature.","Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation, distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away; all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind.","Nevertheless, for weal or for woe, there is no such thing extant as \\"Anglo-Saxon\\"\u2014of all nations, said to be \\"Anglo-Saxon,\\" in the United States least. What we still have from England, much as appearances may seem to point the other way, is not of our bone-and-marrow, so to speak, but rather partakes of the nature of \\"importations.\\" We are no more English on account of them than we are Chinese because we all drink tea.","The utility of a thing makes it a use value.[14] But this utility is not a thing of air. Being limited by the physical properties of the commodity, it has no existence apart from that commodity. A commodity, such as iron, corn, or a diamond, is therefore, so far as it is a material thing, a use value, something useful. This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities.","Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself.","Maddi ya\u015famdaki \xfcretim bi\xe7imi, ya\u015fam\u0131n toplumsal, siyasal ve d\xfc\u015f\xfcnsel s\xfcrecinin genel niteli\u011fine egemendir. \u0130nsanlar\u0131n varl\u0131klar\u0131n\u0131 belirleyen \u015fey, bilin\xe7leri de\u011fildir; tam tersine, onlar\u0131n bilin\xe7lerini, toplumsal varl\u0131klar\u0131 belirler.","The advance of capitalist production develops a working class which by education, tradition and habit looks upon the requirements of that mode of production as self-evident natural laws.","Ognuno secondo le sue capacit\xe0; a ognuno secondo i suoi bisogni!","The formula for the circuit of capital: M-C...P...C\'-M\', is the self-evident form of the circuit of capital only on the basis of already developed capitalist production, because it presupposes the availability of the class of wage-labourers in sufficient numbers throughout society.","In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to, theexploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonismbetween classes within the nation vanishes, the hos tility of one nation to another will come to anend","One basis for life and another basis for science is a priori a lie.","It has been objected, that upon the abolition of private property all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not work. The whole of this objection is but another expression of tautology, that there can no longer be any wage-labor when there is no longer any capital.All objections against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products, have, in the same way, been urged against the Communistic modes of producing and appropriating intellectual products. Just as, to the bourgeois the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture.That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a mere training to act as a machine.","Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies not in the immediate result but in the ever improved means of communication that are created in modern industry and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralize the numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to attain which the burghers of the middle ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries, the modern proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years.","Man makes his own history, but he does not make it out of the whole cloth; he does not make it out of conditions chosen by himself, but out of such as he finds close at hand.

The East Indian and Chinese markets, the colonization of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.","la tendencia general de la producci\xf3n capitalista no es a elevar el nivel medio de los salarios, sino, por el contrario, a hacerlo bajar, o sea, a empujar m\xe1s o menos el valor del trabajo a su l\xedmite m\xednimo.

The time during which the labourer works, is the time during which the capitalist consumes the labour-power he has purchased of him.","The medieval proverb nulle terre sans seigneur [There is no land without its lord. \u2014 Ed.] is thereby replaced by that other proverb, l\'argent n\'a pas de ma\xeetre [Money knows no master. \u2014 Ed.], wherein is expressed the complete domination of dead matter over man.","First to control the people, first control the media.Karl Marx\u201d","The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is, to change it","Political economy starts with the fact of private property; it does not explain it to us. It expresses in general, abstract formulas the material process through which private property actually passes, and these formulas it then takes for laws. It does not comprehend these laws \u2014 i.e., it does not demonstrate how they arise from the very nature of private property.","Those professions which are not so much involved in life itself as concerned with abstract truths are the most dangerous for the young man whose principles are not yet firm and whose convictions are not yet strong and unshakeable.","Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.","All commodities, as values, are realized human labours.","Volume 2 of Capital has indeed been not only a \u2018sealed book\u2019, but also a forgotten one. To a large extent, it remains so to this very day.","Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the process of dissolution going on within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of old society, assumes such a violent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole.Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie to-day, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of modern industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product.The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay, more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance they are revolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat; they thus defend not their present, but their future interests, they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.The \\"dangerous class,\\" the social scum, that passively rotting class thrown off by the lowest layers of old society, may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.In the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at large are already virtually swamped. The proletarian is without property; his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family relations; modern industrial labor, modern subjection to capital, the same in England as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him of every trace of national character. Law, morality, religion, are to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests.","Those professions which are not so much involved in life itself as concerned with abstract truths are the most dangerous for the young man whose principles are not yet firm and whose convictions are not yet strong and unshakeable. At the same time these professions may seem to be the most exalted if they have taken deep root in our hearts and if we are capable of sacrificing our lives and all endeavours for the ideas which prevail in them.","In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things. In all these movements they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the time.

WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!","What is certain is that I myself am not a Marxist","[E]verything which appears in the worker as an activity of alienation, of estrangement, appears in the non-worker as a state of alienation, of estrangement.","Undoubtedly,\\" it will be said, \\"religious, moral, philosophical and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development. But religion, morality, philosophy, political science, and law, constantly survived this change.\\"There are besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.","In Book I\u2026 we content ourselves with the assumption that if in the self-expansion process \xa3100 becomes \xa3110, the latter will find already in existence in the market the elements into which it will change once more.","Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacture no longer sufficed. Thereupon steam and machinery revolutionized industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry, the place of the industrial middle class, by industrial millionaires, the leaders of whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.Modern industry has established the world\'s market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. The market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation and railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class handed down from the middle ages.We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.","In interest-bearing capital, therefore, this automatic fetish is elaborated into its pure form, self-valorizing value, money breeding money, and in this form no longer bears any marks of its origin. The social relation is consummated in the relationship of a thing, money, to itself....Capital is now a thing, but the thing is capital. The money\'s body is now by love possessed.\\"Karl Marx, Capital, Vol. 3, p. 516-517, containing a literary reference at the end there to Goethe, Faust, Part I. The context is Marx\'s discussion of how the commodity fetish\'s obfuscation of the true relations of capitalist production (i.e. the exploitation of labor) reaches its epitome in the form of interest-bearing capital (i.e. finance capital).","Religion, family, state, law, morality, science, art, etc., are only particular modes of production, and fall under its general law. The positive transcendence of private property as the appropriation of human life, is therefore the positive transcendence of all estrangement \u2014 that is to say, the return of man from religion, family, state, etc., to his human, i.e., social, existence.","In every stock jobbing swindle every one knows that some time or other the crash must come, but every one hopes that it may fall on the head of his neighbour, after he himself has caught the shower of gold and placed it in safety. Apres moi le d\xe9luge! is the watchword of every capitalist and of every capitalist nation. Hence capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from society.","We have seen what significance, given socialism, the wealth of human needs acquires, and what significance, therefore, both a new mode of production and a new object of production obtain: a new manifestation of the forces of human nature and a new enrichment of human nature. Under private property their significance is reversed: every person speculates on creating a new need in another, so as to drive him to fresh sacrifice, to place him in a new dependence and to seduce him into a new mode of enjoyment and therefore economic ruin. Each tries to establish over the other an alien power, so as thereby to find satisfaction of his own selfish need. The increase in the quantity of objects is therefore accompanied by an extension of the realm of the alien powers to which man is subjected, and every new product represents a new potentiality of mutual swindling and mutual plundering. Man becomes ever poorer as man, his need for money becomes even greater if he wants to master the hostile power.","When the commodity owners are not capitalists, but rather independent direct producers, the time they spend on buying and selling is a deduction from their labour time, and they therefore always seek (in antiquity, as also in the Middle Ages: F.E.) to defer such operations to feast days.","Last words are for fools who haven\u2019t said enough","Thus political economy \u2014 despite its worldly and voluptuous appearance \u2014 is a true moral science, the most moral of all the sciences. Self-renunciation, the renunciation of life and of all human needs, is its principal thesis. The less you eat, drink and buy books; the less you go to the theater, the dance hall, the public house, the less you think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save \u2014 the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor rust will devour \u2014 your capital. The less you are, the less you express your own life, the more you have, i.e., the greater is your alienated life, the greater is the store of your estranged being. Everything which the political economist takes from you in life and in humanity, he replaces for you in money and in wealth; and all the things which you cannot do, your money can do. It can eat and drink, go to the dance hall and the theater; it can travel, it can appropriate art, learning, the treasures of the past, political power \u2014 all this it can appropriate for you \u2014 it can buy all this: it is true endowment. Yet being all this, it wants to do nothing but create itself, buy itself; for everything else is after all its servant, and when I have the master I have the servant and do not need his servant. All passions and all activity must therefore be submerged in avarice. The worker may only have enough for him to want to live, and may only want to live in order to have that.","Labour is, first of all, a process between man and nature, a process by whichman, through his own actions, mediates, regulates and controls the metabolism between himself and nature. He confronts the materials of nature asa force of nature. He sets in motion the natural forces which belong to hisown body, his arms, legs, head and hands, in order to appropriate the materials of nature in a form adapted to his own needs. Through this movementhe acts upon external nature and changes it, and in this way he simultaneously changes his own nature. . . . It [the labor process] is the universal condition for the metabolic interaction [Stoffwechsel] between man and nature, the everlasting nature-imposed condition of human existence.","You must make everything that is yours saleable, i.e., useful. If I ask the political economist: Do I obey economic laws if I extract money by offering my body for sale, by surrendering it to another\'s lust? (The factory workers in France call the prostitution of their wives and daughters the nth working hour, which is literally correct.) \u2014 Or am I not acting in keeping with political economy if I sell my friend to the Moroccans? (And the direct sale of men in the form of a trade in conscripts, etc., takes place in all civilized countries.) \u2014 Then the political economist replies to me: You do not transgress my laws; but see what Cousin Ethics and Cousin Religion have to say about it. My political economic ethics and religion have nothing to reproach you with, but \u2014 But whom am I now to believe, political economy or ethics? \u2014 The ethics of political economy is acquisition, work, thrift, sobriety \u2014 but political economy promises to satisfy my needs. \u2014 The political economy of ethics is the opulence of a good conscience, of virtue, etc.; but how can I live virtuously if I do not live? And how can I have a good conscience if I do not know anything? It stems from the very nature of estrangement that each sphere applies to me a different and opposite yardstick \u2014 ethics one and political economy another; for each is a specific estrangement of man and focuses attention on a particular field of estranged essential activity, and each stands in an estranged relation to the other.","In the struggle against that state of affairs, criticism is no passion of the head, it is the head of passion. It is not a lancet, it is a weapon. Its object is its enemy, which it wants not to refute but to exterminate. For the spirit of that state of affairs is refuted. In itself, it is no object worthy of thought, it is an existence which is as despicable as it is despised. Criticism does not need to make things clear to itself as regards this object, for it has already settled accounts with it. It no longer assumes the quality of an end-in-itself, but only of a means. Its essential pathos is indignation, its essential work is denunciation.","tambi\xe9n el proletariado, esa clase obrera moderna que s\xf3lo puede vivir encontrando trabajo y que s\xf3lo encuentra trabajo en la medida en que \xe9ste alimenta a incremento el capital.

The development of modern industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.","The direct, natural, and necessary relation of person to person is the relation of man to woman. The relation of man to woman is the most genuine relation of human being to human being.

Human emancipation will only be complete when the real, individual man has absorbed into himself the abstract citizen; when as an individual man, in his everyday life, in his work, and in his relationships, he has become a species-being; and when he has recognized and organized his own powers (forces propres) as social powers so that he no longer separates this social power from himself as political power.","y, en t\xe9rminos generales, advertir\xe9is, frente a un enorme aumento de valor no s\xf3lo de las mercanc\xedas, sino tambi\xe9n en general de las operaciones en dinero, una tendencia a la disminuci\xf3n progresiva de los medios de pago.","All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind.","Es la declaraci\xf3n en quiebra de la econom\xeda \u201cburguesa\\", expuesta ya de mano maestra, en su obra Apuntes de econom\xeda pol\xedtica seg\xfan Stuart Mill por el gran erudito y cr\xedtico ruso N. Chernichevski.","The purchase and sale of slaves is also in its form a purchase and sale of commodities. Without the existence of slaves, however, money cannot fulfil this function. If there is slavery, then money can be spent on the acquisition of slaves. But money in the hand of the buyer is in no way a sufficient condition for the existence of slavery.","The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments and systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national class-interest, one frontier and one customs-tariff. The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature\'s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground\u2014what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?","The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level.","It\u2019s possible that I shall make an ass of myself. But in that case one can always get out of it with a little dialectic. I have, of course, so worded my proposition as to be right either way.","Our bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other\'s wives.Bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common, and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalized community of women. For the rest it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.","A\u0161 bjaurus, bet a\u0161 galiu nupirkti gra\u017eiausi\u0105 moter\u012f.

Ambas","The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. \u2026 what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?","Its dramatis personae are not so much the worker and the industrialist, but rather the money-owner (and money-lender), the wholesale merchant, the trader and the entrepreneur or \u2018functioning capitalist\u2019.","The average price of wage-labor, is the minimum wage ...","que el r\xe9gimen econ\xf3mico de la producci\xf3n y la estructuraci\xf3n social que de \xe9l se deriva necesariamente en cada \xe9poca hist\xf3rica constituye la base sobre la cual se asienta la historia pol\xedtica e intelectual de esa \xe9poca, y que, por tanto, toda la historia de la sociedad -una vez disuelto el primitivo r\xe9gimen de comunidad del suelo- es una historia de luchas de clases, de luchas entre clases explotadoras y explotadas, dominantes y dominadas, a tono con las diferentes fases del proceso social, hasta llegar a la fase presente, en que la clase explotada y oprimida -el proletariado- no puede ya emanciparse de la clase que la explota y la oprime -de la burgues\xeda- sin emancipar para siempre a la sociedad entera de la opresi\xf3n, la explotaci\xf3n y las luchas de clases; esta idea cardinal fue fruto personal y exclusivo de Marx .","Conversely, from the standpoint of the circulation process, the distinction between fixed and circulating capital, it is just as immaterial in what proportion a given value of circulating capital is divided between material of labour and wages. From the one standpoint, the material of labour is ranked in the same category as the means of labour, as opposed to the capital value laid out on labour-power. From the other standpoint, the part of capital laid out on labour-power is ranked together with that laid out on material of labour, as opposed to the part of capital laid out on means of labour.","The charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint, are not deserving of serious examination.","In the so-called Christian State it is true that alienation counts, but not the individual. The only individual who counts, the king, is a being specially distinguished from other individuals, who is also religious and directly connected with heaven, with God. The relations which here prevail are still relations of faith. The religious spirit is therefore not yet really secularized.","The ruling ideas of each age have [n]ever been the ideas of its ruling class.","We can thus understand why bourgeois political economy held instinctively to Adam Smith\u2019s confusion of the categories \u2018fixed and circulating capital\u2019 with the categories \u2018constant and variable capital\u2019, and uncritically echoed it from one generation down to the next for a whole century. It no longer distinguished at all between the portion of capital laid out on wages and the portion of capital laid out on raw material, and only formally distinguished the former from constant capital in terms of whether it was circulated bit by bit or all at once through the product. The basis for understanding the real movement of capitalist production, and thus of capitalist exploitation, was thus submerged at one blow. All that was involved, on this view, was the reappearance of values advanced.","working day of this kind, which is formed by the succession of more or less numerous interrelated working days, I call a working period. If we speak of the working day, then we mean the length of time for which the worker must daily expend his labour-power, must work.

At such a moment of transition we feel compelled to view the past and the present with the eagle eye of thought in order to become conscious of our real position. [\u2026] At such moments, however, a person becomes lyrical, for every metamorphosis is partly a swan song, partly the overture to a great new poem, which endeavors to achieve a stable form in brilliant colors that still merge into one another. Nevertheless, we should like to erect a memorial to what we have once lived through in order that this experience may regain in our emotions the place it has lost in our actions.","Tarihte ne olduysa \xf6yle olmas\u0131 gerekti\u011fi, ba\u015fka t\xfcrl\xfc olamayaca\u011f\u0131 i\xe7in \xf6yle olmu\u015ftur","...

No debe olvidar que lucha contra los efectos, pero no contra las causas de estos efectos; que lo que hace es contener el movimiento descendente, pero no cambiar su direcci\xf3n; que aplica paliativos, pero no cura la enfermedad. No debe, por tanto, entregarse por entero a esta inevitable lucha guerrillera, continuamente provocada por los abusos incesantes del capital o por las fluctuaciones del mercado. Debe comprender que el sistema actual, aun con todas las miserias que vuelca sobre ella, engendra simult\xe1neamente las condiciones materiales y las formas sociales necesarias para la reconstrucci\xf3n econ\xf3mica de la sociedad.

It has been the first to show what man\'s activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of nations and crusades."]')}}]);
