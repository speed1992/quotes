Without that symmetry, sex becomes a routine rather than an indulgence.","It is always by way of pain one arrives at pleasure.","Let us give ourselves indiscriminately to everything our passions suggest, and we will always be happy...Conscience is not the voice of Nature but only the voice of prejudice.","In order to know virtue, we must first acquaint ourselves with vice.","Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when lubricated.","One must do violence to the object of one\'s desire; when it surrenders, the pleasure is greater.","We are no guiltier in following the primative impulses that govern us than is the Nile for her floods or the sea for her waves.","Is it not of the imagination that the sharpest pleasures arise?","If it is the dirty element that gives pleasure to the act of lust, then the dirtier it is, the more pleasurable it is bound to be.","Imperious, choleric, irascible, extreme in everything, with a dissolute imagination the like of which has never been seen, atheistic to the point of fanaticism, there you have me in a nutshell, and kill me again or take me as I am, for I shall not change.","You say that my way of thinking cannot be tolerated? What of it? The man who alters his way of thinking to suit othere is a fool. My way of thinking is the result of my reflections. It is part of my inner being,the way I am made. I do not contradict them, and would not even if I wished to. For my system, which you disapprove of is also my greatest comfort in life, the source of all my happiness -it means more to me than my life itself.","I\'ve been to Hell. You\'ve only read about it.","Your body is the church where Nature asks to be reverenced.","I\'ve already told you: the only way to a woman\'s heart is along the path of torment. I know none other as sure.","How delightful are the pleasures of the imagination! In those delectable moments, the whole world is ours; not a single creature resists us, we devastate the world, we repopulate it with new objects which, in turn, we immolate. The means to every crime is ours, and we employ them all, we multiply the horror a hundredfold.","My passions, concentrated on a single point, resemble the rays of a sun assembled by a magnifying glass: they immediately set fire to whatever object they find in their way.","Either kill me or take me as I am, because I\'ll be damned if I ever change.","Why do you complain of your fate when you could so easily change it?","Don\'t have children: they deform women\'s bodies and turn into an enemy 20 years later.","All universal moral principles are idle fancies.","Can we become other than what we are?","The man who alters his way of thinking to suit others is a fool.","Your service will be arduous, it will be painful and rigorous, and the slightest delinquencies will be requited immediately with corporal and afflicting punishments; hence, I must recommend to you prompt exactness, submissiveness, and total self-abnegation that you be enabled to heed naught but our desires; let them be your laws, fly to do their bidding, anticipate them, cause them to be born.","Lust\'s passion will be served; it demands, it militates, it tyrannizes.","Are your convictions so fragile that mine cannot stand in opposition to them? Is your God so illusory that the presence of my Devil reveals his insufficiency?","And if I were a naughty little boy, the idea is to spank me into good behavior?","The idea of God is the sole wrong for which I cannot forgive mankind.","The pleasure of the senses is always regulated in accordance with the imagination. Man can aspire to felicity only by serving all the whims of his imagination.","Sex without pain is like food without taste","My manner of thinking, so you say, cannot be approved. Do you suppose I care? A poor fool indeed is he who adopts a manner of thinking to suit other people! My manner of thinking stems straight from my considered reflections; it holds with my existence, with the way I am made. It is not in my power to alter it; and were it, I\'d not do so.","Crime is the soul of lust. What would pleasure be if it were not accompanied by crime? It is not the object of debauchery that excites us, rather the idea of evil.","Love Is Stronger Than Pride","I write what I see, the endless procession to the guillotine.

Ive been to hell, young man, youve only read about it.","Sex is as important as eating or drinking and we ought to allow the one appetite to be satisfied with as little restraint or false modesty as the other.","Cruelty, very far from being a vice, is the first sentiment Nature injects in us all. The infant breaks his toy, bites his nurse\'s breast, strangles his canary long before he is able to reason; cruelty is stamped in animals, in whom, as I think I have said, Nature\'s laws are more emphatically to be read than in ourselves; cruelty exists amongst savages, so much nearer to Nature than civilized men are; absurd then to maintain cruelty is a consequence of depravity. . . . Cruelty is simply the energy in a man civilization has not yet altogether corrupted: therefore it is a virtue, not a vice.","God strung up his own son like a side of veal. I shudder to think what he would do to me.","The debility to which Nature condemned women incontestably proves that her design is for man, who then more than ever enjoys his strength, to exercise it in all the violent forms that suit him best, by means of tortures, if he be so inclined, or worse.","There is no more lively sensation than that of pain; its impressions are certain and dependable, they never deceive as may those of the pleasure women perpetually feign and almost never experience.","My manner of thinking, so you say, cannot be approved. Do you suppose I care? A poor fool indeed is he who adopts a manner of thinking for others!","What we are doing here is only the image of what we would like to do.","How delicious to corrupt, to stifle all semblances of virtue and religion in that young heart!","To judge from the notions expounded by theologians, one must conclude that God created most men simply with a view to crowding hell.","Wolves which batten upon lambs, lambs consumed by wolves, the strong who immolate the weak, the weak victims of the strong: there you have Nature, there you have her intentions, there you have her scheme: a perpetual action and reaction, a host of vices, a host of virtues, in one word, a perfect equilibrium resulting from the equality of good and evil on earth.","Social order at the expense of liberty is hardly a bargain.","There are thorns everywhere, but along the path of vice, roses bloom above them.","Sexual pleasure is, I agree, a passion to which all others are subordinate but in which they all unite.","I think that if there were a God, there would be less evil on this earth. I believe that if evil exists here below, then either it was willed by God or it was beyond His powers to prevent it. Now I cannot bring myself to fear a God who is either spiteful or weak. I defy Him without fear and care not a fig for his thunderbolts.","The completest submissiveness is your lot, and that is all.","What does one want when one is engaged in the sexual act? That everything around you give you its utter attention, think only of you, care only for you...every man wants to be a tyrant when he fornicates.","It has, moreover, been proven that horror, nastiness, and the frightful are what give pleasure when one fornicates. Beauty is a simple thing; ugliness is the exceptional thing. And fiery imaginations, no doubt, always prefer the extraordinary thing to the simple thing.","In an age that is utterly corrupt, the best policy is to do as others do.","Religions are the cradles of despotism.","The primary and most beautiful of nature\'s qualities is motion","Behold, my love, behold all that I simultaneously do: scandal, seduction, bad example, incest, adultery, sodomy! Oh, Satan! one and unique God of my soul, inspire thou in me something yet more, present further perversions to my smoking heart, and then shalt thou see how I shall plunge myself into them all!","Never may an act of possession be exercised upon a free being; the exclusive possession of a woman is no less unjust than the possession of slaves; all men are born free, all have equal rights: never should we lose sight of those principles; according to which never may there be granted to one sex the legitimate right to lay monopolizing hands upon the other, and never may one of the sexes, or classes, arbitrarily possess the other.","So long as the laws remain such as they are today, employ some discretion: loud opinion forces us to do so; but in privacy and silence let us compensate ourselves for that cruel chastity we are obliged to display in public.","One is never so dangerous when one has no shame, than when one has grown too old to blush.","She had already allowed her delectable lover to pluck that flower which, so different from the rose to which it is nevertheless sometimes compared, has not the same faculty of being reborn each spring.","Happiness lies only in that which excites, and the only thing that excites is crime.","Nature has endowed each of us with a capacity for kindly feelings: let us not squander them on others.","If the objects who serve us feel ecstacy, they are much more often concerned with themselves than with us, and our own enjoyment is consequently impaired. The idea of seeing another person experience the same pleasure reduces one to a kind of equality which spoils the unutterable charms that come from despotism.","What is more immoral than war?","No kind of sensation is keener and more active than that of pain its impressions are unmistakable.","I want to be the victim of his errors.","Between understanding and faith immediate connections must subsist.","Beauty belongs to the sphere of the simple, the ordinary, whilst ugliness is something extraordinary, and there is no question but that every ardent imagination prefers in lubricity, the extraordinary to the commonplace","Get it into your head once and for all, my simple and very fainthearted fellow, that what fools call humanness is nothing but a weakness born of fear and egoism; that this chimerical virtue, enslaving only weak men, is unknown to those whose character is formed by stoicism, courage, and philosophy.","Do not breed. Nothing gives less pleasure than childbearing. Pregnancies are damaging to health, spoil the figure, wither the charms, and it\'s the cloud of uncertainty forever hanging over these events that darkens a husband\'s mood.","In libertinage, nothing is frightful, because everything libertinage suggests is also a natural inspiration; the most extraordinary, the most bizarre acts, those which most arrantly seem to conflict with every law, every human institution... even those that are not frightful, and there is not one amongst them all that cannot be demonstrated within the boundaries of nature.","Happiness lies neither in vice nor in virtue; but in the manner we appreciate the one and the other, and the choice we make pursuant to our individual organization.","Certain souls seem hard because they are capable of strong feelings, and they sometimes go to rather extreme lengths; their apparent unconcern and cruelty are but ways, known only to themselves, of feeling more strongly than others.","It is not my mode of thought that has caused my misfortunes, but the mode of thought of others.","Chimerical and empty being, your name alone has caused more blood to flow on the face of the earth than any political war ever will. Return to the nothingness from which the mad hope and ridiculous fright of men dared call you forth to their misfortune. You only appeared as a torment for the human race. What crimes would have been spared the world, if they had choked the first imbecile who thought of speaking of you.","The imagination is the spur of delights... all depends upon it, it is the mainspring of everything; now, is it not by means of the imagination one knows joy? Is it not of the imagination that the sharpest pleasures arise?","Virtue can procure only an imaginary happiness; true felicity lies only in the senses, and virtue gratifies none of them.","Lust is to the other passions what the nervous fluid is to life; it supports them all, lends strength to them all ambition, cruelty, avarice, revenge, are all founded on lust.","Any enjoyment is weakened when shared.","I assumed that everything must yield to me, that the entire universe had to flatter my whims, and that I had the right to satisfy them at will.","If Nature denies eternity to beings, it follows that their destruction is one of her laws. Now, once we observe that destruction is so useful to her that she absolutely cannot dispense with it from this moment onward the idea of annihilation which we attach to death ceases to be real what we call the end of the living animal is no longer a true finish, but a simple transformation, a transmutation of matter. According to these irrefutable principles, death is hence no more than a change of form, an imperceptible passage from one existence into another.","Evil is... a moral entity and not a created one, an eternal and not a perishable entity: it existed before the world; it constituted the monstrous, the execrable being who was also to fashion such a hideous world. It will hence exist after the creatures which people this world","Now I beg of you to tell me whether I must love a human being simply because he exists or resembles me and whether for those reasons alone I must suddenly prefer him to myself?","Miserable creatures, thrown for a moment on the surface of this little pile of mud, is it decreed that one half of the flock should be the persecutor of the other? Is it for you, mankind, to pronounce on what is good and what is evil?","Nature has not got two voices, you know, one of them condemning all day what the other commands.","Murder is a horror, but an often necessary horror, never criminal, which it is essential to tolerate in a republican State. Is it or is it not a crime? If it is not, why make laws for its punishment? And if it is, by what barbarous logic do you, to punish it, duplicate it by another crime?","Here am I: at one stroke incestuous, adulteress, sodomite, and all that in a girl who only lost her maidenhead today! What progress, my friends with what rapidity I advance along the thorny road of vice!","What I should like to find is a crime the effects of which would be perpetual, even when I myself do not act, so that there would not be a single moment of my life even when I were asleep, when I was not the cause of some chaos, a chaos of such proportions that it would provoke a general corruption or a distubance so formal that even after my death its effects would still be felt.","It requires only two things to win credit for a miracle: a mountebank and a number of silly women.","It is not the opinions or the vices of private individuals that are harmful to the State, but rather the behavior of public figures.","Dread not infanticide; the crime is imaginary: we are always mistress of what we carry in our womb, and we do no more harm in destroying this kind of matter than in evacuating another, by medicines, when we feel the need.","Were he supreme, were he mighty, were he just, were he good, this God you tell me about, would it be through enigmas and buffooneries he would wish to teach me to serve and know him?","The majority of pop stars are complete idiots in every respect.","Conspiracy! Intrigue! A rapidly thickening plot! Add some bestiality and a lecherous priest and I\'d say you have the beginnings of a beautiful novel.","Every principle is a judgment, every judgment the outcome of experience, and experience is only acquired by the exercise of the senses . . .","Anything beyond the limits and grasp of the human mind is either illusion or futility; and because your god having to be one or the other of the two, in the first instance I should be mad to believe in him, and in the second a fool.","There is no God, Nature sufficeth unto herself; in no wise hath she need of an author.","Variety, multiplicity are the two most powerful vehicles of lust.","Let not your zeal to share your principles entice you beyond your borders.","Sensual excess drives out pity in man.","At all times, in every century, every age, there has been such a connection between despotism and religion that it is infinitely apparent and demonstrated a thousand times over, that in destroying one, the other must be undermined, for the simple reason that the first will always put the law into the service of the second.","I have supported my deviations with reasons; I did not stop at mere doubt; I have vanquished, I have uprooted, I have destroyed everything in my heart that might have interfered with my pleasure.","There is a kind of pleasure which comes from sacrilege or the profanation of the objects offered us for worship.","The most fortunate of persons is he who has the most means to satisfy his vagaries.","Lycurgus, Numa, Moses, Jesus Christ, Mohammed, all these great rogues, all these great thought-tyrants, knew how to associate the divinities they fabricated with their own boundless ambition.","Any punishment that does not correct, that can merely rouse rebellion in whoever has to endure it, is a piece of gratuitous infamy which makes those who impose it more guilty in the eyes of humanity, good sense and reason, nay a hundred times more guilty than the victim on whom the punishment is inflicted.","Fear not lest precautions and protective contrivances diminish your pleasure: mystery only adds thereto.","Prejudice is the sole author of infamies: how many acts are so qualified by an opinion forged out of naught but prejudice!","Those laws, being forged for universal application, are in perpetual conflict with personal interest, just as personal interest is always in contradiction with the general interest. Good for society, our laws are very bad for the individuals whereof it is composed; for, if they one time protect the individual, they hinder, trouble, fetter him for three quarters of his life.","The reasoning man who scorns the prejudices of simpletons necessarily becomes the enemy of simpletons; he must expect as much, and laugh at the inevitable.","What do I see in the God of that infamous sect if not an inconsistent and barbarous being, today the creator of a world of destruction he repents of tomorrow; what do I see there but a frail being forever unable to bring man to heel and force him to bend a knee. This creature, although emanated from him, dominates him, knows how to offend him and thereby merit torments eternally! What a weak fellow, this God!","If God permits virtue to be persecuted on earth, it is not for us to question his intentions. It may be that his rewards are held over for another life, for is it not true as written in Holy Scripture that the Lord chastenenth only the righteous! And after all, is not virtue it\'s own reward?","It is only by enlarging the scope of one\u2019s tastes and one\u2019s fantasies, by sacrificing everything to pleasure, that the unfortunate individual called Man, thrown despite himself into this sad world, can succeed in gathering a few roses among life\u2019s thorns","Happiness is ideal, it is the work of the imagination.","Destruction, hence, like creation, is one of Nature\'s mandates.","The more defects a man may have, the older he is, the less lovable, the more resounding his success.","Thread of their days without pity, and in the midst of life, without ever concerning themselves with this fatal moment, living as though they were to exist for ever, they disappear into the obscure cloud of immortality, uncertain of the fate which lies in store for them.","One must feel sorry for those who have strange tastes, but never insult them. Their wrong is Nature\'s too; they are no more responsible for having come into the world with tendencies unlike ours than are we for being born bandy-legged or well-proportioned.","Are not laws dangerous which inhibit the passions? Compare the centuries of anarchy with those of the strongest legalism in any country you like and you will see that it is only when the laws are silent that the greatest actions appear.","The degradation which characterizes the state into which you plunge him by punishing him pleases, amuses, and delights him. Deep down he enjoys having gone so far as to deserve being treated in such a way.","Nothing we can do outrages Nature directly. Our acts of destruction give her new vigour and feed her energy, but none of our wreckings can weaken her power.","I am about to put foward some major ideas; they will be heard and pondered. If not all of them please, surely a few will; in some sort, then, I shall have contributed to the progress of our age, and shall be content.","Cruelty, very far from being a vice, is the first sentiment Nature injects in us all.","Consider the problem from the point of view of evil, evil being almost always pleasure\'s true and major charm; considered thus, the crime must appear greater when perpetrated upon a being of your identical sort than when inflicted upon one which is not, and this once established, the delight automatically doubles.","The horror of wedlock, the most appalling, the most loathsome of all the bonds humankind has devised for its own discomfort and degradation.","The mirror sees the man as beautiful, the mirror loves the man; another mirror sees the man as frightful and hates him; and it is always the same being who produces the impressions.","Truth titillates the imagination far less than fiction.","Are wars anything but the means whereby a nation is nourished, whereby it is strengthened, whereby it is buttressed?","Never lose sight of the fact that all human felicity lies in man\'s imagination, and that he cannot think to attain it unless he heeds all his caprices. The most fortunate of persons is he who has the most means to satisfy his vagaries.","The mechanism that directs government cannot be virtuous, because it is impossible to thwart every crime, to protect oneself from every criminal without being criminal too; that which directs corrupt mankind must be corrupt itself; and it will never be by means of virtue, virtue being inert and passive, that you will maintain control over vice, which is ever active: the governor must be more energetic than the governed.","It is certainly no crime to depict the bizarre ideas that nature inspires.","No lover, if he be of good faith, and sincere, will deny he would prefer to see his mistress dead than unfaithful.","What you call disorder is nothing else than one of the laws of the order you comprehend not and which you have erroneously named disorder because its effects, though good for Nature, run counter to your convenience or jar your opinions.","I don\'t know what the heart is, not I: I only use the word to denote the mind\'s frailties.","You are afraid of the people unrestrained-how ridiculous!","Nature, who for the perfect maintenance of the laws of her general equilibrium, has sometimes need of vices and sometimes of virtues, inspires now this impulse, now that one, in accordance with what she requires.","The impossibility of outraging nature is the greatest anguish man can know.","All, all is theft, all is unceasing and rigorous competition in nature; the desire to make off with the substance of others is the foremost - the most legitimate - passion nature has bred into us and, without doubt, the most agreeable one.","Certain souls may seem harsh to others, but it is just a way, beknownst only to them, of caring and feeling more deeply.","Man\'s natural character is to imitate; that of the sensitive man is to resemble as closely as possible the person whom he loves. It is only by imitating the vices of others that I have earned my misfortunes.","It is certain that stealing nourishes courage, strength, skill, tact, in a word, all the virtues useful to a republican system and consequently to our own. Lay partiality aside, and answer me: is theft, whose effect is to distribute wealth more evenly, to be branded as a wrong in our day, under our government which aims at equality? Plainly, the answer is no.","Humane sentiments are baseless, mad, and improper; they are incredibly feeble; never do they withstand the gainsaying passions, never do they resist bare necessity.","One weeps not save when one is afraid, and that is why kings are tyrants.","Happiness is an abstraction, it is a product of the imagination, it is a way of being moved, which depends entirely on our way of seeing and feeling.","The ultimate triumph of philosophy would be to cast light upon the mysterious ways in which Providence moves to achieve the designs it has for man.","Every principle is a judgment, every judgment the outcome of experience, and experience is only acquired by the exercise of the senses; whence it follows that religious principles bear upon nothing whatever and are not in the slightest innate. Ignorance and fear, you will repeat to them, ignorance and fear - those are the twin bases of every religion.","For mortal men there is but one hell, and that is the folly and wickedness and spite of his fellows; but once his life is over, there\'s an end to it: his annihilation is final and entire, of him nothing survives.","Crime is to the passions what nervous fluid is to life: it sustains them, it supplies their strength.","Is it not a strange blindness on our part to teach publicly the techniques of warfare and to reward with medals those who prove to be the most adroit killers?","Hope is the most sensitive part of a poor wretch\'s soul; whoever raises it only to torment him is behaving like the executioners in Hell who, they say, incessantly renew old wounds and concentrate their attention on that area of it that is already lacerated.","They declaim against the passions without bothering to think that it is from their flame philosophy lights its torch.","The primary and most beautiful of Nature\'s qualities is motion, which agitates her at all times, but this motion is simply a perpetual consequence of crimes, she conserves it by means of crimes only.","The law which attempts a man\'s life [capital punishment] is impractical, unjust, inadmissible. It has never repressed crime - for a second crime is every day committed at the foot of the scaffold.","\'Til the infallibility of human judgements shall have been proved to me, I shall demand the abolition of the penalty of death.","When she\'s abandoned her moral center and teachings...when she\'s cast aside her facade of propriety and lady-like demeanor...when I have so corrupted this fragile thing and brought out a writhing, mewling, bucking, wanton whore for my enjoyment and pleasure.....enticing from within this feral lioness...growling and scratching and biting...taking everything I dish out to her.....at that moment she is never more beautiful to me.","It is only by way of pain one arrives at pleasure","Fuck! Is one expected to be a gentleman when one is stiff?","Social order at the expense of liberty is hardly a bargain","The only way to a woman\'s heart is along the path of torment.","Sex\'\' is as important as eating or drinking and we ought to allow the one appetite to be satisfied with as little restraint or false modesty as the other","True happiness lies in the senses, and virtue gratifies none of them.","Let us give ourselves indiscriminately to everything our passions suggest, and we will always be happy\u2026Conscience is not the voice of Nature but only the voice of prejudice.","Before you were born, you were nothing more than an indistinguishable lump of unformed matter. After death, you simply will return to that nebulous state. You are going to become the raw material out of which new beings will be fashioned. Will there be pain in this natural process? No! Pleasure? No! Now, is there anything frightening in this? Certainly not! And yet, people sacrifice pleasure on earth in the hope that pain will be avoided in an after-life. The fools don\'t realize that, after death, pain and pleasure cannot exist: there is only the sensationless state of cosmic anonymity: therefore, the rule of life should be ... to enjoy oneself!","In order to know virtue, we must acquaint ourselves with vice. Only then can we know the true measure of a man.","Nothing quite encourages as does one\'s first unpunished crime.","...your service will be arduous, it will be painful and rigorous, and the slightest delinquencies will be requited immediately with corporal and afflicting punishments; hence, I must recommend to you prompt exactness, submissiveness, and total self-abnegation that you be enabled to heed naught but our desires; let them be your laws, fly to do their bidding, anticipate them, cause them to be born...","Oh, there are plenty of people,\\" the Duc used to observe, \\"who never misbehave save when passion spurs them to ill; later, the fire gone out of them, their now calm spirit peacefully returns to the path of virtue and, thus passing their life going from strife to error and from error to remorse, they end their days in such a way there is no telling just what roles they have enacted on earth. Such persons,\\" he would continue, \\"must surely be miserable: forever drifting, continually undecided, their entire life is spent detesting in the morning what they did the evening before. Certain to repent of the pleasures they taste, they take their delight in quaking, in such sort they become at once virtuous in crime and criminal in virtue.","The past encourages me, the present electrifies me, and I have little fear for the future; and my hope is that the rest of my life shall by far surpass the extravagances of my youth.","life is a bitch so enjoy it ;p","One has always had too much when one has had enough","The completest submissiveness is your lot, and that is all;","I am a libertine, but I am not a criminal nor a murderer, and since I am compelled to set my apology alongside my vindication, I shall therefore say that it might well be possible that those who condemn me as unjustly as I have been might themselves be unable to offset the infamies by good works as clearly established as those I can contrast to my errors. And yet you who today tyrannize me so cruelly, you do not believe it either: your vengeance has beguiled your mind, you have proceeded blindly to tyrannize, but your heart knows mine, it judges it more fairly, and it knows full well it is innocent.","this is what happens to the plans of humans, it is when they make them in the midst of their pleasures that death cuts the thread of their days without pity, and in the midst of life, without ever concerning themselves with this fatal moment, living as though they were to exist for ever, they disappear into the obscure cloud of immortality, uncertain of the fate which lies in store for them.","...Madame, I have become a whore through good-will and libertine through virtue.","Amigos mios, ha llegado la hora de darnos cuenta de que la moral deber\xeda ser la base de la religi\xf3n y no esta la base de la moral","Believe me, Eugenie, the words \\"vice\\" and \\"virtue\\" supply us only with local meanings. There is no action, however bizarre you may picture it, that is truly criminal; or one that can really be called virtuous. Everything depends on our customs and on the climates we live in. What is considered a crime here is often a virtue a few hundred leagues away; and the virtues of another hemisphere might, quite conversely, be regarded as crimes among us. There is no atrocity that hasn\'t been deified, no virtue that hasn\'t been stigmatized.","The law which attempts a man\'s life [capital punishment] is impractical, unjust, inadmissible. It has never repressed crime--for a second crime is every day committed at the foot of the scaffold.","When a man loves a woman, as our old troubadours used to say, even if he has heard or seen something that puts his beloved in a bad light, he should believe neither his ears nor his eyes, he should listen to his heart alone.","My vengeance needs blood.","Having proven that solitary pleasures are as delicious as any others and much more likely to delight, it becomes perfectly clear that this enjoyment, taken in independence of the objectwe employ, is not merely of a nature very remote from what could be pleasurable to thatobject, but is even found to be inimical to that object\u2019s pleasure: what is more, it may becomean imposed suffering, a vexation, or a torture, and the only thing that results from this abuse isa very certain increase of pleasure for the despot who does the tormenting or vexing; let usattempt to demonstrate this.Voluptuous emotion is nothing but a kind of vibration produced in our soul by shockswhich the imagination, inflamed by the remembrance of a lubricious object, registers uponour senses, either through this object\u2019s presence, or better still by this object\u2019s being exposedto that particular kind of irritation which most profoundly stirs us; thus, our voluptuoustransport \xc4 this indescribable convulsive needling which drives us wild, which lifts us to thehighest pitch of happiness at which man is able to arrive \xc4 is never ignited save by twocauses: either by the perception in the object we use of a real or imaginary beauty, the beautyin which we delight the most, or by the sight of that object undergoing the strongest possiblesensation; now, there is no more lively sensation than that of pain; its impressions are certainand dependable, they never deceive as may those of the pleasure women perpetually feign andalmost never experience; and, furthermore, how much self-confidence, youth, vigor, healthare not needed in order to be sure of producing this dubious and hardly very satisfyingimpression of pleasure in a woman. To produce the painful impression, on the contrary,requires no virtues at all: the more defects a man may have, the older he is, the less lovable,the more resounding his success. With what regards the objective, it will be far more certainlyattained since we are establishing the fact that one never better touches, I wish to say, that onenever better irritates one\u2019s senses than when the greatest possible impression has been produced in the employed object, by no matter what devices; therefore, he who will cause themost tumultuous impression to be born in a woman, he who will most thoroughly convulsethis woman\u2019s entire frame, very decidedly will have managed to procure himself the heaviest possible dose of voluptuousness, because the shock resultant upon us by the impressionsothers experience, which shock in turn is necessitated by the impression we have of thoseothers, will necessarily be more vigorous if the impression these others receive be painful,than if the impression they receive be sweet and mild; and it follows that the voluptuousegoist, who is persuaded his pleasures will be keen only insofar as they are entire, willtherefore impose, when he has it in his power to do so, the strongest possible dose of painupon the employed object, fully certain that what by way of voluptuous pleasure he extractswill be his only by dint of the very lively impression he has produced.\u201d","I wished to stifle the unhappy passion which burned in my soul; but is love an illness to be cured? All I endeavored to oppose to it merely fanned its flames.","It is only by sacrificing everything to sensual pleasure that this being known as Man, cast into the world in spite of himself, may succeed in sowing a few roses on the thorns of life.","It is only by imitating the vices of others that I have earned my misfortunes.","Oh! my friend, never seek to corrupt the person whom you love, it can go further than you think...","When we die, we die. No more. Once the spider-thread of life is severed, the human body is but a mass of corrupting vegetable matter. A feast for worms. That is all. Tell me, what is more ridiculous than the notion of an immortal soul; than the belief that when a man is dead, he remains alive, that when his life grinds to a halt, his soul -- or whatever you call it -- takes flight?","Those who are unhappyclutch at shadows, and togive themselves an enjoymentthat truth refuses them, theyartfully bring into being allsorts of illusions.","Imperious, angry, furious, extreme in all things, with a disturbance in the moral imagination unlike any the world has ever known - there you have me in a nutshell: and one more thing, kill me or take me as I am, for I will not change","Let us remember that, despite the tasteless fables in the Holy Writ -- Sodom and Gomorrah, for example -- Nature does not have two voices; She does not create the appetite for buggery, then proscribe its practice. This fallacious proscription is the work of those imbeciles who seem unable to view sex as anything but an instrumentality for the multiplication of their own imbecilic kind. But I put it to you thusly: would it not be unreasonable for Nature, if she opposed buggery, to reward its practitioners with consummate pleasure at the very moment when they, by buggering, heap insults upon Her \\"natural\\" order? Furthermore, if procreation were the primary purpose of sex, would woman be created capable of conceiving during only sixteen to eighteen hours of each month -- and thus, all arithmetic being performed, during only four to six years of her total life span? No, child, let us not ascribe to Nature those prohibitions which we acquire through fear or prejudice; all things which are possible are natural; let no one ever persuade you otherwise.","The ditch once covered over, above it acorns shall be strewn, in order that the spot become green again, and the copse grown back thick over it, the traces of my grave may disappear from the face of the earth as I trust the memory of me shall fade out of the minds of all men save nevertheless for those few who in their goodness have loved me until the last and of whom I carry away a sweet remembrance with me to the grave.\\"Last Will and Testament (1806)","...and above all, you should not think of writing as a way of earning your living. If you do, your work will smell of your poverty. It will be colored by your weakness and be as thin as your hunger. There are other trades which you can take up: make boots, not books.","The reasoning man who rejects the superstitions of simpletons necessarily becomes their enemy; he must expect as much and be prepared to laugh at the consequences.","The greatest pleasures are born of conquered repugnancies.","...for although we may fully respect our social conventions...it may unfortunately happen that , through the perversity of others we encounter only the thorns of life, whilst the wicked gather nothing but roses. will it not be said that virtue, however fair she may be, becomes the worst cause one can espouse... when she has grown so weak that she cannot struggle against vice?  - La Nouvelle Justine ou les Malheurs de la vertu, suivie de l\'histoire de Juliette\u201d","The imagination serves us only when the mind is absolutely free of any prejudice. A single prejudice suffices to cool off the imagination. This whimsical part of the mind is so unbridled as to be uncontrollable. Its greatest triumphs, its most eminent delights consist in smashing all the restraints that oppose it. Imagination is the enemy of all norms, the idolater of all disorder and of all that bears the color of crime.","There are no more than two or three crimes to commit in the world,\u2019 said Curval. \u2018Once those are done there is no more to be said \u2013 what remains is inferior and one no longer feels a thing. How many times, good God, have I not wished it were possible to attack the sun, to deprive the universe of it, or to use it to set the world ablaze \u2013 those would be crimes indeed, and not the little excesses in which we indulge, which do no more than metamorphose, in the course of a year, a dozen creatures into clods of earth.","Not my manner of thinking but the manner of thinking of others has been the source of my unhappiness.","It is only by sacrificing everything to the senses\u2019 pleasure that this individual, who never asked to be cast into this universe of woe, that this poor creature who goes under the name of Man, may be able to sow a smattering of roses atop the thorny path of life.","What, then, are religions if not the restraint wherewith the tyranny of the mightier sought to enslave the weaker? Motivated by that design, he dared say to him whom he claimed the right to dominate, that a God had forged the irons with which cruelty manacled him; and the latter, bestialized by his misery, indistinctly believed everything the former wished. Can religions, born of these rogueries, merit respect?","The state of a moral man, is one of tranquillity and peace; the state of an immoral man is one of perpetual unrest.","Now let us consider theft. From the standpoint of the wealthy, this is, of course, an horrendous crime. But, laying partiality aside, let us ask ourselves as republicans: shall we, upholding the principle that all men are equal, brand as wrong an act whose effect is to accomplish a more equal distribution of wealth? Theft furthers economic equilibrium: one never hears of the rich stealing from the poor, thereby aggravating the economic imbalance; only of the poor stealing from the rich, thereby correcting it. What possibly be wrong with that?","Self-interest lies behind all that men do, forming the important motive for all their actions; this rule has never deceived me","Nunca, repito, nunca pintar\xe9 el crimen bajo otros colores que los del infierno; quiero que se lo vea al desnudo, que se lo tema, que se lo deteste, y no conozco otra forma de lograrlo que mostrarlo con todo el horror que lo caracteriza.","To enlighten mankind and improve its morals is the only lesson which we offer in this story. In reading it, may the world discover how great is the peril which follows the footsteps of those who will stop at nothing to satisfy their desires.","A little less vice is virtuousness in a very vicious heart","One must feel sorry for those who have strange tastes, but never insult them. Their wrong is Nature\'s too; they are no more responsible for having come into the world with tendencies unlike ours than are we for being born bandy-legged for well-proportioned.","To lie is always a necessity for women; above all when they choose to deceive, falsehood becomes vital to them.","But the man who, by dint of long study and sober reflection, has succeeded in training his mind not to detect evil in anything, to consider all human actions with the utmost indifference, to regard them all as the inevitable consequences of a power - however it\'s defined - which is sometimes good and sometimes perverse but always irresistible, and gives rise to both what men approve and to what they condemn and never allows anything to distract or thwart its operations, such a man, I say, as you will agree, sir, may be as happy behaving as I behave as you are in the career which you follow. Happiness is an abstraction, a product of the imagination. It is one manner of being moved and depends exclusively on our way of seeing and feeling. Apart from the satisfaction of our needs, there is no single thing which makes all men happy. Every day we observe one man made happy by the circumstance which makes his neighbour supremely miserable. There is therefore nothing which guarantees happiness. It can only exist for us in the form given to it by our physical constitution and our philosophical principles. [...] Nothing in the world is real, nothing which merits praise or blame, nothing deserving reward or punishment, nothing which is unlawful here and perfectly legal five hundred leagues away, in other words, there is no unchanging, universal good.","Women are not made for one single man; \'tis for men at large Nature created them.","Never may an act of possession be exercised upon a free being; the exclusive possession of a woman is no less unjust than the possession of slaves; all men are born free, all have equal rights: never may there be granted to one sex the legitimate right to lay monopolizing hands on the other, and never may one of these sexes, or classes, arbitrarily posses the other.","The reasoning man who scorns the prejudices of simpletons necessarily becomes the enemy of simpletons; he must expect as much, and laugh at the inevitable. A traveler journeys along a fine road. It has been strewn with traps. He falls into one. Do you say it is the traveler\u2019s fault, or that of the scoundrel who lays the traps?","the slave preaches the virtues of kindness and humility to his master, because as a slave he has need of them;but the master, better guided by nature and his passions, has no need to devote himself to anything excepting those things which serve or please him. Be as kind as you wish, if you enjoy such things - but dont demand any reward for having had this pleasure","It has been estimated that more than 50 million individuals have lost their lives to wars and religious massacres. Is there even one among them worth the blood of a single bird?","I suggest somewhere that anyone who wishes to write and has no aptitude for it would be better off making shoes for ladies and boots for men.","This monster was outfitted with faculties so gigantic that even the broadest thoroughfares would still have appeared too narrow for him.","...those who deny or oppose these so pleasant delights (of virtue), do so only from jealousy, you may be sure, from the barbarous pleasure of making others as guilty and unhappy as they are. They are blind and would like everyone to be the same, they are mistaken, and would like everyone else to be mistaken; but if you could see into the depths of their hearts you would find only sorrow and repentance; all these apostles of crime are only evil and desperate people; you would not find a sincere person among them who would not admit, if he were truthful, that their poisonous words or dangerous writings had not been guided only by their passions. And what man in fact can say in cold blood that the bases of morality can be shaken without risk? What being would dare maintain that doing good and desiring good are not essentially the aim of mankind? And how can a man who will do only evil expect to be happy in a society whose strongest concern is the perpetual increase of good? But will not this apologist of crime not shudder himself when he had uprooted from all hearts the only thing which could lead to his conversion? What will stop his servants ruining him, if they have ceased to be virtuous?","Non, Th\xe9r\xe8se, non, il n\u2019est point de Dieu, la nature se suffit \xe0 elle-m\xeame ; elle n\u2019a nullement besoin d\u2019un auteur, cet auteur suppos\xe9 n\u2019est qu\u2019une d\xe9composition de ses propres forces","However, society is only composed of weak persons and strong; well, if the pact must perforce displease both weak and strong, there is great cause to suppose it will fail to suit society, and the previously existing state of warfare must appear infinitely preferable, since it permitted everyone the free exercise of his strength and his industry, whereof he would discover himself deprived by a society\'s unjust pact which takes too much from the one and never accords enough to the other; hence, the truly intelligent person is he who, indifferent to the risk of renewing the state of war that reigned prior to the contract, lashes out in irrevocable violation of that contract, violates it as much and often as he is able, full certain that what he will gain from these ruptures will always be more important than what he will lose if he happens to be a member of the weaker class; for such he was when he respected the treaty; by breaking it he may become one of the stronger; and if the laws return him to the class whence he wished to emerge, the worst that can befall him is the loss of his life, which is a misfortune infinitely less great than that of existing in opprobrium and wretchedness.There are then two positions available to us: either crime, which renders us happy, or the noose, which prevents us from being unhappy. I ask whether there can be any hesitation, lovely Therese, and where will your little mind find an argument able to combat that one?","From an early age I set myself above the monstrous fantasies of religion, being perfectly convinced that the existence of the creator is a revolting absurdity in which not even children believe any more; there is no need for me to restrain my tastes in order to please Him, it is from Nature that I received these tastes, and I should offend her by resisting them \u2013 if they are wicked, it is because they serve her purposes. In her hands I am nothing but a machine for her to operate as she wishes, and there is not a single one of my crimes that fails to serve her; the greater her need, the more she spurs me on \u2013 I should be a fool to resist her. Only the law stands in my way, but I defy it \u2013 my gold and my influence place me beyond the reach of those crude scales meant only for the common people.","It has pleased Nature so to make us that we attain happiness only by way of pain.","El amor es como el sol, no brilla menos para ti, solo por que brilla para los dem\xe1s","From the two things one: either my husband is a brutal, jealous one, or he\u2019s a refined man; in the first hypothesis, the best I can do is to revenge myself for his conduct; in the second, I would know not to burden myself; since I taste of pleasures, he\u2019ll be happy for it if he\u2019s honest: there\u2019s not a refined man who doesn\u2019t take pleasure at the spectacle of the happiness of the person he adores.","I would, thank God, watch the universe perish without shedding a tear.","Do the meager pleasures you have been able to enjoy during your fall compensate for the torments which now rend your heart? Happiness therefore lies only in virtue,my child, and all the sophistries of its detractors can never procure a single one of its delights.","He would doubtless have promised anything for the mere pleasure of breaking all bounds; perhaps he would even have liked her to ask him to swear on oath so he could add the attractions of perjury to his horrible pleasures.","Now we come to the crux of my philosophy: if the taking of pleasure is enhanced by the criminal character of the circumstances -- if, indeed, the pleasure taken is directly proportionate to the severity of the crime involved --, then is it not criminality itself which is pleasurable, and the seemingly pleasure-producing act nothing more than the instrument of its realization?","In completing your civilization, the causes changed, but you maintained the custom: no longer did you sacrifice victims to gods athirst for human blood, but to laws, which you deem sage because you found in them a specious reason to indulge your former habits, together with the semblance of a justice which was, at bottom, nothing other than the desire to preserve those horrid practices which you could not abjure.","I should like to find a crime with perpetual repercussions, which would continue even after I had ceased to act, so there would not be a single instant of my life, not even when I was asleep, when I would not be causing some sort of disorder, a disorder so extensive as to involve general corruption, or so absolute a disturbance that its effect would be prolonged even when my life had ceased.","My dear, the universe runs itself, and the eternal laws inherent in Nature suffice, without any first cause or prime mover, to produce all there is and all that we know; the perpetual movement of matter explains everything: why need we supply a motor to that which is ever in motion? The universe is an assemblage of unlike entities which act and react mutually and successively with and against each other; I discern no start, no finish, no fixed boundaries, this universe I see only as an incessant passing from one state into another, and within it only particular beings which forever change shape and form, but I acknowledge no universal cause behind and distinct from the universe and which gives it existence and which procures the modifications in the particular beings composing it.","One would have to lose one\'s wits to believe in a God, and to become a complete imbecile to adore Him.","First ourselves, then the others: this is Nature\'s order of progression. Consequently, we must show no respect, no quarter for others as soon as they have shown that our misfortune or our ruin is the object of their desires. To act differently, my daughter, would be show preference for others above ourselves, and that would be absurd.","There are,\' said Curval, \'but two or three crimes to perform in this world, and they, once done, there\'s no more to be said; all the rest is inferior, you cease any longer to feel. Ah, how many times, by God, have I not longed to be able to assail the sun, snatch it out of the universe, make a general darkness, or use that star to burn the world! oh, that would be a crime, oh yes, and not a little misdemeanor such as are all the ones we perform who are limited in a whole year\'s time to metamorphosing a dozen creatures into lumps of clay.","The laws vainly try to talk virtue to the mass, but it\'s just talk. The people who make the laws are really too biased towards evil and never carry out their fine talk -- they merely make a stab at it for the sake of appearances, that\'s all.","If, though full of respect for social conventions and never overstepping the bounds they draw round us, if, nonetheless, it should come to pass that the wicked tread upon flowers, will it not be decided that it is preferable to abandon oneself to the tide rather than to resist it? Will it not be felt that Virtue, however beautiful, becomes the worst of all attitudes when it is found too feeble to contend with Vice, and that, in an entirely corrupted age, the safest course is to follow along after the others?","\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064f\u062e\u0641 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u0639\u0627\u0642\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621\u0647 \u0643\u064a \u064a\u062a\u0645 \u0631\u062f\u0639\u0647 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0636 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u062c\u062f\u062f\u0627\u064b \u060c\u0648\u064e \u0643\u0628\u062d \u063a\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0632\u0647 \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0634\u0646\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0641\u064e\u0640 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0623\u0647\u062f\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0630\u064f \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0631\u062d\u0645 \u0623\u0645\u0647 \u060c\u0641\u064e\u0640 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u064a\u064f\u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u061f! \u0623\u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0636\u0639\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0644\u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u061f!\u060c\u0625\u0630\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0646 \u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u062a\u0629 \u0628\u0650 \u062d\u062c\u0651\u0629 \u062d\u0641\u0638 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0628\u064a\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0647\u062a\u0645 \u0628\u0647 !","There is no rational commensuration between what affects us and what affects others; the first we sense physically, the other only touches us morally.","Franval, who was now absolutely at ease, thought on,y of upsetting others; he behaved in his vindictive, unruly, impetuous way when he was disturbed; he desired his own tranquility again at any price, and in order to obtain it he clumsily adopted the only means most likely to make him lose it once again.

It is a manner of being moved which relies solely upon the way we see and feel. Except for the satisfaction of needs, there is nothing which makes all men equally happy.

Fortuitously placed, like them, upon this globe, he is born like them; like them, he reproduces, rises, and falls; like them he arrives at old age and sinks like them into nothingness at the close of the life span Nature assigns each species of animal, in accordance with its organic construction. Since the parallels are so exact that the inquiring eye of philosophy is absolutely unable to perceive any grounds for discrimination, there is then just as much evil in killing animals as men, or just as little, and whatever be the distinctions we make, they will be found to stem from our pride\'s prejudices, than which, unhappily, nothing is more absurd. If all individuals were possessed of eternal life, would it not become impossible for Nature to create any new ones? If Nature denies eternity to beings, it follows that their destruction is one of her laws. Now, once we observe that destruction is so useful to her that she absolutely cannot dispense with it, and that she cannot achieve her creations without drawing from the store of destruction which death prepares for her, from this moment onward the idea of annihilation which we attach to death ceases to be real; there is no more veritable annihilation; what we call the end of the living animal is no longer a true finis, but a simple transformation, a transmutation of matter, what every modern philosopher acknowledges as one of Nature\'s fundamental laws. According to these irrefutable principles, death is hence no more than a change of form, an imperceptible passage from one existence into another, and that is what Pythagoras called metempsychosis","Rather than fatigue your children\'s young organs with deific stupidities, replace them with excellent social principles; instead of teaching them futile prayers which, by the time they are sixteen, they will glory in having forgotten, let them be instructed in their duties toward society; train them to cherish the virtues you scarcely ever mentioned in former times and which, without your religious fables, are sufficient for their individual happiness; make them sense that this happiness consists in rendering others as fortunate as we desire to be ourselves.","Let a simple philosopher introduce these new pupils to the inscrutable but wonderful sublimities of Nature; let him prove to them that awareness of a god, often highly dangerous to men, never contributed to their happiness, and that they will not be happier for acknowledging as a cause of what they do not understand, something they well understand even less; that it is far less essential to inquire into the workings of Nature than to enjoy her and obey her laws; that these laws are as wise as they are simple; that they are written in the hearts of all men; and that it is but necessary to interrogate that heart to discern its impulse. If they wish absolutely that you speak to them of a creator, answer that things always having been what now they are, never having had a beginning and never going to have an end, it thus becomes as useless as impossible for man to be able to trace things back to an imaginary origin which would explain nothing and do not a jot of good. Tell them that men are incapable of obtaining true notions of a being who does not make his influence felt on one of our senses.","es preciso ser puta, ni\xf1a m\xeda, puta en el alma y en el coraz\xf3n.","Mme de Franval, indulgent and sweet-natured as ever, and always happy when anything brought her closer to a man who was dearer to her than her own life, went along with all the desires of that treacherous husband, anticipated them, served them, and shared them without exception, not daring to make the most of the moment, as she should have done, to persuade that barbarian to treat her better, and not plunge his unhappy wife every day into an abyss of pain and suffering.","\'Not all women have the failings that I must have had, given that I have not succeeded in tying you to me,\' she said, and added, with a sigh, \'or else not all husbands are like you.\'\xa0\xa0\xa0\'Wives...false, jealous, domineering, flirtatious, or devout...husbands, wicked, inconstant, cruel or despotic: that in a nutshell is how all individuals on earth are, Madame; do not expect to find any paragons of virtue.\'","Y ahora mi estimado lector, prep\xe1rate a leer la narraci\xf3n m\xe1s impura que se haya narrado jam\xe1s...","I maintain that what is taken for a naturally inspired horror of death is merely the fruit of the absurd fears which we, starting in childhood, develop regarding this total annihilation, fears initiated by the religious notions our elders stupidly cram into our young heads.

Is not such an idea, you will add when talking to them, quite as impossible as effects without causes? Is an idea without prototype anything other than an hallucination? Some scholars, you will continue, assure us that the idea of a god is innate, and that mortals already have this idea when in their mothers\' bellies. But, you will remark, that is false; every principle is a judgment, every judgment the outcome of experience, and experience is only acquired by the exercise of the senses; whence it follows that religious principles bear upon nothing whatever and are not in the slightest innate. How, you will go on, how have they been able to convince rational beings that the thing most difficult to understand is the most vital to them? It is that mankind has been terrorized; it is that when one is afraid one ceases to reason; it is, above all, that we have been advised to mistrust reason and defy it; and that, when the brain is disturbed, one believes anything and examines nothing. Ignorance and fear, you will repeat to them, ignorance and fear\u2014those are the twin bases of every religion. Man\'s uncertainty with respect to his god is, precisely, the cause for his attachment to his religion. Man\'s fear in dark places is as much physical as moral; fear becomes habitual in him, and is changed into need: he would believe he were lacking something even were he to have nothing more to hope for or dread.","...we mislead, but sweetly.","DOLMANCE \u2014 In this world there is nothing dangerous but pity and beneficence; goodness is never but a weakness of which the ingratitude and impertinence of the feeble always force honest folk to repent. Let a keen observer calculate all of pity\'s dangers, and let him compare them with those of a staunch, resolute severity, and he will see whether the former are not the greater. But we are straying, Eug\xe9nie; in the interests of your education, let\'s compress all that has just been said into this single word of advice: Never listen to your heart, my child; it is the most untrustworthy guide we have received from Nature; with greatest care close it up to misfortune\'s fallacious accents; far better for you to refuse a person whose wretchedness is genuine than to run the great risk of giving to a bandit, to an intriguer, or to a caballer: the one is of a very slight importance, the other may be of the highest disadvantage","Few men had been as cavalier and as debauched as the Pr\xe9sident, but completely jaded, utterly torpid, all he was left with now was the depravity and turpitude of libertinage.","N\xe3o h\xe1 homem que n\xe3o queira ser d\xe9spota quando est\xe1 com tes\xe3o.","Had it not been Nature\'s intent that man possess this feeling of superiority, she would not have created him stronger than the beings she destines to belong to him at those moments. The debility to which Nature condemned woman incontestably proves that her design is for man, who then more than ever enjoys his strength, to exercise it in all the violent forms that suit him best, by means of tortures, if he be so inclined, or worse. Would pleasure\'s climax be a kind of fury were it not the intention of this mother of humankind that behavior during copulation be the same as behavior in anger? What well-made man, in a word, what man endowed with vigorous organs does not desire, in one fashion or in another, to molest his partner during his enjoyment of her?","T\u03b1

What do I care for anything on this earth? Listen, my dear fellow, when this combustible heart of mine falls in love, there is no obstacle capable of preventing it from being satisfied. The more I fall in love, the more combustible it becomes. For me, having a woman is satisfying only by reason of the trouble I am put to on the way. Bedding a woman is the most prosaic thing in the world.","Remorse! Can a heart like mine ever know the meaning of such a feeling? The habit of evildoing expunged it long ago from my calloused soul.","de suprimir para siempre la atrocidad de la pena de muerte, porque la ley que atenta contra la vida de un hombre es impracticable, injusta e inadmisible.","And there you see what happens to the promises of eternal love which we women are foolish enough to believe! The more affectionate we are, the more likely it is that our seducers will desert us...the unfeeling brutes...the more we try to keep them, the greater the chance that they will abandon us.","The time has come, friendly reader, for you to prepare your heart and mind for the most impure tale ever written since the world began, for no such book may be found among either the ancients or the moderns.","How many times, good God, have I not wished it were possible to attack the sun, to deprive the universe of it, or to use it to set the world ablaze \u2013 those would be crimes indeed, and not the little excesses in which we indulge, which do no more than metamorphose, in the course of a year, a dozen creatures into clods of earth.","But, they assure us, the people stand in need of one; it amuses them, they are soothed by it. Fine! Then, if that be the case, give us a religion proper to free men; give us the gods of paganism. We shall willingly worship Jupiter, Hercules, Pallas; but we have no use for a dimensionless god who nevertheless fills everything with his immensity, an omnipotent god who never achieves what he wills, a supremely good being who creates malcontents only, a friend of order in whose government everything is in turmoil. No, we want no more of a god who is at loggerheads with Nature, who is the father of confusion, who moves man at the moment man abandons himself to horrors; such a god makes us quiver with indignation, and we consign him forever to the oblivion whence the infamous Robespierre wished to call him forth.","Those who have no principles are never more dangerous than when they reach the age when they lose all sense of shame. Their hearts are gangrened by depravity, they refine and polish up their first offences and convert them into heinous crimes while still believing they are still at the stage of minor misdemeanours.","Crime causes so much horror, even to them [criminals], that they would like, in order to escape from the necessity they feel to be bad, to be believed and always to be depicted as virtuous.","You have no idea, my friend, of the effect of a young woman\'s tears on all these weak and timid souls.","If they who are appointed to instruct and rule over men had wisdom and virtue themselves, realities, and not fantasies, would enable them to govern better; but scoundrels, quacksalvers, ambitious ruffians, or low sneaks, the lawgivers have ever found it easier to lull nations to sleep with bedtime tales than to teach truths to the public, than to develop intelligence in the population, than to encourage men to virtue by making it worthwhile for sound and palpable reasons, than, in short, to govern them in a logical manner.","\xc9 desprezando a opini\xe3o dos homens que voc\xea permanecer\xe1 na lembran\xe7a deles.","My soul is callous, it is impassive... I put any sentiment whatever at defiance to attain it, with the exception of pleasure. I am mistress of that soul\'s movements and affections, of its desires, of its impulsions; with me, everything is under the unchallenged control of mind; and there\'s worse yet... for my mind is appalling. But I am not complaining, I cherish my vices, I abhor virtue; I am the sworn enemy of all religions, of all gods and godlings, I fear neither the ills of life nor what follows death; and when you\'re like me, you\'re happy.","Il n\'y a que deux ou trois crimes \xe0 faire dans le monde, dit Curval, et, ceux-l\xe0 faits, tout est dit; le reste est inf\xe9rieur et l\'on ne sent plus rien.

The innocent creature! She did not know that vices, supported by birth and wealth, and then emboldened by impunity, only become more dangerous.","He who perpetrates an outrage may well be quick to forget what he has done. But they who have suffered at his hands are justified at least in remembering the wrongs he has done them.","We magistrates find that reason is the easiest thing in the world to dispense with; banished from our law courts as it is from our heads, we delight in trampling it underfoot, and that is what makes our judicial sentences such masterpieces, since (although commonsense never presides in them) those sentences are carried out with as much firmness as if people knew what they actually meant.","The President was in seventh heaven when he heard himself being teased like this; he strutted about and thrust his chest out; never did a man of the robe stick out his neck so far, not even one who has just hanged a man.","The more amorous the President became, the more his fatuousness made him intolerable: there is nothing in the world as comical as a lawyer in love\u2014he is the perfect picture of gaucheness, impertinence and ineptitude.","Time to yield, Valcour. Life henceforth offers you none but thorns. Unite your soul with those of your friends. Once more: read on, I say, and go to your grave.","No es el mal ocasionado al pr\xf3jimo de lo que nos arrepentimos, sino de la desgracia que nos ha producido cometerla y el ser descubierta.","The philosopher who travels the world in order to learn must put up with all customs, all religions, all kinds of weather and climate, all beds and all kinds of food, and leave to the voluptuous, indolent man in the capital his prejudices...his luxury...that obscene luxury that, as it never contains any real needs, creates artificial ones every day at the expense of fortune and health.","No passion has a greater need of the widest horizon of liberty than has this, none, doubtless, is as despotic; here it is that man likes to command, to be obeyed, to surround himself with slaves compelled to satisfy him; well, whenever you withhold from man the secret means whereby he exhales the dose of despotism Nature instilled in the depths of his heart, he will seek other outlets for it, it will be vented upon nearby objects; it will trouble the governmentIf you would avoid that danger, permit a free flight and rein to those tyrannical desires which, despite himself, torment man ceaselessly: content with having been able to exercise his small dominion in the middle of the harem of sultanas and youths whose submission your good offices and his money procure for him, he will go away appeased and with nothing but fond feelings for a government.","Oh! What an enigma is man!\\" exclaimed the Duke. \\"Yes, my friend,\\" said Curval. \\"That is why a certain very intelligent gentleman once said it was better to fuck him than to understand him.","Without principles and without virtue, and still full of the prejudices of that group of men whose pride had just led them to fight against the sovereign himself, Oxtiern imagined that nothing in the world could curb his passions. Well, of all those that burned within him, love was the most impetuous; but this feeling, which can be almost a virtue in a good soul, is bound to become the source of many crimes in a corrupt heart like that of Oxtiern.","Ser\xedan precisos otros pinceles distintos a los m\xedos para pintar la alegr\xeda de estos dos fieles amantes cuando volvieron a verse.

And how much self-esteem, youth, strength and vigour is required to produce in a woman that doubtful and hardly satisfying impression of pleasure. Whereas pain, by contrast, requires nothing: the more flaws a man has, the older and less likeable he is, the better he\'ll succeed.","He cuts off a young boy\'s four limbs, buggers the torso, feeds him well and so keeps him alive; as the limbs were not cut off too close to the torso, he lives for a long time \u2013 he buggers him thus for more than a year.","Lucile looked at me in astonishment and so I saw I had to explain a philosophy she was far from grasping. I did so \u2013 I made her understand how contemptible are the bonds that tie us to those who created us; I showed her that a mother, far from deserving our gratitude for having carried us in her womb, deserved only our hatred, since, for her own pleasure and at the risk of exposing us to all the misfortunes that might beset us in this world, she gave birth to us regardless, with the sole intention of satisfying her brutish lust.","\xa1Gran Dios!, as\xed es como han mancillado durante m\xe1s de doscientos a\xf1os tus altares; as\xed es como seres razonables han cre\xeddo deber honrarte; rociando tu templo con la sangre de tus criaturas, mancill\xe1ndolo con horrores e infamias, con ferocidades dignas de los can\xedbales es como varias generaciones de hombres sobre la tierra han cre\xeddo cumplir tus deseos y agradar a tu justicia.","Infeliz como eu era, poderia estar eu apaixonada pela vida, quando a maior felicidade que me podia acontecer era deix\xe1-la?","Everywhere I saw much vice and little virtue; everywhere I found the vanity, envy, avarice, and intemperance that enslaved the weak to the whims of the strong; everywhere I could divide man into two classes, to be pitied equally. In one, the rich man was a slave to his pleasures; in the other, the poor man a victim of fate\u2014yet I never perceived in one the urge to do better nor in the other the possibility of becoming better, as if both cultivated their common unhappiness and sought only to add shackles to shackles. The wealthiest among them invariably tightened his chains by doubling his desires while the poorest, insulted and mistrusted by the other, received not the slightest encouragement necessary to bear his burden.","All my sensations have been snuffed out. I no longer have any taste for anything; there is nothing I like. It was foolish to feel so much longing for the world. It now seems dismal and boring. Sometimes I feel inclined to become a Trappist monk, and it is possible that one fine day I will disappear without anyone\'s knowing what has become of me. I had never felt so misanthropic as I have since being amongst people again, and if to them I seem like a foreigner, they can be sure that they produce the same effect on me.","My dearest, we must stop seeing one another.\xa0\xa0\xa0There they are\u2014cruel words.

God knows I never transgressed. I saw my solicitude repaid by harshness, my attentions by brusqueness, my fidelity by crimes, my submission by horrors.","All our ideas are representations of objects that strike us: what is to represent to us the idea of a god, who is plainly an idea without object? Is 114not such an idea, you will add when talking to them, quite as impossible as effects without causes? Is an idea without prototype anything other than an hallucination? Some scholars, you will continue, assure us that the idea of a god is innate, and that mortals already have this idea when in their mothers\' bellies. But, you will remark, that is false; every principle is a judgment, every judgment the outcome of experience, and experience is only acquired by the exercise of the senses; whence it follows that religious principles bear upon nothing whatever and are not in the slightest innate. How, you will go on, how have they been able to convince rational beings that the thing most difficult to understand is the most vital to them? It is that mankind has been terrorized; it is that when one is afraid one ceases to reason; it is, above all, that we have been advised to mistrust reason and defy it; and that, when the brain is disturbed, one believes anything and examines nothing. Ignorance and fear, you will repeat to them, ignorance and fear\u2014those are the twin bases of every religion. Man\'s uncertainty with respect to his god is, precisely, the cause for his attachment to his religion. Man\'s fear in dark places is as much physical as moral; fear becomes habitual in him, and is changed into need: he would believe he were lacking something even were he to have nothing more to hope for or dread.","Slender and lissome, Zilia had skin of the purest white and features the very emblem of candor and modesty; her large dark blue eyes, more tender than lively, seemed to express love at the height of delicacy, sentiment at its most voluptuous. Her mouth was deliciously formed, her teeth white and beautiful; she seemed a little pale until one\'s gaze fell upon her and then she burst to life, fresh as a rose. Her brow was noble, her hair, so nicely patterned, ashen blonde in great quantity, elegantly matched by the gracious contours of her veil, streaming across alabaster breasts, always exposed in accord with the fashion of the country\u2014all finally lent this pretty woman the air of a goddess of youth. She had just reached her 16th year, still growing despite all, her arms lithe and fingers to our eyes so very supple and slender.","On the altar steps before my eyes was the most horrible scene. The King had just committed a human sacrifice; this palace was also his temple. His just-murdered victims were still palpitating at the feet of the idol. Lacerations covered the wretched victims and blood flowed everywhere, with heads separated from bodies\u2014all of it combined to chill my senses. I flinched from horror.","He was 45 years old, with a very fine physiognomy, rather pretty eyes, but a revolting mouth and revolting teeth, a pale, hairless body, a small but shapely arse, and a prick 5 inches around by 6 inches long.","For any citizen who does wrong you must have but one objective.

An hour ago our sailors were drunk and cursing. Now they raised their hands to implore Heaven\u2019s protection.

I\'d always believed misfortune nudges open the soul, that remembering the pains we ourselves endured, our heart grows more sensitive to the suffering of others. I was wrong.

Nothing inflames lust like this sensual little switch: one is pleased to find in a little boy that which makes him resemble a little girl, and a girl is much more alluring when, in order to please, she borrows from the sex one would prefer her to have.","Simone de Beauvoir has argued, perhaps counter-intuitively, that Sade deserves to be regarded as a moraliste for the ethical reflection he inspires in his readers: Sade drained to the dregs the moment of selfishness, injustice, misery, and he insisted upon its truth. The supreme value of his testimony lies in its ability to disturb us. It forces us to re-examine thoroughly the basic problem which haunts our age in different forms: the true relation between man and man.37","Num mundo inteiramente virtuoso, eu te aconselharia a virtude porque as recompensas a acompanhariam; a felicidade infalivelmente adviria dela; num mundo totalmente corrompido, jamais te aconselharia outra coisa sen\xe3o o v\xedcio.(...)ora, que felicidade esperam aqueles que contrariam eternamente o interesse dos outros?","Se te tivesses deixado levar pela corrente, terias encontrado o porto como eu.","Man\'s greatest fault is to buttress his vices with doctrines that, once elaborated, serve to legitimize his conduct; everything that would be condemned in the heart of another will be forever engraved in his own. That\'s why a young man\'s wrongdoings are insignificant: he betrays principles but returns to them. An older man sins only after reflection; his faults emanate from his philosophy, which foments and nourishes them by erecting principles on the debris of his childish morality. And in these inflexible so-called principles he discovers the laws of his depravity.","la v\xe9rit\xe9 d\xe9chira le voile qu\'\xe9tendait la main de l\'erreur sur le miroir de la vie, et je m\'y vis enfin tel que j\'\xe9tais.","By what right does this pack of leeches \u2013 which laps up the people\u2019s misfortunes,and which by its outrageous monopolies plunges this unfortunate class (whosesole crime is to be weak and poor) into the cruel necessity of losing either itshonour or its life, and in the case of the latter leaving it no other choice than tolose it through poverty or on the scaffold \u2013 what right, I ask you, do thesemonsters have to demand virtues?","Ya se ve: la envidia, la ambici\xf3n, he ah\xed las causas reales de disturbios de los que el inter\xe9s de Dios no fue m\xe1s que un pretexto. \xa1Oh, religi\xf3n!
