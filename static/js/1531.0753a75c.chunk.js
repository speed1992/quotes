It\u2019s a question precisely of destroying that notion of power.","One\'s life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation and compassion.","When women act like women, they are accused of being inferior. When women act like human beings, they are accused of behaving like men.","No one is more arrogant toward women, more aggressive or scornful, than the man who is anxious about his virility.","Change your life today. Don\'t gamble on the future, act now, without delay.","I am too intelligent, too demanding, and too resourceful for anyone to be able to take charge of me entirely. No one knows me or loves me completely. I have only myself","To be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future.","Whatever the country, capitalist or socialist, man was everywhere crushed by technology, made a stranger to his own work, imprisoned, forced into stupidity. The evil all arose from the fact that he had increased his needs rather than limited them; . . . As long as fresh needs continued to be created, so new frustrations would come into being. When had the decline begun? The day knowledge was preferred to wisdom and mere usefulness to beauty. . . . Only a moral revolution - not a social or political revolution - only a moral revolution would lead man back to his lost truth.","Be loved, be admired, be necessary; be somebody.","I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth - and truth rewarded me.","You have to start from where you are today and from what can be done.","As long as the family and the myth of the family ... have not been destroyed, women will still be oppressed.","One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine.","The body is not a thing, it is a situation: it is our grasp on the world and our sketch of our project","To give space when what one most yearns for is closeness, that is both the great test and great tragedy of love.","To emancipate woman is to refuse to confine her to the relations she bears to man, not to deny them to her; let her have her independent existence and she will continue nonetheless to exist for him also: mutually recognising each other as subject, each will yet remain for the other an other...when we abolish the slavery of half of humanity, together with the whole system of hypocrisy that it implies, then the \'division\' of humanity will reveal its genuine significance and the human couple will find its true form.","In a way, literature is true than life,\' he said to himself. \'On paper, you say exactly and completely what you feel. How easy it is to break things off on paper! You hate, you shout, you kill, you commit suicide; you carry things to the very end. And that\'s why it\'s false. But it\'s damned satisfying. In life, you\'re constantly denying yourself, and others are always contradicting you. On paper, I make time stand still and I impose my convictions on the whole world; they become the only reality.","No woman should be authorized to stay at home and raise her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one.","Sex pleasure in woman is a kind of magic spell; it demands complete abandon; if words or movements oppose the magic of caresses, the spell is broken.","From the very beginning, existentialism defined itself as a philosophy of ambiguity.","I am incapable of conceiving infinity, and yet I do not accept finity.","In itself, homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality: the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man; either, a human being, without feeling fear, restraint, or obligation.","I take on a shape and an existence only if I first throw myself into the world by loving, by doing.","it is true that nothing is gained without something being lost: everyone knows that in fulfilling oneself one necessarily sacrifices some possibilities.","All oppression creates a state of war.","Few tasks are more like the torture of Sisyphus than housework, with its endless repetition: the clean becomes soiled, the soiled is made clean, over and over, day after day. The housewife wears herself out marking time: she makes nothing, simply perpetuates the present \u2026 Eating, sleeping, cleaning \u2013 the years no longer rise up towards heaven, they lie spread out ahead, grey and identical. The battle against dust and dirt is never won.","The curse which lies upon marriage is that too often the individuals are joined in their weakness rather than in their strength -each asking from the other instead of finding pleasure in giving. It is even more deceptive to dream of gaining through the child a plenitude, a warmth, a value, which one is unable to create for oneself; the child brings joy only to the woman who is capable of disinterestedly desiring the happiness of another, to one who without being wrapped up in self seeks to transcend her own existence.","That\'s what I consider true generosity. You give your all, and yet you always feel as if it costs you nothing.","She was ready to deny the existence of space and time rather than admit that love might not be eternal.","The most mediocre of males feels himself a demigod as compared with women.","It must be said in addition that the men with the most scrupulous respect for embryonic life are also those who are most zealous when it comes to condemning adults to death in war.","Women have been burnt as witches simply because they were beautiful.","Marriage is a career which brings about more benefits than many others.","Society, being codified by man, decrees that woman is inferior; she can do away with this inferiority only by destroying the male\'s superiority.","It was easier for me to think of a world without a creator than of a creator loaded with all the contradictions of the world.","As soon as a woman re- fuses to be perfectly happy doing housework eight hours a day, society has a tendency to want to do a lobotomy on her.","I am awfully greedy; I want everything from life. I want to be a woman and to be a man, to have many friends and to have loneliness, to work much and write good books, to travel and enjoy myself, to be selfish and to be unselfish\u2026 You see, it is difficult to get all which I want. And then when I do not succeed I get mad with anger.","It\'s only arrogance if you\'re wrong.","Society turns away from the aged worker as though he belonged to another species. That is why the whole question is buried in a conspiracy of silence. Old age exposes the failure of our entire civilization.","Authentic love must be founded on reciprocal recognition of two freedoms. For each of them, love would be the revelation of the self through the gift of the self and the enrichment of the universe.","Words have to murder reality before they can hold it captive.","I wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom.","One can hardly tell women that washing up saucepans is their divine mission, [so] they are told that bringing up children is their divine mission. But the way things are in the world, bringing up children has a great deal in common with washing up saucepans.","To show your true ability is always, in a sense, to surpass the limits of your ability,  to go a little beyond them: to dare, to seek, to invent; it is at such  a moment that new talents are revealed, discovered, and realized","It is not in giving life but in risking life that man is raised above the animal; that is why superiority has been accorded in humanity not to the sex that brings forth but to that which kills.","Man is defined as a human being and a woman as a female - whenever she behaves as a human being she is said to imitate the male.","On the day when it will be possible for woman to love not in her weakness but in her strength, not to escape herself but to find herself, not to abase herself but to assert herself--on that day love will become for her, as for man, a source of life and not of mortal danger.","A man is in the right in being a man; it is the woman who is in the wrong.","When I was a child, when I was an adolescent, books saved me from despair: that convinced me that culture was the highest of values[...].","A freedom which is interested only in denying freedom must be denied. And it is not true that the recognition of the freedom of others limits my own freedom: to be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future; the existence of others as a freedom defines my situation and is even the condition of my own freedom. I am oppressed if I am thrown into prison, but not if I am kept from throwing my neighbor into prison.","To catch a husband is an art; to hold him is a job.","Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying.","To be oneself, simply oneself, is so amazing and utterly unique an experience that it\'s hard to convince oneself so singular a thing happens to everybody.","If you live long enough, you\'ll see that every victory turns into a defeat.","Youth and what the Italians so prettily call stamina. The vigor, the fire, that enables you to love and create. When you\'ve lost that, you\'ve lost everything.","I am incapable of conceiving infinity, and yet I do not accept finity. I want this adventure that is the context of my life to go on without end.","To abstain from politics is in itself a political attitude.","What an odd thing a diary is: the things you omit are more important than those you put in.","Oppression tries to defend itself by its utility.","A man attaches himself to woman -- not to enjoy her, but to enjoy himself.","To be a woman, if not a defect, is at least a peculiarity.","Society cares about the individual only in so far as he is profitable. The young know this. Their anxiety as they enter in upon social life matches the anguish of the old as they are excluded from it.","I think that where you go wrong is that you imagine that your reasons for living ought to fall on you, ready-made from heaven, whereas we have to find them for ourselves.","There is only one good. And that is to act according to the dictates of one\'s conscience.","It is in great part the anxiety of being a woman that devastates the feminine body.","The emancipation of women must be the work of women themselves, independent of the class struggle.","The nearer I come to the end of my days, the more I am enabled to see that strange thing, a life, and to see it whole.","Whatever the country, capitalist or socialist, man was everywhere crushed by technology, made a stranger to his own work, imprisoned, forced into stupidity.","Self-knowledge is no guarantee of happiness, but it is on the side of happiness and can supply the courage to fight for it.","I should like to be the landscape which I am contemplating, I should like this sky, this quiet water to think themselves within me, that it might be I whom they express in flesh and bone, and I remain at a distance. But it is also by this distance that the sky and the water exist before me. My contemplation is an excruciation only because it is also a joy. I can not appropriate the snow field where i slide. It remains foreign, forbidden, but I take delight in this very effort toward an impossible possession. I experience it as a triumph, not as a defeat.","However gifted an individual is at the outset, if his or her talents cannot be developed because of his or her social condition, because of the surrounding circumstances, these talents will be still-born.","Harmony between two individuals is never granted-it has to be conquered indefinitely.","I don\'t want to be just another blade of grass.","To be feminist doesn\'t mean simply to do nothing, to reduce yourself to total impotence under the pretext of refusing masculine values. There is a problematic, a very difficult dialectic between accepting power and refusing it, accepting certain masculine values, and wanting to transform them. I think it\'s worth a try.","Today, however, we are having a hard time living because we are so bent on outwitting death.","There is only one solution if old age is not to be an absurd parody of our former life, and that is to go on pursuing ends that give our existence a meaning.","Justice can never be done in the midst of injustice.","Why does one exist? That\'s not my problem. One does exist. The thing to do is to take no notice but go at it on the run and to keep on going right on until you die.","Between women love is contemplative; caresses are intended less to gain possession of the other than gradually to re-create the self through her; separateness is abolished, there is no struggle, no victory, no defeat; in exact reciprocity each is at once subject and object, sovereign and slave; duality become mutuality.","\u2026but all day long I would be training myself to think, to understand, to criticize, to know myself; I was seeking for the absolute truth: this preoccupation did not exactly encourage polite conversation.","At the moment of their emancipation, women have a need to write their own histories.","In every society the artist or writer remains an outsider.","Oppression tries to defend itself by its utility. But we have seen that it is one of the lies of the serious mind to attempt to give the word \\"useful\\" an absolute meaning; nothing is useful if it is not useful to man; nothing is useful to man if the latter is not in a position to define his own ends and values, if he is not free.","Old age is life\'s parody.","all success cloaks a surrender","The women of today are in a fair way to dethrone the myth of femininity; they are beginning to affirm their independence in concrete ways; but they do not easily succeed in living completely the life of a human being.","Tonight, once more, life sinks its teeth into my heart.","Love and action always imply a failure, but this failure must not keep us from loving and acting. For we have not only to establish what our situation is, we have to choose it in the very heart of its ambiguity.","Legislators, priests, philosophers, writers, ans scientists have striven to show that the subordinate position of woman is willed in heaven and advantageous on earth.","Regardless of the staggering dimensions of the world about us, the density of our ignorance, the risks of catastrophes to come, and our individual weakness within the immense collectivity, the fact remains that we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite. And in fact, any man who has known real loves, real revolts, real desires, and real will knows quite well that he has no need of any outside guarantee to be sure of his goals; their certitude comes from his own drive.","Most feminists in France came to feminism after \'68 as a result of the hypocrisy they experienced in leftist movements. In these movements, where everyone believed there was going to be true equality, fraternity between men and women, and that together they were going to struggle against this rotten society, even there they noticed that the leftists, the militants, kept them \\"in their place.\\" Women made the coffee while the others did the talking; they were the ones who typed the letters.","Old age was growing inside me. It kept catching my eye from the depths of the mirror. I was paralyzed sometimes as I saw it making its way toward me so steadily when nothing inside me was ready for it.","The innumerable conflicts that set men and women against one another come from the fact that neither is prepared to assume all the consequences of this situation which the one has offered and the other accepted.","What is an adult? A child blown up by age.","There is something false in this search for a purely feminine writing style. Language, such as it is, is inherited from a masculine society, and it contains many male prejudices. We must rid language of all that. Still, a language is not something created artificially; the proletariat can\'t use a different language from the bourgeoisie, even if they use it differently, even if from time to time they invent something, technical words or even a kind of worker\'s slang, which can be very beautiful and very rich. Women can do that as well, enrich their language, clean it up.","Men create their own gods and thus have some slight understanding that they are self-fabricated. Women are much more susceptible, because they are completely oppressed by men; they take men at their word and believe in the gods that men have made up. The situation of women, their culture, makes them kneel more often before the gods that have been created by men than men themselves do, who know what they\'ve done. To this extent, women will be more fanatical, whether it is for fascism or for totalitarianism.","The writer of originality, unless dead, is always shocking, scandalous; novelty disturbs and repels.","One is not conceived a lady, one turns into one.","The characteristic feature of all ethics is to consider human life as a game that can be won or lost and to teach man the means of winning.","In 1949, I believed that social progress, the triumph of the proletariat, socialism would lead to the emancipation of women. But I saw that nothing came of it: first of all, that socialism was not achieved anywhere, and that in certain countries which called themselves socialist, the situation of women was no better than it was in so-called capitalist countries.","Let women be provided with living strength of their own.","Existentialism does not offer to the reader the consolations of an abstract evasion: existentialism proposes no evasion. On the contrary, its ethics is experienced in the truth of life, and it then appears as the only proposition of salvation which one can address to men.","Writing ... is a profession that can only be learned by writing.","Defending the truth is not something one does out of a sense of duty or to allay guilt complexes, but is a reward in itself.","Buying is a profound pleasure.","The ballot box is a most inadequate mechanism of change.","The curse which lies upon marriage is that too often the individuals are joined in their weakness rather than in their strength - each asking from the other instead of finding pleasure in giving.","I had never believed in the sacred nature of literature. God had died when I was fourteen.","Woman is shut up in a kitchen or in a boudoir, and astonishment is expressed that her horizon is limited. Her wings are clipped, and it is found deplorable that she cannot fly.","When we abolish the slavery of half of humanity, together with the whole system of hypocrisy it implies, then the \\"division\\" of humanity will reveal its genuine significance and the human couple will find its true form.","Literature is born when something in life goes slightly adrift.","Self-consciousness is not knowledge but a story one tells about oneself.","Every time I start on a new book, I am a beginner again. I doubt myself, I grow discouraged, all the work accomplished in the past is as though it never was, my first drafts are so shapeless that it seems impossible to go on with the attempt at all, right up until the moment - always imperceptible, there, too, there is a break - when it is has become impossible not to finish it.","...counselling man to treat her as a slave while persuading her that she is a queen.","Therefore the misfortune which comes to man as a result of the fact that he was a child is that his freedom was first concealed from him and that all his life he will be nostalgic for the time when he did not know it\'s exigencies.","I could see no reason for being sad. It\xb4s just that it makes me unhappy not to feel happy.","Many things would be changed for Americans if they would only admit that there is ill-luck in this world and that misfortune is not a priori a crime.","No existence can be validly fulfilled if it is limited to itself.","Christian ideology has contributed no little to the oppression of woman.","Live with no time-out.","You have never had any confidence in him. And if he has no confidence in himself it is because he sees himself through your eyes.","It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our lives that we must draw our strength to live and our reasons for living.","She would never change, but one day at the touch of a fingertip she would fall to dust.","The individual is defined only by his relationship to the world and to other individuals; he exists only by transcending himself, and his freedom can be achieved only through the freedom of others. He justifies his existence by a movement which, like freedom, springs from his heart but which leads outside of himself.","I\'m not against mothers. I am against the ideology which expects every woman to have children, and I\'m against the circumstances under which mothers have to have their children.","Obviously, everything has always been defined by the dominant ideology. But the dominant ideology has been able to accept women\'s literature as well as men\'s literature. I would say that women have been hindered from creating for a variety of reasons, as Virginia Woolf so admirably explained in A Room of One\'s Own. When they have created, on the whole they have been recognized. In literature it hasn\'t been nearly as oppressive as in, say, painting, where even the existence of so many women painters has always been denied.","The word love has by no means the same sense for both sexes, and this is one cause of the serious misunderstandings that divide them.","I admire Freud a great deal as a person and thinker. Despite everything, I find his work very, very rich, but I think that for women he has been absolutely disastrous. And even more so, everyone who came after him.","Can one say that there is a way of crying out, of speaking, which is properly feminine? Personally, I don\'t think so. In the end, I find this is another way of putting women in a kind of singularity, a ghetto, which is not what I want. I want them to be singular and universal at the same time.","Each of us is responsible for everything and to every human being.","There are topics which are common to men and women. I think that if a woman speaks of oppression, of misery, she will speak of it in exactly the same way as a man. But if she speaks of her own personal problems as a woman, she will obviously speak in another way.","Only a woman can write what it is to feel as a woman, to be a woman.","Patience is one of those feminine qualities which have their origin in our oppression but should be preserved after our liberation.","That is what chills your spine when you read an account of a suicide: not the frail corpse hanging from the window bars but what happened inside that heart immediately before.","If her functioning as a female is not enough to define woman, if we decline also to explain her through \\"the eternal feminine,\\" and if nevertheless we admit, provisionally, that women do exist, then we must face the question: what is a woman?","One is not born a genius, one becomes a genius; and the feminine situation has up to the present rendered this becoming practically impossible.","One can not start by saying that our earthly destiny has or has not importance, for it depends upon us to give it importance.","When Goya was 80 he drew an ancient man propped on two sticks, with a great mass of white hair and beard all over his face, and the inscription, \\"I am still learning.\\"","Each person has his or her own very particular history and after all, the unconscious is the most secret part of ourselves.","Hegel held that the two sexes were of necessity different, the one being active and the other passive, and of course the female would be the passive one.","In the face of an obstacle which is impossible to overcome, stubbornness is stupid.","The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdity challenges every ethics; but also the finished rationalization of the real would leave no room for ethics; it is because man\'s condition is ambiguous that he seeks, through failure and outrageousness, to save his existence.","The most sympathetic of men never fully comprehend woman\'s concrete situation.","All the opportunities you let slip by! The idea, the inspiration just doesn\xb4t come fast enough. Instead of being open, you\xb4re closed up tight. That\xb4s the worst sin of all - the sin of omission.","--There you are. The sight of the changing world is miraculous and heartbreaking, both at the same time. --But so it is for me too. The heartbreaking side of growing old is not in the things around one but in oneself.","Art is an attempt to integrate evil.","It is old age, rather than death, that is to be contrasted with life. Old age is life\'s parody, whereas death transforms life into a destiny: in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension. Death does away with time.","I would certainly like to see some young women take up psychoanalysis seriously and reconstruct it from an absolutely new viewpoint.","There is something in the New York air that makes sleep useless.","I cannot be angry at God, in whom I do not believe.","One day I\'ll be old, dead, forgotten. And at this very moment, while I\'m sitting here thinking these things, a man in a dingy hotel room is thinking, \\"I will always be here.\\"","This has always been a man\'s world, and none of the reasons that have been offered in explanation have seemed adequate.","As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it.","To be moral is to discover fundamentally ones own being.","Whether you think of it as heavenly or as earthly, if you love life immortality is no consolation for death.","It\'s not a very big step from contentment to complacency.","The fact that we are human beings is infinitely more important than all the peculiarities that distinguish human beings from one another.","Capabilities are clearly manifested only when they have been realized.","Why one man rather than another? It was odd. You find yourself involved with a fellow for life just because he was the one that you met when you were nineteen.","Let women be provided with living strength of their own. Let them have the means to attack the world and wrest from it their own subsistence, and their dependence will be abolished -- that of man also.","I discovered feminism around 1970-72-precisely the time when feminism began to exist in France. Before that, there was no feminism.","But women do not say \'We\', except at some congress of feminists or similar formal demonstration; men say \'women\', and women use the same word in referring to themselves.","It is perfectly natural for the future woman to feel indignant at the limitations posed upon her by her sex. The real question is not why she should reject them: the problem is rather to understand why she accepts them.","Eating, sleeping, cleaning - the years no longer rise up toward heaven, they lie spread out ahead, gray and identical. The battle against dust and dirt is never won. Washing, ironing, sweeping, ferreting out rolls of lint from under wardrobes - all this halting of decay is also the denial of life; for time simultaneously creates and destroys, and only its negative aspect concerns the housekeeper.","There is the problem of unpaid labor, such as housework, which represents millions and millions of unsalaried work hours and on which masculine society is firmly based. To put an end to this would be to send the present-day capitalist system flying in a single blow. Only we can\'t do it by ourselves; there have to be other kinds of attacks on the system. So a certain alliance with revolutionary systems is necessary, even masculine ones.","Since it is the Other within us who is old, it is natural that the revelation of our age should come to us from outside --from others. We do not accept it willingly.","I never thought of myself as being in the avant-garde. I said what I had to say, as I was able to say it.","I think that Freud understood absolutely nothing about women - as he himself said.","There is a kind of universality in the human condition, masculine or feminine. That\'s one thing I continue to believe.","It\'s important that you think of your relationship with the world and the way you can express that world and that you not be stopped if it scandalizes or embarrasses; but you must not look for scandal or for the avant-garde as a thing in itself.","If women really did have complete equality with men, society would be completely overturned.","Society cares for the individual only so far as he is profitable.","Literature is always what the dominant ideology recognizes as literature.","One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.","A life is such a strange object, at one moment translucent, at another utterly opaque, an object I make with my own hands, an object imposed on me, an object for which the world provides the raw material and then steals it from me again, pulverized by events, scattered, broken, scored yet retaining its unity; how heavy it is and how inconsistent: this contradiction breeds many misunderstandings.","I was made for another planet altogether. I mistook the way.","The younger and healthier a woman is and the more her new and glossy body seems destined for eternal freshness, the less useful is artifice; but the carnal weakness of this prey that man takes and its ominous deterioration always have to be hidden from him...In any case, the more traits and proportions of a woman seem contrived, the more she delighted the heart of man because she seemed to escape the metamorphosis of natural things. The result is this strange paradox that by desiring to grasp nature, but transfigured, in woman, man destines her to artifice.","There are so many problems. Women can go to work on these as well without giving up their feminism.","Fathers never have exactly the daughters they want because they invent a notion a them that the daughters have to conform to.","Given masculine norms, it is clear that women are more likely to be considered crazy - I\'m not saying to be crazy.","Man is a talking animal and he will always let himself be swayed by the power of the word. Machines won\'t change human nature.","If I were proud of anything in my life, it would be of our love. I feel we have to tell to each other as many things as we can, so we are not only lovers, but the closest of friends at the same time.","On ne na|\\"t pas femme: on le devient. One is not born a woman: one becomes a woman.","I like everyone who tries to show that madness is, in large part, conditioned by society and particularly by the family, and therefore, strongly affects women.","immortality is a terrible curse.","This is certainly a very tricky point: How to ally yourself to other leftist forces without losing your feminist specificity.","What would Prince Charming have for occupation if he had not to awaken the Sleeping beauty?","The state of emotional intoxication allows one to grasp existence in one\'s self and in the other, as both subjectivity and passivity. The two partners merge in this ambiguous unity; each one is freed of his own presence and achieves immediate communication with the other.","Those interested in perpetuating present conditions are always in tears about the marvelous past that is about to disappear, without having so much as a smile for the young future.","She was trying to get rid of a religious hangover.","He reflected. \'I know a lot of different kids of people; what I want is to show each of them how the others really are. You hear so many lies!","I was struck by the absence, even among very young boys and girls, of any interior motivation; they were incapable of thinking, of inventing, of imagining, of choosing, of deciding for themselves; this incapacity was expressed by their conformism; in every domain of life they employed only the abstract measure of money, because they were unable to trust to their own judgment.","There\'s something tragic about you. Your feeling for the absolute. You were made to believe in God and spend your life in a convent.\' There are too many with that vocation. God would have had to love only me.","There is no justification for present existence other than its expansion into an indefinitely open future.","Existence must be asserted in the present if one does not want all life to be defined as an escape toward nothingness.","To will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision.","A foreign country can best be understood through its literature.","Ah, if only there were two of me, she thought, one who spoke and the other who listened, one who lived and one who watched, how I would love myself! I would envy no one.","My life was hurrying, racing tragically toward its end. And yet at the same time it was dripping so slowly, so very slowly now, hour by hour, minute by minute. One always has to wait until the sugar melts, the memory dies, the wound scars over, the sun sets, the unhappiness lifts and fades away.","I realized that even if we went on talking till Judgment Day, I would still find the time all too short.","The torment that so many young women know, bound hand and foot by love and motherhood, without having forgotten their former dreams.","To lose confidence in one\u2019s body is to lose confidence in oneself.","Few tasks are more like the torture of Sisyphus than housework, with its endless repetition: the clean becomes soiled, the soiled is made clean, over and over, day after day.","\u200eA day in which I don\'t write leaves a taste of ashes.","The way I approached a question, my habit of mind, the way I looked at things, what I took for granted - all this was myself and it did not seem to me that I could alter it.","I went to get a detective story. You have to kill time. But time will kill me too - and there\xb4s the true, preestablished balance.","Marriage is traditionally the destiny offered to women by society. Most women are married or have been, or plan to be or suffer from not being.","If the feminine issue is so absurd, is because the male\'s arrogance made it \\"a discussion","The past is not a peaceful landscape lying there behind me, a country in which I can stroll wherever I please, and will gradually show me all its secret hills and dales. As I was moving forward, so it was crumbling. Most of the wreckage that can be seen is colourless, distorted, frozen: its meaning escapes me... all that\'s left is a skeleton. I shall never find my plans again, my hopes and fears - I shall not find myself.","Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with the absolute truth.","On the evenings when my parents held parties, the drawing-room mirrors multiplied to infinity the scintillations of a crystal chandelier. Mama would take her seat at the grand piano to accompany a lady dressed in a cloud of tulle who played the violin and a cousin who performed on a cello. I would crack between my teeth the candied shell of an artificial fruit, and a burst of light would illuminate my palate with a taste of blackcurrant or pineapple: all the colours, all the lights were mine, the gauzy scarves, the diamonds, the laces; I held the whole party in my mouth.","People seem to think that if you keep your head empty you automatically fill your balls.","Literature takes its revenge on reality by making it the slave of fiction.","Every time a man dies, a child dies too, and an adolescent and a young man as well; everyone weeps for the one who was dear to him.","there is a poetry in making preserves; the housewife has caught duration in the snare of sugar, she has enclosed life in jars.","Sign of old age: distress at all leave-takings, all separations. And the sadness of memories, because I\'m aware they\'re condemned to death.","Work almost always has a double aspect: it is a bondage, a wearisome drudgery; but it is also a source of interest, a steadying element, a factor that helps to integrate the worker with society. Retirement may be looked upon either as a prolonged holiday or as a rejection, a being thrown on to the scrap-heap.","Jealousy is not contemptible, real love has a beak and claws.","She was not to look beyond herself for the meaning of her life.","Anger or revolt that does not get into the muscles remains a figment of the imagination.","If you are truly on the left, if you reject ideas of power and hierarchy, what you want is equality. Otherwise, it won\'t work at all.","Some things I loved have vanished. A great many others have been given to me","Two separate beings, in different circumstances, face to face in freedom and seeking justification of their existence through one another, will always live an adventure full of risk and promise.\\" (p. 248)","The American woman\'s inequality with men is proved by her defiant attitude.","Because we are separated everything separates us, even our efforts to join each other.","When an individual (or a group of individuals) is kept in a situation of inferiority, the fact is that he is inferior.","The earthly meaning of eternal life was death, and she refused to die.","The ideal of happiness has always taken material form in the house, whether cottage or castle; it stands for permanence and separation from the world.","The human species is forever in a state of change, forever becoming.","She offered her mouth to him, as if enchanted. A Persian princess, a little Indian, a fox, a morning glory, a lovely wisteria--it always pleased them when you told them they looked like something, like something else.","I\'ve always been keenly aware of the passing of time. I\'ve always thought that I was old. Even when I was twelve, I thought it was awful to be thirty. I felt that something was lost. At the same time, I was aware of what I could gain, and certain periods of my life have taught me a great deal. But, in spite of everything, I\'ve always been haunted by the passing of time and by the fact that death keeps closing in on us.","A couple who go on living together merely because that was how they began, without any other reason: was that what we were turning into?","My worst mistake has been not grasping that time goes by. It was going by and there I was, set in the attitude of the ideal wife of an ideal husband. Instead of bringing our sexual relationship to life again I brooded happily over memories of our former nights together.","Weakness\' is weakness only in light of the aims man sets for himself, the instruments at his disposal and the laws he imposes.","Writing is a trade ... which is learned by writing.","All the idols made by man, however terrifying they may be, are in point of fact subordinate to him, and that is why he will always have it in his power to destroy them.","The body is the instrument of our hold on the world.","Anyway I know only too well that all life is nothing but a brief reprieve from death.","The role of a retired person is no longer to possess one.","A Darwinian nation of economic fitness abhors idleness, dependence, non-productivity.","Living by proxy is always a precarious expedient.","Feminism is one way of attacking society as it now exists.","There is no such thing as a natural death: nothing that happens to a man is ever natural, since his presence calls the world into question. All men must die: but for every man his death is an accident and, even if he knows it and consents to it, an unjustifiable violation.","To create a language all of a piece which would be a women\'s language, that I find quite insane. There does not exist a mathematics which is only a women\'s mathematics, or a feminine science.","Woman has always been man\'s dependent, if not his slave; the two sexes have never shaped the world in equality. And even today woman is heavily handicapped, though her situation is beginning to change.","it is not the inferiority of women that has caused their historical insignificance; it is rather their historical insignificance that has doomed them to inferiority.","History is a great cemetery: men, deeds, ideas are always dying as soon as they are born.","It is impossible to do anything for anyone.","Buying is profound pleasure.","You can\'t assume the responsibility for everything you do or don\'t do.","it is so difficult not to become vain about one\'s own good luck.","Habit has a kind of poetry.","When someone you love dies you pay for the sin of outliving her with a thousand piercing regrets.","The writer can\'t stop her unconscious from showing up, that\'s certain.","The Sahara was a spectacle as alive as the sea. The tints of the dunes changed according to the time of day and the angle of the light: golden as apricots from far off, when we drove close to them they turned to freshly made butter; behind us they grew pink; from sand to rock, the materials of which the desert was made varied as much as its tints.","To will freedom and to will to disclose being are one and the same choice; hence, freedom takes a positive and constructive step which causes being to pass to existence in a movement which is constantly surpassed.","There are cases where the slave does not know his servitude and where it is necessary to bring the seed of his liberation to him from the outside: his submission is not enough to justify the tyranny which is imposed upon him.","If the unconscious must express itself it will do so through the work that you do consciously or subconsciously, with words, with what you have to say.","Sometimes speech is no more than a device for saying nothing - and a neater one than silence.","The renewed use of lobotomy today is particularly applicable to women: Because they do routine things, it is possible to take away their spirit of revolt, of debate, of criticism, and still leave them perfectly capable of making stews or washing dishes. It\'s terrible, this tendency to consider women something dangerous to society.","Science condemns itself to failure when, yielding to the infatuation of the serious, it aspires to attain being, to contain it, and to possess it; but it finds its truth if it considers itself as a free engagement of thought in the given, aiming, at each discovery, not at fusion with the thing, but at the possibility of new discoveries; what the mind then projects is the concrete accomplishment of its freedom.","Even if one is neither vain nor self-obsessed, it is so extraordinary to be oneself - exactly oneself and no one else - and so unique, that it seems natural that one should also be unique for someone else.","I willingly trust myself to chance. I let my thoughts wander, I digress, not only sitting at my work, but all day long, all night even. It often happens that a sentence suddenly runs through my head before I go to bed, or when I am unable to sleep, and I get up again and write it down.","We must not confuse the present with the past. With regard to the past, no further action is possible.","It\'s frightening to think that you mark your children merely by being yourself. It seems unfair. You can\'t assume the responsibility for everything you do --or don\'t do.","That a whole part of the middle class detests me... is utterly normal. I would be troubled if the contrary were true.","I think that feminism permits women to speak among themselves, instead of simply being resentful, having personal complaints, which get them nowhere and which make them sick and ill-tempered, depressive and poison the lives of their husbands and children. It\'s much better to arrive at a collective consciousness of this problem, which is both a kind of therapy and the basis for a struggle.","It\'s true that this is one of the problems which often arises among my radical, revolutionary feminist friends: Do you have to join the system or not? On the one hand, if you don\'t, you risk being ineffectual. But if you do, from that moment on, you place your feminism at the service of a system which you want to take apart.","La femme?sait que quand on la regarde on ne la distingue pas de son apparence: elle est juge  e, respecte  e, de  sire  e a\'   travers sa toilette. Woman?knows that when she is looked at she is not considered apart from her appearance: she is judged, respected, desired, by and through her toilette.","Si l\'on vit assez longtemps, on voit que toute victoire se change un jour en de  faite. If you live long enough, you\'ll find that every victory turns into a defeat.","There was a time, in the nineteenth century, for example, when women spoke mostly about the house, children, birth, and so forth, because it was their domain. That\'s changing a little, now.","The individuals who seem to us most outstanding, who are honored with the name of genius, are those who have proposed to enact the fate of all humanity in their personal existences.","There is not a single line in this diary that does not call for a correction or a denial...Yes: throughout these pages I meant what I was writing and I meant the opposite; reading them again I feel completely lost...I was lying to myself. How I lied to myself!","Every war, every revolution, demands the sacrifice of a generation, of a collectivity, by those who undertake it.","Fran\xe7oise could not help taking a surreptitious glance at Xavi\xe8re: she gave a start of amazement.  Xavi\xe8re was no longer watching, her head was lowered.  Fran\xe7oise barely suppressed a scream.  The girl was pressing the lighted end against her skin, a bitter smile curling her lips.  It was an intimate, solitary smile, like that of a half-wit; the voluptuous, tortured smile of a woman possessed of some secret pleasure.","I consider it almost antifeminist to say that there is a feminine nature which expresses itself differently, that a woman speaks her body more than a man, because after all, men also speak their bodies when they write. Everything is implicated in the work of a writer.","Picasso never thought of himself as avant-garde. I just find it a bad way to think of yourself.","And without a doubt it is more comfortable to endure blind bondage than to work for one\'s liberation; the dead, too, are better suited to the earth than the living.","Anais Nin shows an occasional grace in writing, but her work is quite foreign to me, precisely because she wants so much to be feminine and not feminist. And then she is so gaga before so many men. She talks about men I know in France, men who were less than nothing, and she considers them kings, extraordinary people.","The day had been spent in the expectation of these hours, and now they were crumbling away, becoming, in their turn, another period of expectancy...It was a journey without end, leading to an indefinite future, eternally shifting just as she was reaching the present.","Ce n\'est gue\'  re que dans les asiles que les coquettes gardent avec ente\\"  tement une foi entie\'  re en des regards absents; normalement, elles re  clament des te  moins. Women fond of dress are hardly ever entirely satisfied not to be seen, except among the insane; usually they want witnesses.","We always come back to the same vicious circle - an extreme degree of material or intellectual poverty does away with the means of alleviating it.","Few books are more thrilling than certain confessions, but they must be honest, and the author must have something to confess.","The whole world was nothing but an exile with no hope of a return.","For years I thought my work still lay ahead, and now I find it is behind me: there was no moment when it took place.","They [Americans] want to believe that Good and Evil can be defined in precise categories, that Good is already, or will be easily achieved. ... if this optimism appears too superficial, they will try to create a kind of anti-God: the U.S.S.R. That is Evil, and it only needs to be annihilated to re-establish the reign of Good.","For me, the problem of time is linked up with that of death, with the thought that we inevitably draw closer and closer to it, with the horror of decay.","In order to be an artist, one must be deeply rooted in the society.","Retirement may be looked upon either as a prolonged holiday or as a rejection, a being thrown on to the scrap-heap.","I think that The Second Sex will seem an old, dated book, after a while. But nonetheless, a book which will have made its contribution. At least, I hope so.","Truthfully speaking, women are dangerous, even those who aren\'t feminists, because there has always been a women\'s revolt. Only it has usually translated itself into solitary, individualist, disagreeable manifestations - the whole history of the taming of the shrew, the woman-shrew. They weren\'t shrews without cause.","Women aren\'t more easily swayed by fascism than men, but I believe that their situation makes them in effect more slavish than men.","The knight departing for new adventures offends his lady, yet she has nothing but contempt for him if he remains at her feet.","He formed his sentences hesitantly and then threw them at me with such force that I felt as if I were receiving a present each time","Sometimes you can accept an important post, on condition that it really puts you in a position to help women. Unfortunately, women who have important posts very often adopt masculine standards-power, ambition, personal success - and cut themselves off from other women.","It is doubtless impossible to approach any human problems with a mind free from bias.","The Communists, following Hegel, speak of humanity and its future as of some monolithic individuality. I was attacking this illusion.","A writer is hoisted up onto a pedestal only to scrutinize him more closely and conclude that it was a mistake to put him up there in the first place.","To make oneself an object, to make oneself passive, is a very different thing from being a passive object.","There has to be a certain relationship between the life and the writing style, and that is really a problem.","I am not at all for a feminism which is entirely separatist, which would say, \\"this domain is purely for women.\\" I don\'t believe that at all.","The misfortune is that although everyone must come to [death], each experiences the adventure in solitude. We never left Maman during those last days... and yet we were profoundly separated from her.","You can\'t define the future. And in my opinion, you can\'t define the avant-garde.","I have never read a really good novel written by a man where women are portrayed as they truly are. They can be portrayed externally very well - Stendhal\'s Madame de Renal, for example - but only as seen from the outside.","It\'s so easy to be mistaken about the future. Sometimes there are avant-gardes which believe themselves to be the avant-garde and which later find themselves to be absolutely dated.","But I must admit I didn\xb4t like that idea; do the same thing as everyone else. Eating to live, living to eat - that had been the nightmare of my adolescence. If it meant going back to that, if would be just as well to turn on the gas at once. But I suppose everyone thinks of things like that: let\xb4s turn on the gas at once. And you don\xb4t turn it on.","I was very fond of Lagneau\u2019s phrase: \u201cI have no comfort but in my absolute despair.","Literature in France seems to be undergoing a crisis now, and nothing comes immediately to mind.","There are jobs that can be done equally well by men or by women and that finally you can\'t see a difference. But from the moment that you involve yourself fully in writing a novel, for example, or an essay, then you are involved as a woman, in the same way that you can\'t deny your nationality - you are French, you are a man, you are a woman... all this passes into the writing.","If you try consciously to be avant-garde, it\'s a little dangerous, like the present state of modern painting, where dealers try to be avant-garde, and under this pretext, painters take some old scraps and call it avant-garde.","If you are writing something in which you are really involved, you don\'t even need to think about it any longer. The situation itself demands your total commitment as an individual, just as in your political commitments.","A man of the right doesn\'t write in the same way as a man of the left, you can see that right away, or a woman of the right or a woman of the left.","Virginia Woolf thought a lot about her own sex when she wrote. In the best sense of the word, her writing is very feminine, and by that I mean that women are supposed to be very sensitive to all the sensations of nature, much more so than men, much more contemplative. It\'s this quality that marks her best works.","Woman is determined not by her hormones or by mysterious instincts, but by the manner in which her body and her relation to the world are modified through the action of others than herself.","Work would be terribly boring if one did not play the game all out, passionately.","There are moments when you have to write certain things and you don\'t have to think of your sex. If you are writing about the population of the thirteenth district in Paris, even if you are writing on the women in the thirteenth district, there\'s no need to consider your sex.","Women\'s mutual understanding comes from the fact that they identify themselves with each other; but for the same reason each is against the others.","It\'s true that what you find in New York is something other than America. Only small towns and small countries are self-satisfied; a real capital goes beyond its borders.","Choice springs from the totality of the person. Thus, to study, to analyze what a person is, does not eliminate the idea of freedom.","Christianity gave eroticism its savor of sin and legend when it endowed the human female with a soul.","Insects were scurrying about in the shade cast by the grass, and the lawn was a huge monotonous forest of thousands of little green blades, all equal, all alike, hiding the world from each other. Anguished, she thought, \\"I don\'t want to be just another blade of grass.\\"","I think there is a great tendency toward autobiography among women today. It is perhaps facile - and I say that even though I have written one myself.","What is very troubling is that people who have tried to write literature, even, for example, proletarian writers, seem to write within the norms of the dominant class.","In fact, people seem to be tired of fiction now. There are so many other ways of exploring humanity - by ethnology, psychoanalysis, and so on. It\'s a little boring to make up stories. So many people think that it\'s better to be very close to reality and to recount one\'s life as it is rather than to fictionalize, as they say, that is to transpose, and therefore to cheat.","The day knowledge was preferred to wisdom and mere usefulness to beauty. . . . Only a moral revolution -- not a social or a political revolution -- only a moral revolution would lead man back to his lost truth.","Tragedies are all right for a while: you are concerned, you are curious, you feel good. And then it gets repetitive, it doesn\'t advance, it grows dreadfully boring: it is so very boring, even for me.","The time that one gains cannot be accumulated in a storehouse; it is contradictory to want to save up existence, which, the fact is, exists only by being spent and there is a good case for showing that airplanes, machines, the telephone, and the radio do not make men of today happier than those of former times.","... to adapt one\'s outlook to another person\'s salvation is the surest and quickest way of losing him.","Cooking is revolution and creation.","It is not mere chance that makes families speak of a child who is \'extraordinary for his age\' and also of an old man who is \'extraordinary for his age\'; the extraordinariness lies in their behaving like human beings when they are either not yet or no longer men.","If you haven\'t been happy very young, you can still be happy later on, but it\'s much harder. You need more luck.","I would stand transfixed before the windows of the confectioners\' shops, fascinated by the luminous sparkle of candied fruits, the cloudy lustre of jellies, the kaleidoscope inflorescence of acidulated fruit drops - red, green, orange, violet: I coveted the colours themselves as much as the pleasure they promised me.","Old age is better for women than for men. First of all, they have less far to fall, since their lives are more mediocre than those of most men.","In truth we need to change the society itself, men as well as women, to change everything.","Feminism is a revolutionary movement which is different from the class struggle movement, the proletarian movement, but which is a movement which must be leftist. By that I mean at the extreme left, a movement working to overthrow the whole society.","To refuse everything, to say, even when there is something which really should be done, \\"Ah, that\'s no longer feminist,\\" is a pessimistic, even masochistic tendency in women, the result of having been habituated to inertia, to pessimism.","A man would never get the notion of writing a book on the peculiar situation of the human male.","To protest in the name of morality against \'excesses\' or \'abuses\' is an error which hints on active complicity. There are no \'abuses\' or \'excesses\' here, simpily an all-pervasive system.","it is only on posters and in advertisement pages that Americans have those chubby cheeks, expanding smiles, smooth looks, and faces flushed with well-being. In fact, almost all are at odds with themselves; drink offers a remedy for this inner malady of which boredom is the most usual sign: as drinking is accepted by society, it does not appear as a sign of their [Americans\'] inability to adapt themselves; it is rather the adapted form of inadaptability.","Americans are nature-lovers: but they only admit of nature proofed and corrected by man.","I think it\'s wrong to write in a totally esoteric language when you want to talk about things which interest a multitude of women.","It is a difficult matter for man to realize the extreme importance of social discriminations which seem outwardly insignificant but which produce in woman moral and intellectual effects so profound that they appear to spring from her original nature.","from one minute to the next the present is merely an honorary past. It must be filled unceasingly anew to dissemble the curse it carries within itself; that is why Americans like speed, alcohol, thriller films and any sensational news: the demand for new things, and ever newer things, is feverish since nowhere will they rest.","We belong to this earth. Now I can see the truth ... I love you on this earth of ours. Love me, do!","Retirement revives the sorrow of parting, the feeling of abandonment, solitude and uselessness that is caused by the loss of some beloved person.","Dwelling-place and food are useful for life but give it no significance: the immediate goals of the housekeeper are only means, not true ends.","The arrogance of some Christians would close heaven to them if, to their misfortune, it existed.","It is for man to establish the reign of liberty in the midst of the world of the given. To gain the supreme victory, it is necessary, for one thing, that by and through their natural differentiation men and women unequivocally affirm their brotherhood.","The father\'s life is surrounded by mysterious prestige: the hours he spends in the home, the room where he works, the objects around him, his occupations, his habits, have a sacred character. It is he who feeds the family, is the one in charge and the head. Usually he works outside the home, and it is through him that the household communicates with the rest of the world: he is the embodiment of this adventurous, immense, difficult, and marvelous world; he is transcendence, he is God.","At bottom, antipsychiatry is still psychiatry. And it doesn\'t really address itself to women\'s problems.","If the writer is a woman, feminist or not, it will give the language something that it would not have if it had been used by a man.","Indeed, there is nothing more arbitrary than intervening as a stranger in a destiny which is not ours.","We can reorient science - for example, a kind of medicine much more directed toward the enormous number of women\'s health problems which are neglected now. But the original givens of this science are the same for men and for women. Women simply have to steal the instrument; they don\'t have to break it, or try, a priori, to make of it something totally different. Steal it and use it for their own good.","I believe that we must use language. If it is used in a feminist perspective, with a feminist sensibility, language will find itself changed in a feminist manner. It will nonetheless be the language. You can\'t not use this universal instrument; you can\'t create an artificial language, in my opinion. But naturally, each writer must use it in his/her own way.","You can\'t address yourself to women by speaking a language which no average woman will understand. In my opinion, it\'s wrong.","One\'s life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others.","That\'s what I consider true generosity: You give your all, and yet you always feel as if it costs you nothing.","...her wings are cut and then she is blamed for not knowing how to fly.","When she does not find love, she may find poetry. Because she does not act, she observes, she feels, she records; a color, a smile awakens profound echoes within her; her destiny is outside her, scattered in cities already built, on the faces of men already marked by life, she makes contact, she relishes with passion and yet in a manner more detached, more free, than that of a young man. Being poorly integrated in the universe of humanity and hardly able to adapt herself therein, she, like the child, is able to see it objectively; instead of being interested solely in her grasp on things, she looks for their significance; she catches their special outlines, their unexpected metamorphoses. She rarely feels a bold creativeness, and usually she lacks the technique of self-expression; but in her conversation, her letters, her literary essays, her sketches, she manifests an original sensitivity. The young girl throws herself into things with ardor, because she is not yet deprived of her transcendence; and the fact that she accomplishes nothing, that she is nothing, will make her impulses only the more passionate. Empty and unlimited, she seeks from within her nothingness to attain All.","One\'s life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, and compassion","Man is defined as a human being and a woman as a female \u2014 whenever she behaves as a human being she is said to imitate the male.","All oppression creates a state of war. And this is no exception.","Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with absolute truth.","Sex pleasure in women is a kind of magic spell; it demands complete abandon; if words or movements oppose the magic of caresses, the spell is broken.","There was once a man who lost his shadow. I forget what happened to him, but it was dreadful. As for me, I\'ve lost my own image. I did not look at it often; but it was there, in the background, just as Maurice had drawn it for me. A straightforward, genuine, \\"authentic\\" woman, with out mean-mindedness, uncompromising, but at the same time understanding, indulgent, sensitive, deeply feeling, intensely aware of things and of people, passionately devoted to those she loved and creating happiness for them. A fine life, serene, full, \\"harmonious.\\" It is dark: I cannot see myself anymore. And what do the others see? Maybe something hideous.","No one would take me just as I was, no one loved me; I shall love myself enough, I thought, to make up for this abandonment by everyone. Formerly, I had been quite satisfied with myself, but I had taken very little trouble to increase my self-knowledge; from now on, I would stand outside myself, watch over and observe myself; in my diary I had long conversations with myself. I was entering a world whose newness stunned me. I learned to distinguish between distress and melancholy, lack of emotion and serenity; I learned to recognize the hesitations of the heart, and its ecstasies, the splendor of great renunciations, and the subterranean murmurings of hope. I entered into exalted trances, as on those evenings when I used to gaze upon the sky full of moving clouds behind the distant blue of the hills; I was both the landscape and its beholder: I existed only through myself, and for myself\u2026 My path was clearly marked: I had to perfect, enrich and express myself in a work of art that would help others to live.","On ne na\xeet pas femme: on le devient.","If they want to flirt or initiate a friendship, they should carefully avoid giving the impression they are taking the initiative; men do not like tomboys, nor bluestockings, nor thinking women; too much audacity, culture, intelligence, or character frightens them. In most novels, as George Eliot observes, it is the dumb, blond heroine who outshines the virile brunette; and in The Mill on the Floss, Maggie tries in vain to reverse the roles; in the end she dies and it is blond Lucy who marries Stephen. In The Last of the Mohicans, vapid Alice wins the hero\u2019s heart and not valiant Cora; in Little Women kindly Jo is only a childhood friend for Laurie; he vows his love to curly-haired and insipid Amy. To be feminine is to show oneself as weak, futile, passive, and docile. The girl is supposed not only to primp and dress herself up but also to repress her spontaneity and substitute for it the grace and charm she has been taught by her elder sisters. Any self-assertion will take away from her femininity and her seductiveness.","Art, literature, and philosophy are attempts to found the world anew on a human freedom: that of the creator; to foster such an aim, one must first unequivocally posit oneself as a freedom. The restrictions that education and custom impose on a woman limit her grasp of the universe...Indeed, for one to become a creator, it is not enough to be cultivated, that is, to make going to shows and meeting people part of one\'s life; culture must be apprehended through the free movement of a transcendence; the spirit with all its riches must project itself in an empty sky that is its to fill; but if a thousand fine bonds tie it to the earth, its surge is broken. The girl today can certainly go out alone, stroll in the Tuileries; but I have already said how hostile the street is: eyes everywhere, hands waiting: if she wanders absentmindedly, her thoughts elsewhere, if she lights a cigarette in a cafe, if she goes to the cinema alone, an unpleasant incident can quickly occur; she must inspire respect by the way she dresses and behaves: this concern rivets her to the ground and self. \\"Her wings are clipped.\\" At eighteen, T.E. Lawrence went on a grand tour through France by bicycle; a young girl would never be permitted to take on such an adventure...Yet such experiences have an inestimable impact: this is how an individual in the headiness of freedom and discovery learns to look at the entire world as his fief...[The girl] may feel alone within the world: she never stands up in front of it, unique and sovereign.","It is so tiring to hate someone you love.","I love you, with a touch of tragedy and quite madly.","The books I liked became a Bible from which I drew advice and support; I copied out long passages from them; I memorized new canticles and new litanies, psalms, proverbs, and prophecies, and I sanctified every incident in my life by the recital of these sacred texts. My emotions, my tears, and my hopes were no less sincere on account of that; the words and the cadences, the lines and the verses were not aids to make believe: but they rescued from silent oblivion all those intimate adventures of the spirit that I couldn\u2019t speak to anyone about; they created a kind of communion between myself and those twin souls which existed somewhere out of reach; instead of living out my small private existence, I was participating in a great spiritual epic.","The curse which lies upon marriage is that too often the individuals are joined in their weakness rather than in their strength, each asking from the other instead of finding pleasure in giving. It is even more deceptive to dream of gaining through the child a plenitude, a warmth, a value, which one is unable to create for oneself; the child brings joy only to the woman who is capable of disinterestedly desiring the happiness of another, to one who without being wrapped up in self seeks to transcend her own existence.","Woman is shut up in a kitchen or in a boudoir, and astonishment is expressed that her horizon is limited. Her wings are clipped, and it is found deplorable that she cannot fly. Let but the future be opened to her, and she will no longer be compelled to linger in the present.","In fact, the sickness I was suffering from was that I had been driven out of the paradise of childhood and had not found my place in the world of adults. I had set myself up in the absolute in order to gaze down upon this world which was rejecting me; now, if I wanted to act, to write a book, to express myself, I would have to go back down there: but my contempt had annihilated it, and I could see nothing but emptiness. The fact is that I had not yet put my hand to the plow. Love, action, literary work: all I did was to roll these ideas round in my head; I was fighting in an abstract fashion against abstract possibilities, and I had come to the conclusion that reality was of the most pitiful insignificance.

The duality between Self and Other can be found in the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies; the division did not always fall into the category of the division of the sexes (...) No group ever defines itself as One without immediately setting up the Other opposite itself. It only takes three travelers brought together by chance in the same train compartment for the rest of the travellers to become vaguely hostile \'others\'. Village people view anyone not belonging to the village as suspicious \'others\'. For the native of a country, inhabitants of other countries are viewed as \'foreigners\'; Jews are the \'others\' for anti-Semites, blacks for racist Americans, indigenous people for colonists, proletarians for the propertied classes.","In particular those who are condemned to stagnation are often pronounced happy on the pretext that happiness consists in being at rest. This notion we reject, for our perspective is that of existentialist ethics. Every subject plays his part as such specifically through exploits or projects that serve as a mode of transcendence; he achieves liberty only through a continual reaching out towards other liberties. There is no justification for present existence other than its expansion into an indefinitely open future. Every time transcendence falls back into immanence, stagnation, there is a degradation of existence into the \u2018en-sois\u2019 \u2013 the brutish life of subjection to given conditions \u2013 and of liberty into constraint and contingence. This downfall represents a moral fault if the subject consents to it; if it is inflicted upon him, it spells frustration and oppression. In both cases it is an absolute evil. Every individual concerned to justify his existence feels that his existence involves an undefined need to transcend himself, to engage in freely chosen projects.","Alone: for the first time I understood the terrible significance of that word. Alone without a witness, without anyone to speak to, without refuge. The breath in my body, the blood in my veins, all this hurly-burly in my head existed for nobody.","Enforced maternity brings into the world wretched infants, whom their parents will be unable to support and who will become the victims of public care or \u2018child martyrs\u2019. It must be pointed out that our society, so concerned to defend the rights of the embryo, shows no interest in the children once they are born; it prosecutes the abortionists instead of undertaking to reform that scandalous institution known as \u2018public assistance\u2019; those responsible for entrusting the children to their torturers are allowed to go free; society closes its eyes to the frightful tyranny of brutes in children\u2019s asylums and private foster homes.","We will not let ourselves be intimidated by the number and violence of attacks against women; nor be fooled by the self-serving praise showered on the \u201creal woman; nor be won over by men\u2019s enthusiasm for her destiny, a destiny they would not for the world want to share.\u201d","The truth is that just as - biologically - males and females are never victims of one another but both victims of the species, so man and wife together undergo the oppression of an institution they did not create. If it is asserted that men oppress women, the husband is indignant; he feels that he is the one who is oppressed - and he is; but the fact is that it is the masculine code, it is the society developed by the males and in their interest, that has established woman\'s situation in a form that is at present a source of torment for both sexes.","Masculine desire is as much an offence as it is a compliment; in so far as she feels herself responsible for her charm, or feels she is exerting it of her own accord, she is much pleased with her conquests, but to the extent that her face, her figure, her flesh are facts she must bear with, she wants to hide them from this independent stranger who lusts after them.","The fact that we are human beings is infinitely more important than all the peculiarities that distinguish human beings from one another; it is never the given that confers superiorities: \u2018virtue\u2019, as the ancients called it, is defined on the level of \u2018that which depends on us\u2019.","Je sais qu\'on ne peut jamais se conna\xeetre, mais seulement se raconter.","Les livres que j\'aimais devinrent une Bible o\xf9 je puisais des conseils et des secours.","The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity.

We spent afternoons taking long walks, nights drinking and talking, and then we would leave each other, never to meet again, and there were no regrets. How simple life was. No regrets, no obligations, my acts and gestures counted for nothing, no one asked my advice, and I knew no other rule but my whims.","[Woman] is simply what man decrees; thus she is called \\"the sex,\\" by which is meant that she appears essentially to the male as a sexual being. For him she is sex -- absolute sex, no less. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute -- she is the Other.","To paint, to write, to engage in politics\u2014these are not merely \u2018sublimations\u2019; here we have aims that are willed for their own sakes. To deny it is to falsify all human history.","And yet we are told that femininity is in danger; we are exhorted to be women, remain women, become women. It would appear, then, that every female human being is not necessarily a woman; to be so considered she must share in that mysterious and threatened reality known as femininity. Is this attribute something secreted by the ovaries? Or is it Platonic essence, a product of the philosophic imagination? Is a rustling petticoat enough to bring it down to earth?","Insects were scurrying about in the shade cast by the grass, and the lawn was a huge monotonous forest of thousands of little green blades, all equal, all alike, hiding the world from each other. Anguished, she thought, \\"I don\'t want to be just another blade of grass.","In oppressing, one becomes oppressed. Men are enchained by reason of their very sovereignty; it is because they alone earn money that their wives demand checks, it is because they alone engage in a business or profession that their wives require them to be successful, it is because they alone embody transcendence that their wives wish to rob them of it by taking charge...","Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence.","Men of today seem to feel more acutely than ever the paradox of their condition. They know themselves to be the supreme end to which all action should be subordinated, but the exigencies of action force them to treat one another as instruments or obstacles, as means. The more widespread their mastery of the world, the more they find themselves crushed by uncontrollable forces. Though they are masters of the atomic bomb, yet it is created only to destroy them. Each one has the incomparable taste in his mouth of his own life, and yet each feels himself more insignificant than an insect within the immense collectivity whose limits are one with the earth\'s. Perhaps in no other age have they manifested their grandeur more brilliantly, and in no other age has this grandeur been so horribly flouted. In spite of so many stubborn lies, at every moment, at every opportunity, the truth comes to light, the truth of life and death, of my solitude and my bond with the world, of my freedom and my servitude, of the insignificance and the sovereign importance of each man and all men.","The adventure is which I have shared so passionately is not over--this adventure with its doubt, failure, the dreariness of no progress, then a glimpse of light, a hope, a hypothesis confirmed; and then after weeks and months of anxious perseverance, the intoxication of success.","My contemplation is an excruciation only because it is also a joy.","Je crois que je comprends bien comment ca peut te faire. Nous avons essay\xe9e de batir notre amour par-del\xe0 les instants, mais seuls les instants sont surs. Pour le reste on a besoin de foi; et la foi, est-ce courage ou paresse?","Literature took the place in my life that had once been occupied by religion: it absorbed me entirely, and transfigured my life.","...modern woman is everywhere permitted to regard her body as capital for exploitation.","biology alone cannot provide an answer to the question that concerns us: why is woman the Other? The question is how, in her, nature has been taken on in the course of history; the question is what humanity has made of the human female.","The truth is, however, that when two individuals detest each other, while being unable to get along without each other, it is not of all human relations the truest and most moving, but rather the most pitiable.","Ready-made phrases and the ritual of etiquette were unknown to him; his thoughtfulness was pure improvisation, and it resembled the little inventions affection inspires.","Women\u2019s actions have never been more than symbolic agitation; they have won only what men have been willing to concede to them; they have taken nothing; they have received.5 It is that they lack the concrete means to organize themselves into a unit that could posit itself in opposition. They have no past, no history, no religion of their own; and unlike the proletariat, they have no solidarity of labor or interests; they even lack their own space that makes communities of American blacks, the Jews in ghettos, or the workers in Saint-Denis or Renault factories. They live dispersed among men, tied by homes, work, economic interests, and social conditions to certain men\u2014fathers or husbands\u2014more closely than to other women. As bourgeois women, they are in solidarity with bourgeois men and not with women proletarians; as white women, they are in solidarity with white men and not with black women.","The validity of the cook\'s work is to be found only in the mouths of those at her table; she needs their approbation, demands that they appreciate her dishes and call for second helpings; she is upset if they are not hungry, to the point that one wonders whether the fried potatoes are for her husband or her husband for the fried potatoes.","If I were the earth it would disgust me, all this vermin on my back, I\u2019d shake it off.","Mystery is never more than a mirage that vanishes as we draw near to look at it.","One always has to wait until the sugar melts, the memory dies, the wound scars over, the sun sets, the unhappiness lifts and fades away.","At night I would climb the steps to the Sacre-Coeur, and I would watch Paris, that futile oasis, scintillating in the wilderness of space.

There is still an enormous difference between this heroine and the objective face that her parents and friends recognise in her. She is also convinced that she is misunderstood: her relationship with herself becomes even more passionate: she becomes intoxicated with her isolation, feels different, superior, exceptional: she promises that the future will take revenge on the mediocrity of her present life.

The tie that binds her to her oppressors is unlike any other. The division of the sexes is a biological given, not a moment in human history.

A new paradox is thereby introduced into his destiny. \u201cRational animal,\u201d \u201cthinking reed,\u201d he escapes from his natural condition without, however, freeing himself from it. He is still a part of this world of which he is a consciousness. He asserts himself as a pure internality against which no external power can take hold, and he also experiences himself as a thing crushed by the dark weight of other things. At every moment he can grasp the non-temporal truth of his existence. But between the past which no longer is and the future which is not yet, this moment when he exists is nothing. This privilege, which he alone possesses, of being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects, is what he shares with all his fellow-men. In turn an object for others, he is nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which he depends.\u201d","On nous exhorte: \'Soyez femmes, restez femmes, devenez femmes.\' Tout \xeatre humain femelle n\'est donc pas n\xe9cessairament une femme; il lui faut participer \xe0 cette r\xe9alit\xe9 myst\xe9rieuse et menac\xe9e qu\'est la f\xe9minit\xe9.

Think of something else - anything else: think of yesterday, a calm, ordinary, easy-flowing day, in spite of the nervous tension of waiting.","Woman is not a fixed reality but a becoming; she has to be compared with man in her becoming; that is, her possibilities have to be defined: what skews the issues so much is that she is being reduced to what she was, to what she is today, while the question concerns her capacities; the fact is that her capacities manifest themselves clearly only when they have been realized: but the fact is also that when one considers a being who is transcendence and surpassing, it is never possible to close the books.","The fact is that men encounter more complicity in their woman companions than the oppressor usually finds in the oppressed; and in bad faith they use it as a pretext to declare that woman wanted the destiny they imposed on her. We have seen that in reality her whole education conspires to bar her from paths of revolt and adventure; all of society - beginning with her respected parents - lies to her in extolling the high value of love, devotion, and the gift of self and in concealing the fact that neither lover, husband nor children will be disposed to bear the burdensome responsibility of it. She cheerfully accepts these lies because they invite her to take the easy slope: and that is the worst of the crimes committed against her; from her childhood and throughout her life, she is spoiled, she is corrupted by the fact that this resignation, tempting to any existent anxious about her freedom, is mean to be her vocation; if one encourages a child to be lazy by entertaining him all day, without giving him the occasion to study, without showing him its value, no one will say when he reaches the age of man that he chose to be incapable and ignorant; this is how the woman is raised, without ever being taught the necessity of assuming her own existence; she readily lets herself count on the protection, love, help and guidance of others; she lets herself be fascinated by the hope of being able to realise her being without doing anything. She is wrong to yield to this temptation; but the man is ill advised to reproach her for it since it is he himself who tempted her.","Every individual concerned to justify his existence feels that his existence involves an undefined need to transcend himself, to engage in freely chosen projects. pg. xxxiii","Economically, men and women almost form two castes; all things being equal, the former have better jobs, higher wages, and greater chances to succeed than their new female competitors; they occupy many more places in industry, in politics, and so forth, and they hold the most important positions.","Forced motherhood results in bringing miserable children into the world, children whose parents cannot feed them, who become victims of public assistance or \\"martyr children.\\" It must be pointed out that the same society so determined to defend the rights of the fetus shows no interest in children after they are born; instead of trying to reform this scandalous institution called public assistance, society prosecutes abortionists; those responsible for delivering orphans to torturers are left free; society closes its eyes to the horrible tyranny practiced in \\"reform schools\\" or in the private homes of child abusers; and while it refuses to accept that the fetus belongs to the mother carrying it, it nevertheless agrees that the child is his parents\' thing.","The fact is that a true human privilege is based upon the anatomical privilege only in virtue of the total situation.

The man most sympathetic to women never knows her concrete situation fully.","It was an odd experience, this bringing to life of pages born of my pen and forgotten. From time to time they interested me -- they surprised me as much as if someone else had written them; yet I recognized the vocabulary, the shape of the sentences, the drive, the elliptical forms, the mannerisms. These pages were soaked through and through with my self -- there was a sickening intimacy about it, like the smell of a bedroom in which one has been shut up too long.","Das Gl\xfcck besteht darin, zu leben wie alle Welt und doch wie kein anderer zu sein.","I hadn\'t known Chancel very well, but ten days earlier I had seen him laughing with the others around the Christmas tree. Maybe Robert was right; the distance between the living and the dead really isn\'t very great. And yet, like myself, those future corpses who were drinking their coffee in silence appeared ashamed to be so alive.","Mais le pire, quand on habite une prison sans barreaux, c\'est qu\'on n\'a pas m\xeame conscience des \xe9crans qui bouchent l\'horizon; j\'errais \xe0 travers un \xe9pais brouillard, et je le croyais transparent.

But in order for the Other not to turn into the One, the Other has to submit to this foreign point of view.","Ethics is the triumph of freedom over facticity.","It was easier for me to think of a world without a creator than of a creator burdened with all the contradictions in the world.","As far as I am concerned sexuality no longer exists. I used to call this indifference serenity: all at once I have come to see it in another light\u2014it is a mutilation; it is the loss of a sense. The lack of it makes me blind to the needs, the pains, and the joys of those who do possess it.","I would have to have a bit of heroism and get out of myself. But I love myself so much!","La stupidit\xe0 ci faceva ridere, era uno dei nostri grandi motivi di spasso, ma aveva anche qualcosa di spaventevole. Se avesse prevalso, non avremmo pi\xf9 avuto il diritto di pensare, di prendere in giro, di provare veri desideri, veri piaceri. Bisognava combatterla o rinunciare a vivere.","I enjoyed my exhaustion, though; I liked overdoing things","In the face of an obstacle which it is impossible to overcome, stubbornness is stupid. If I persist in beating my fist against a stone wall, my freedom exhausts itself in this useless gesture without succeeding in giving itself a content. It debases itself in a vain contingency. Yet, there is hardly a sadder virtue than resignation. It transforms into phantoms and contingent reveries projects which had at the beginning been set up as will and freedom. A young man has hoped for a happy or useful or glorious life. If the man he has become looks upon these miscarried attempts of his adolescence with disillusioned indifference, there they are, forever frozen in the dead past. When an effort fails, one declares bitterly that he has lost time and wasted his powers. The failure condemns that whole part of ourselves which we had engaged in the effort. It was to escape this dilemma that the Stoics preached indifference. We could indeed assert our freedom against all constraint if we agreed to renounce the particularity of our projects. If a door refuses to open, let us accept not opening it and there we are free. But by doing that, one manages only to save an abstract notion of freedom. It is emptied of all content and all truth. The power of man ceases to be limited because it is annulled. It is the particularity of the project which determines the limitation of the power, but it is also what gives the project its content and permits it to be set up. There are people who are filled with such horror at the idea of a defeat that they keep themselves from ever doing anything. But no one would dream of considering this gloomy passivity as the triumph of freedom","Yet I loathe the thought of annihilating myself quite as much now as I ever did. I think with sadness of all the books I\u2019ve read, all the places I\u2019ve seen, all the knowledge I\u2019ve amassed and that will be no more. All the music, all the paintings, all the culture, so many places: and suddenly nothing. ... If it had at least enriched the earth; if it had given birth to\u2026 what? A hill? A rocket? But no. Nothing will have taken place. I can still see the hedge of hazel trees flurried by the wind and the promises with which I fed my beating heart while I stood gazing at the gold-mine at my feet: a whole life to live. The promises have all been kept. And yet, turning an incredulous gaze towards that young and credulous girl, I realise with stupor how much I was gypped.","La fatalit\xe9 triomphe d\xe8s que l\'on croit en elle.","They use the pretext of avoiding war, to make you swallow any kind of peace, said Paul.

My curiosity embraced everything; I believed in an absolute truth, in the need for moral law; my thoughts adapted themselves to their objects; if occasionally one of them took me by surprise, it was because it reflected something that was surprising. I preferred good to evil and despised that which should be despised. I could find no trace of my own subjectivity. I had wanted myself to be boundless, and I had become as shapeless as the infinite.

The reciprocity of their relations will not do away with the miracles \u2013 desire, possession, love, dream, adventure \u2013 worked by the division of human beings into two separate categories; and the words that move us \u2013 giving, conquering, uniting \u2013 will not lose their meaning.

However, far from God\'s absence authorizing all license, the contrary is the case, because man is abandoned on the earth, because his acts are definitive, absolute engagements.

By contrast, the fact of existence here and now sometimes took on a glorious splendour.","Sewers are necessary to guarantee the wholesomeness of palaces, according to the Fathers of the Church. And it has often been remarked that the necessity exists of sacrificing one part of the female sex in order to save the other and prevent worse troubles. One of the arguments in support of slavery, advanced by the American supporters of the institution, was that the Southern whites, being all freed from servile duties, could maintain the most democratic and refined relations among themselves; in the same way, a caste of \'shameless women\' allows the \'honest woman\' to be treated with the most chivalrous respect. The prostitute is a scapegoat; man vents his turpitude upon her, and he rejects her. Whether she is put legally under police supervision or works illegally in secret, she is in any case treated as a pariah.","M\xeame les manifestations et les initiatives f\xe9minines n\'ont pris de valeur que lorsqu\'une d\xe9cision masculine les a efficacement prolong\xe9es.","(\u2026) symbolism did not fall out of heaven or rise out of subterranean depths: it was elaborated like language, by the human reality\u2026","Between women love is contemplation; caresses are meant less to appropriate the other than to recreate oneself slowly through her; separation is eliminated, there is neither fight nor victory nor defeat; each one is both subject and object","But the answer is obvious: it is easy to believe one is sovereign when alone, to believe oneself strong when carefully refusing to bear any burden.","This privilege, which he alone possesses, of being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects, is what he shares with all his fellow-men. In turn an object for others, he is nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which he depends.","The relation of woman to husband, of of daughter to father, of sister to brother, is a relation of vassalage.","As Merleau Ponty very justly puts it, man is not a natural species: he\'s a historical idea. Woman is not a completed reality, but rather a becoming, and it is in her becoming that she should be compared with man; that is to say, her possibilities should be defined. What gives rise to much of the debate is the tendency to reduce her to what she has been, to what she is today, in raising the question of her capabilities; for the fact is that capabilities are clearly manifested only when they are realized - but the fact is also that when we have to do with a being whose nature is transcendent action, we can never close the books.","I was too enamored of truth ever to mourn lost illusions.","If I had rediscovered in Heaven, amplified to infinity, the monstrous alliance of fragility and implacability, of caprice and artificial necessity which had oppressed me since my birth, rather than worship Him I would have chosen damnation.","She had appetites in plenty: she spent all her strength in repressing them and she underwent this denial in anger.","Suddenly I was struck motionless: I was living through the first chapter of a novel in which I was the heroine; she was still almost a child, but we, too, were growing up.","These women are, quite simply, alive; they know that the source of true values is not in external things but in human hearts. This gives its charm to the world they live in: they banish ennui by the simple fact of their presence, with their dreams, their desires, their pleasures, their emotions, their ingenuities. The sanseverina, that \'active soul\' dreads ennui more than death. To stagnate in ennui \'is to keep from dying, she said, not to live\'; she is \' always impassioned over something, always in action and gay too \'. Thoughtless, childish or profound, gay or grave, daring or secretive, they all reject the heavy sleep in which humanity is mired. And these women who have been able to maintain their liberty- empty as it has been- will rise through passion to heroism once they find an objective worthy of them; their spiritual power, their energy, suggest the fierce purity of total dedication","Y con la amistad pasa como con el amor f\xedsico: para que sea aut\xe9ntica tiene que ser ante todo libre.","Peut-\xeatre vas-tu me trouver ridicule, mais je me m\xe9priserais de n\'oser l\'\xeatre jamais.","All around me the world lies like an immense hypothesis that I no longer verify.","The Social Security\'s medical consultants support the interest not of the victims but of the organization.","It must feel wonderfully strange when, like Manette, one stands there, the only witness to a vanished world.","Faith allows an evasion of those difficulties which the atheist confronts honestly. And to crown all, the believer derives a sense of great superiority from this very cowardice itself.","depopulates it. Nothing exists outside of his stubborn project; therefore nothing can induce him to modify his choices. And having involved his whole life with an external object which can continually escape him, he tragically feels his dependence. Even if it does not definitely disappear, the object never gives itself. The passionate man makes himself a lack of being not that there might be being, but in order to be. And he remains at a distance; he is never fulfilled.","Constituye una paradoja criminal rehusar a la mujer toda actividad p\xfablica, cerrarle las carreras masculinas, proclamar en todos los dominios su incapacidad y confiarle, al mismo tiempo, la empresa m\xe1s delicada y m\xe1s grave de cuantas existen...la formaci\xf3n de un ser humano.","And it\u2019s the same thing everywhere all the time whether they\u2019re stuffing themselves with chips paella or pizza it\u2019s the same crew a filthy crew the rich who trample over you the poor who hate you for your money the old who dodder the young who sneer the men who show off the women who open their legs.

A freedom which is interested only in denying freedom must be denied. And it is not true that the recognition of the freedom of others limits my own freedom: to be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future; the existence of others as a freedom defines my situation and is even the condition of my own freedom.

Donaldson, a historian of woman, observed that the definitions \\"the man is a male human being, the woman is a female human being\\" were asymmetrically mutilated; psychoanalysts in particular define man as a human being and woman as a female: every time she acts like a human being, the woman is said to be imitating the male.","N\u2019oubliez jamais qu\u2019il suffira d\u2019une crise politique, \xe9conomique ou religieuse pour que les droits des femmes soient remis en question.

Dostoievsky asserted, \u201cIf God does not exist, everything is permitted. Today\u2019s believers use this formula for their own advantage. To re-establish man at the heart of his destiny is, they claim, to repudiate all ethics. However, far from God\u2019s absence authorizing all license, the contrary is the case, because man is abandoned on the earth, because his acts are definitive, absolute engagements. He bears the responsibility for a world which is not the work of a strange power, but of himself, where his defeats are inscribed, and his victories as well.\u201d","Thus, the triumph of patriarchy was neither an accident nor the result of a violent revolution. From the origins of humanity, their biological privilege enabled men to affirm themselves alone as sovereign subjects; they never abdicated this privilege; they alienated part of their existence in Nature and in Woman; but they won it back afterward; condemned to play the role of the Other, woman was thus condemned to possess no more than precarious power: slave or idol, she was never the one who chose her lot.","I asked Isabelle whether she was happy. \u201cI never ask myself, so I suppose the answer is yes.

But could he fill this emptiness within me? Had he loved me as I loved him? At the beginning I think he did; or rather the question never arose of either of us, for we were so happy together.

Thus, to say that action has to be lived in its truth, that is, in the consciousness of the antinomies which it involves, does not mean that one has to renounce it. In Plutarch Lied Pierrefeu rightly says that in war there is no victory which can not be regarded as unsuccessful, for the objective which one aims at is the total annihilation of the enemy and this result is never attained; yet there are wars which are won and wars which are lost. So is it with any activity; failure and success are two aspects of reality which at the start are not perceptible. That is what makes criticism so easy and art so difficult: the critic is always in a good position to show the limits that every artist gives himself in choosing himself; painting is not given completely either in Giotto or Titian or Cezanne; it is sought through the centuries and is never finished; a painting in which all pictorial problems are resolved is really inconceivable; painting itself is this movement toward its own reality; it is not the vain displacement of a millstone turning in the void; it concretizes itself on each canvas as an absolute existence. Art and science do not establish themselves despite failure but through it; which does not prevent there being truths and errors, masterpieces and lemons, depending upon whether the discovery or the painting has or has not known how to win the adherence of human consciousnesses; this amounts to saying that failure, always ineluctable, is in certain cases spared and in others not.","The passionate man seeks possession; he seeks to attain being.

She reacts by a \u201cmasculine protest; she either tries to masculinize herself or uses her feminine wiles to go into battle against man. Through motherhood she can find in her child the equivalent of the penis. But this supposes that she must first accept herself completely as woman, and thus accept her inferiority.

All the creation myths express this conviction that is precious to the male, for example, the Genesis legend, which, through Christianity, has spanned Western civilization. Eve was not formed at the same time as man; she was not made either from a different substance or from the same clay that Adam was modeled from: she was drawn from the first male\u2019s flank. Even her birth was not autonomous; God did not spontaneously choose to create her for herself and to be directly worshiped in turn: he destined her for man; he gave her to Adam to save him from loneliness, her spouse is her origin and her finality; she is his complement in the inessential mode. Thus, she appears a privileged prey. She is nature raised to the transparency of consciousness; she is a naturally submissive consciousness. And therein lies the marvelous hope that man has often placed in woman: he hopes to accomplish himself as being through carnally possessing a being while making confirmed in his freedom by a docile freedom. No man would consent to being a woman, but all want there to be women. \u201cThank God for creating woman. \u201cNature is good because it gave men woman.\u201d In these and other similar phrases, man once more asserts arrogantly and naively that his presence in this world is an inevitable fact and a right, that of woman is a simple accident\u2014but a fortunate one. Appearing as the Other, woman appears at the same time as a plenitude of being by opposition to the nothingness of existence that man experiences in itself; the Other, posited as object in the subject\u2019s eyes, is posited as in-itself, thus as being. Woman embodies positively the lack the existent carries in his heart, and man hopes to realize himself by finding himself through her.\u201d","Trudno bowiem m\u0119\u017cczy\u017anie oceni\u0107 ogromne znaczenie dyskryminacji spo\u0142ecznych, kt\xf3re na zewn\u0105trz wydaj\u0105 si\u0119 b\u0142ahe, a kt\xf3rych konsekwencje moralne i intelektualne tkwi\u0105 w kobiecie tak g\u0142\u0119boko, \u017ce wydaj\u0105 si\u0119 mie\u0107 \u017ar\xf3d\u0142o w jej pierwotnej strukturze.","Mi acci\xf3n no es para otro sino lo que \xe9l mismo la hace ser: \xbfc\xf3mo puedo, pues, saber de antemano lo que hago?; y si no lo s\xe9, \xbfc\xf3mo puedo proponerme obrar por la humanidad?","It was not murder that fulfilled Sade\'s erotic nature; it was literature.","\xabNo se muere de haber nacido, ni de haber vivido, ni de vejez.

Se la societ\xe0 dovesse pagare quel lavoro \xe8 evidente che ci\xf2 aumenterebbe enormemente tutte le sue spese. \xc8 un grandissimo vantaggio per la societ\xe0 avere donne che fanno questo enorme lavoro per niente.Come ottenere allora che la donna faccia questo lavoro? Bisogna condizionarla. Dato che \xe8 difficile convincerla che essa ha la vocazione di lavare i patti, si \xe8 trovato qualcosa di meglio.Si esalta la maternit\xe0, perch\xe9 la maternit\xe0 offre il modo di tenere la donna in casa e di farle fare le faccende domestiche. Invece di dire alla bambina di due, tre o quattro anni: \xabSei destinata a lavare i piatti\xbb le si dice \xabSei destinata ad essere madre\xbb; le regalano bambole, si esalta la maternit\xe0, in modo che quando diventa una ragazza non pensa ad altro, pensa soltanto a sposarsi e ad avere bambini. La si \xe8 convinta che non sar\xe0 una donna completa se non avr\xe0 bambini. Quando una donna non ha figli, si dice: \xabNon \xe8 una vera donna\xbb, ma quando un uomo non ha figli non si dice: \xabNon \xe8 un vero uomo\xbb.Bisogna dunque che la donna sia asservita alla maternit\xe0. Se almeno avesse la libert\xe0 di essere madre quando vuole, nella misura in cui lo vuole, pianificando le nascite dei figli, avrebbe molta pi\xfa libert\xe0 in tutti i campi. Potrebbe rivaleggiare con l\u2019uomo sul piano professionale, non sarebbe per tutta la vita inchiodata in casa; e cos\xed si porrebbe il problema di perch\xe9 non debba essere l\u2019uomo a lavare i piatti.Per evitare che ci\xf2 avvenga, bisogna dunque imporre la maternit\xe0 alla donna e imporgliela suo malgrado. Per questa ragione da quando esiste la possibilit\xe0 di controllare le nascite, non si \xe8 mai cercato di facilitarne la messa in pratica, al punto che in Francia attualmente c\u2019\xe8 solo il 7 per cento di donne che si servono di metodi anticoncezionali. \xc8 anche per questo che il governo, in questo momento, sta ritirando tutte le sovvenzioni alla Pianificazione familiare, la sola organizzazione che si \xe8 occupata di informare le donne. Il governo, tuttavia, riconosce di non avere alcuna soluzione di ricambio; ed \xe8 una cosa molto grave. Non solo si sopprime la Pianificazione familiare e le si tolgono le possibilit\xe0 di agire, ma non si prevede niente al suo posto. Si impedisce dunque alle donne di difendersi dal concepimento quando non lo desiderano. E cos\xed rimangono incinte loro malgrado.Non resta allora altro che procurarsi l\u2019aborto, e cos\xed fanno un milione di donne francesi ogni anno, malgrado questa legge che di fatto non impedisce niente e che quindi non ha alcun senso. Ogni tanto si d\xe0 ad essa un\u2019apparenza di esistenza, accusando qualche donna, sempre scelta tra le pi\xfa diseredate, perch\xe9 non si \xe8 mai vista la moglie di un magistrato, di un ministro o di un grande industriale seduta al posto in cui stanno le accusate di oggi.Eppure si pu\xf2 essere sicuri che ci sono altrettanti aborti in quegli ambienti come negli altri. La legge opprime tutte le donne, anche quelle che sono privilegiate.Nella mia vita ho visto arrivare a casa mia in lacrime non solo operaie o impiegate, ma donne borghesi che avevano denaro; una volta ho perfino aiutato la moglie di un grande direttore di banca. Nonostante tutto, le donne sono isolate; anche col denaro, non si hanno sempre gli indirizzi che occorrono e non si sa a chi rivolgersi.Come dicevo in principio, si \xe8 inculcato nell\u2019animo delle donne un tale senso di colpa, che l\u2019aborto diviene per loro qualcosa di traumatizzante, mentre non lo sarebbe affatto se avvenisse in condizioni legali.","Today, the majority of workers are exploited.

Relieved of a great number of reproductive servitudes, she can take on the economic roles open to her, roles that would ensure her control over her own person.","And we can see why all comparisons where we try to decide if the woman is superior, inferior, or equal to the man are pointless: their situations are profoundly different. If these same situations are compared, it is obvious that the man\u2019s is infinitely preferable, that is to say, he has far more concrete opportunities to project his freedom in the world; the inevitable result is that masculine realizations outweigh by far those of women: for women, it is practically forbidden to do anything. But to compare the use that, within their limits, men and women make of their freedom is a priori meaningless, precisely because they use it freely. In various forms, the traps of bad faith and the mystifications of seriousness are lying in wait for both of them; freedom is entire in each. However, because of the fact that in woman this freedom remains abstract and empty, it cannot authentically assume itself except in revolt: this is the only way open to those who have no chance to build anything; they must refuse the limits of their situation and seek to open paths to the future; resignation is only a surrender and an evasion; for woman there is no other way out than to work for her liberation.","\xc7a ne rapproche pas, le t\xe9l\xe9phone, \xe7a confirme les distances.","Scents, patterns of light and shade, winds and hurricanes \u2014 all pulsed inwardly through my own sinews and veins: so much so, indeed, that the throb of my blood stream, the swarming growth of my cells, the whole mystery of life housed within me seemed to be echoed by the shrilling cicadas, the gusts of wind that shook the trees, and the faint crunch of the moss as I trod it underfoot.","The fundamental fault of the nihilist is that, challenging all given values, he does not find, beyond their ruin, the importance of that universal, absolute end which freedom itself is. It is possible that, even in this failure, a man may nevertheless keep his taste for an existence which he originally felt as a joy. Hoping for no justification, he will nevertheless take delight in living. He will not turn aside from things which he does not believe in. He will seek a pretext in them for a gratuitous display of activity. Such a man is what is generally called an adventurer. He throws himself into his undertakings with zest, into exploration, conquest, war, speculation, love, politics, but he does not attach himself to the end at which he aims; only to his conquest. He likes action for its own sake. He finds joy in spreading through the world a freedom which remains indifferent to its content. Whether the taste for adventure appears to be based on nihilistic despair or whether it is born directly from the experience of the happy days of childhood, it always implies that freedom is realized as an independence in regard to the serious world and that, on the other hand, the ambiguity of existence is felt not as a lack but in its positive aspect. This attitude dialectically envelops nihilism\u2019s opposition to the serious and the opposition to nihilism by existence as such. But, of course, the concrete history of an individual does not necessarily espouse this dialectic, by virtue of the fact that his condition is wholly present to him at each moment and because his freedom before it is, at every moment, total. From the time of his adolescence a man can define himself as an adventurer. The union of an original, abundant vitality and a reflective scepticism will particularly lead to this choice.","Ce ne sont pas les individus qui sont responsables de l\'\xe9chec du mariage: c\'est l\'institution elle-m\xeame qui est originellement pervertie","Paule n\'en pas \xe0 une contradiction pr\xe8s, mais celle-ci aga\xe7ait particuli\xe8rement Henri : elle le voulait le plus glorieux de tous les hommes, et elle affectait de m\xe9priser la gloire ; c\'est qu\'elle s\'ent\xeatait \xe0 se r\xeaver telle qu\'il l\'avait r\xeav\xe9e, jadis : hautaine, sublime ; et en m\xeame temps, bien s\xfbr, elle vivait sur terre, comme tout le monde.","C\'est seulement depuis que les femmes commencent \xe0 se sentir chez elles sur cette terre qu\'on a vu appara\xeetre une Rosa Luxembourg, une Mme.

But we must stop there. The perpetuation of the species does not necessitate sexual differentiation. True enough, this differentiation is characteristic of existents to such an extent that it belongs in any realistic definition of existence. But it nevertheless remains true that both a mind without a body and an immortal man are strictly inconceivable, whereas we can imagine a parthenogenetic or hermaphroditic society.","Perch\xe9 le parole, questa precisione brutale che maltratta le nostre complicazioni?","Arapski geograf El Bekri, govore\u0107i o Slovenima, ka\u017ee: \\"Ako se o\u017eeni i vidi da je njegova \u017eena nevina, on joj ka\u017ee: \\"Da si ne\u0161to vredela, mu\u0161karci bi te voleli i na\u0161ao bi se jedan koji bi ti oduzeo nevinost.\\" Zatim je otera i odri\u010de je se.","The moment you acknowledge my conscience, you know that I acknowledge one in you, too.

Only in a socialist world would the woman who has one be sure of the other. Today, the majority of workers are exploited. Moreover, social structures have not been deeply modified by the changes in women\u2019s condition. This world has always belonged to men and still retains the form they have imprinted on it. It is important not to lose sight of these facts that make the question of women\u2019s work complex.","The bourgeois woman clings to the chains because she clings to her class privileges. It is drilled into her and she believes that women\u2019s liberation would weaken bourgeois society; liberated from the male, she would be condemned to work; while she might regret having her rights to private property subordinated to her husband\u2019s, she would deplore even more having this property abolished; she feels no solidarity with working-class women: she feels closer to her husband than to a woman textile worker. She makes his interests her own.","The thing that attracted me about philosophy was that it went straight to essentials.

He wanted to believe in them. He stood in front of one of the canvases. Between the two walls, drenched in sunlight, a single hoop rolled towards that point where the parallels meet in infinity. Little by little, as he looked at it, the picture came alive. What it was saying he could not be translated into words; it was said in painting and no other language could have expressed its meaning; but it spoke. He advanced a few paces. Under his attentive gaze, all the pictures came alive; they awoke memories more ancient than the beginning of the world; they evoked the unpredictable face of the earth far beyond the revolutions to come; they exposed the secrets of a jagged coastline, of a dessert sprinkled with shells, as they remained solitary within themselves, protected from any conscience. Statues without faces, men turned to pillars of salt, landscapes scorched by the flames of death, oceans frozen into immobility of the absolute instant: these were the thousand shapes of absence. And while he looked at this universe devoid of onlookers, it seemed as if he were absent from himself, and that he remained, outside his own personal history, in an empty white eternity.

Popular opinion is quite right in admiring a man who, having been ruined or having suffered an accident, knows how to gain the upper hand, that is, renew his engagement in the world, thereby strongly asserting the independence of freedom in relation to thing. Thus, when the sick Van Gogh calmly accepted the prospect of a future in which he would be unable to paint any more, there was no sterile resignation. For him painting was a personal way of life and of communication with others which in another form could be continued even in an asylum. The past will be integrated and freedom will be confirmed in a renunciation of this kind. It will be lived in both heartbreak and joy. In heartbreak, because the project is then robbed of its particularity \u2014 it sacrifices its flesh and blood. But in joy, since at the moment one releases his hold, he again finds his hands free and ready to stretch out toward a new future. But this act of passing beyond is conceivable only if what the content has in view is not to bar up the future, but, on the contrary, to plan new possibilities. This brings us back by another route to what we had already indicated. My freedom must not seek to trap being but to disclose it. The disclosure is the transition from being to existence. The goal which my freedom aims at is conquering existence across the always inadequate density of being.","\xab Exister, c\u2019est oser se jeter dans le monde. \xbb","I\'m not jealous of your feelings for people.

In the ants, bees, and termites the larval nutrition determines whether the genotypic female individual will become a fully developed female (\u2018queen\u2019) or a sexually retarded worker. In these cases the whole organism is affected; but the gonads do not play a part in establishing the sexual differences of the body, or soma. In the vertebrates, however, the hormones secreted by the gonads are the essential regulators. Numerous experiments show that by varying the hormonal (endocrine) situation, sex can be profoundly affected. Grafting and castration experiments on adult animals and man have contributed to the modern theory of sexuality, according to which the soma is in a way identical in male and female vertebrates. It may be regarded as a kind of neutral element upon which the influence of the gonad imposes the sexual characteristics. Some of the hormones secreted by the gonad act as stimulators, others as inhibitors. Even the genital tract itself is somatic, and embryological investigations show that it develops in the male or female direction from an indifferent and in some respects hermaphroditic condition under the hormonal influence. Intersexuality may result when the hormones are abnormal and hence neither one of the two sexual potentialities is exclusively realised.","Mi ero voluta senza limiti ed ero informe come l\'infinito. La cosa paradossale \xe8 che mi accorsi di questa deficienza proprio nel momento in cui scoprivo la mia individualit\xe0: la mia pretesa al\'universale fin allora mi era apparsa ovvi, e invece, ecco che diveniva un tratto di carattere. \\"Simone si interessa di tutto\\". Mi trovavo delimitata dal mio rifiuto dei limiti.","As soon as one considers a system abstractly and theoretically, one puts himself, in effect, on the plane of the universal, thus, of the infinite. That is why reading the Hegelian system is so comforting. I remember having experienced a great feeling of calm on reading Hegel in the impersonal framework of the Bibliotheque Nationale in August 1940. But once I got into the street again, into my life, out of the system, beneath a real sky, the system was no longer of any use to me: what it had offered me, under a show of the infinite, was the consolations of death; and I again wanted to live in the midst of living men. I think that, inversely, existentialism does not offer to the reader the consolations of an abstract evasion: existentialism proposes no evasion. On the contrary, its ethics is experienced in the truth of life, and it then appears as the only proposition of salvation which one can address to men. Taking on its own account Descartes\' revolt against the evil genius, the pride of the thinking reed in the face of the universe which crushes him, it asserts that, despite his limits, through them, it is up to each one to fulfill his existence as an absolute. Regardless of the staggering dimensions of the world about us, the density of our ignorance, the risks of catastrophes to come, and our individual weakness within the immense collectivity, the fact remains that we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite. And in fact, any man who has known real loves, real revolts, real desires, and real will knows quite well that he has no need of any outside guarantee to be sure of his goals; their certitude comes from his own drive. There is a very old saying which goes: \\"Do what you must, come what may.\\" That amounts to saying in a different way that the result is not external to the good will which fulfills itself in aiming at it. If it came to be that each man did what he must, existence would be saved in each one without there being any need of dreaming of a paradise where all would be reconciled in death.","To exist genuinely is not to deny this spontaneous movement of my transcendence, but only to refuse to lose myself in it.","No dia que for poss\xedvel \xe0 mulher amar em sua for\xe7a e n\xe3o em sua fraqueza, n\xe3o para fugir de si mesma, mas para se encontrar, n\xe3o para se renunciar, mas para se afirmar, nesse dia o amor tornar-se-\xe1 para ela, como para o homem, fonte de vida e n\xe3o perigo mortal.","Woman is lost. Where are the women? Today\'s women are not women\\"; we have seen what these mysterious slogans mean. In the eyes of men \u2014 and of the legions of women who see through these eyes \u2014 it is not enough to have a woman\'s body or to take on the female function as lover and mother to be a \\"real woman\\"; it is possible for the subject to claim autonomy through sexuality and maternity; the \\"real woman\\" is one who accepts herself as Other. The duplicitous attitude of men today creates a painful split for women; they accept, for the most part, that woman be a peer, an equal; and yet they continue to oblige her to remain the inessential; for her, these two destinies are not reconcilable; she hesitates between them without being exactly suited to either, and that is the source of her lack of balance.","When a young sixteen-year old Nazi died crying, \u201cHeil Hitler! he was not guilty, and it was not he whom we hated but his masters. The desirable thing would be to re-educate this misled youth; it would be necessary to expose the mystification and to put the men who are its victims in the presence of their freedom. But the urgency of the struggle forbids this slow labor. We are obliged to destroy not only the oppressor but also those who serve him, whether they do so out of ignorance or out of constraint.\u201d","CHAPTER ONE Henri found himself looking at the sky again \u2013 a clear, black crystal dome overhead. It was difficult for the mind to conceive of hundreds of planes shattering that black crystalling silence! And suddenly, words began tumbling through his head with a joyous sound \u2013 the offensive was halted \u2026 the German collapse had begun \u2026 at last he would be able to leave. He turned the corner of the quay. The streets would smell again of oil and orange blossoms, in the evening there would be light, people would sit and chat in outdoor caf\xe9s, and he would drink real coffee to the sound of guitars.","Tak ako v Amerike nie je probl\xe9m \u010dernochov, ale probl\xe9m bielych, tak ako \u201eantisemitizmus nie je probl\xe9m \u017eidovsk\xfd, ale probl\xe9m n\xe1\u0161,\u201c tak probl\xe9m \u017eeny bol v\u017edy probl\xe9mom mu\u017eov.","Hay que a\xf1adir que los hombres m\xe1s respetuosos con al vida embrionaria son tambi\xe9n lo que m\xe1s prontos se muestran cuando se trata de condenar adultos a una muerte militar.","Es desde el coraz\xf3n de mi vida, que yo deseo, prefiero, rechazo.","...for not only does the woman of fashion project herself into things, she has chosen to make herself a thing.","Le nihiliste a raison de penser que le monde no poss\xe8de aucune justification et que lui-m\xeame n\'est rien; mais il oublie qu\'il lui appartient de justifier le monde et de se faire exister valablement.","Rodi\u010dia e\u0161te vychov\xe1vaj\xfa svoje dc\xe9ry rad\u0161ej pre man\u017eelstvo, ne\u017e by podporovali ich osobn\xfd rozvoj.

One renounces being in order that there may be that being which one is not.","How, indeed, could the myth of Cinderella not keep all its validity? Everything still encourages the young girl to expect fortune and happiness from some Prince Charming rather than to attempt by herself their difficult and uncertain conquest.","Parents still bring up their daughters with a view to marriage rather than to furthering her personal development; she sees so many advantages in it that she herself wishes for it; the result is that she is often less specially trained, less solidly grounded than her brothers, she is less deeply involved in her profession. In this way she dooms herself to remain in it its lower level, to be inferior; and the vicious circle is formed : this professional inferiority reinforces her desire to find a husband.","O homem \xe9 livre; mas ele encontra a lei na sua pr\xf3pria liberdade.","Tous les g\xe9nies qui naissent femmes sont perdus pour le bonheur du public; d\xe8s que le hasard leur donne les moyens de se montrer, voyez-les atteindre aux talents les plus difficiles.\\" Le pire handicap qu\'elles aient \xe0 supporter, c\'est l\'\xe9ducation dont on les abrutit; l\'oppresseur s\'attache toujours \xe0 diminuer ceux qu\'il opprime; c\'est \xe0 dessein que l\'homme refuse aux femmes leurs chances.","La litt\xe9rature appara\xeet lorsque quelque chose dans la vie se d\xe9r\xe8gle [...]","The nihilist is right in thinking that the world _possesses_ no justification and that he himself _is_ nothing. But he forgets that it is up to him to justify the world and to make himself exist validly.","\xabNo hay que creer en el Pr\xedncipe Azul.

Simons and Jessica Benjamin in 1979.32","Of all these myths, none is more firmly anchored masculine hearts than that of the feminine\'mystery\'. It has numerous advantages. And first of all it permits an easy explanation of all thatappears inexplicable; the man who \u2018\u2019does not understand\u2019\u2019 a woman is happy to substitute anobjective resistance for a subjective deficiency of mind; instead of admitting his ignorance, heperceives the presence of a \'mystery\' outside himself; an alibi, indeed, that flatters laziness andvanity at once.","In many cases, the man can commit acts with woman\u2019s complicity that degrade her without tarnishing his lofty image.","One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman","To want to prohibit a man from error is to forbid him to fulfill his own existence, it is to deprive him of life.","only the subject can justify his own existence; no external subject, no object, can bring him salvation from the outside. He can not be regarded as a nothing, since the consciousness of all things is within him.","Love in the modern sense does not exist in antiquity except outside of official society, notes Engels: at the very point where antiquity broke off its penchant for sexual love, the Middle Ages took it up again with adultery. And this is the form that love will take as long as the institution of marriage lasts.\u201d","En la Naturaleza, nada est\xe1 nunca completamente claro: los tipos, macho y hembra, no siempre se distinguen con nitidez.","The nihilist attitude manifests a certain truth. In this attitude one experiences the ambiguity of the human condition. But the mistake is that it defines man not as the positive existence of a lack, but as a lack at the heart of existence, whereas the truth is that existence is not a lack as such. And if freedom is experienced in this case in the form of rejection, it is not genuinely fulfilled. The nihilist is right in thinking that the world possesses no justification and that he himself is nothing. But he forgets that it is up to him to justify the world and to make himself exist validly. Instead of integrating death into life, he sees in it the only truth of the life, which appears to him as a disguised death. However, there is life, and the nihilist knows that he is alive. That\u2019s where his failure lies. He rejects existence without managing to eliminate it. He denies any meaning to his transcendence, and yet he transcends himself. A man who delights in freedom can find an ally in the nihilist because they contest the serious world together, but he also sees in him an enemy insofar as the nihilist is a systematic rejection of the world and man, and if this rejection ends up in a positive desire destruction, it then establishes a tyranny which freedom must stand up against.","Their behavior is defined and can be judged only within this given situation, and it is possible that in this situation, limited like every human situation, they realize a perfect assertion of their freedom. But once there appears a possibility of liberation, it is resignation of freedom not to exploit the possibility, a resignation which implies dishonesty and which is a positive fault.","Our hold on the future is limited; the movement of expansion of existence requires that we strive at every moment to amplify it; but where it stops our future stops too; beyond, there is nothing more because nothing more is disclosed.","Ser libre es lanzarse en el mundo sin c\xe1lculo, sin apuestas, es definir uno mismo toda apuesta, toda medida.","That is why Saint-Just, who believed in the individual and who knew that all authority is violence, said with somber lucidity, \u201cNo one governs innocently.","Let us live before asking us to justify our existence","Time vanishes behind those who leave this world, and the older I get the more my past years draw together.","Es wird Abend, aber die Luft ist noch lau. Dies ist einer jener ergreifender Augenblicke, in denen Erde und Menschen so vollkommen miteinander harmonieren, dass es unm\xf6glich scheint, jemanden zu finden, der nicht gl\xfccklich ist.","Of all these myths none is more firmly anchored in masculine hearts than that of the feminine \\"mystery\\". It has numerous advantages. And first of all it permits an easy explanation of all that appears inexplicable; the man who \\"does not understand\\" a woman is happy to substitute an objective resistance for a subjective deficiency of mind; instead of admitting his ignorance, he perceives the presence of a \\"mystery\\" outside himself; an alibi, indeed, that flatters laziness and vanity at once.","In 1949 Beauvoir could see that women would be able to shed their old skins and cut their own clothes, only \u2018if there is a collective change\u2019 (see here).","It is clear that all the faults for which the adolescent girl is reproached merely express her situation. It is a painful condition to know one is passive and dependent at the age of hope and ambition, at the age when the will to live and to take a place in the world intensifies; woman learns at this conquering age that no conquest is allowed her, that she must disavow herself, that her future depends on men\'s good offices. New social and sexual aspirations are awakened, but they are condemned to remain unsatisfied; all her vital or spiritual impulses are immediately barred.","I got the desire to write very young, at fourteen or fifteen years of age \u2026 I endured the world which was given to me sometimes with joy, often with revolt or boredom; I wanted to make it mine in order to justify it in some way. So I thought I had everything to say: the whole world, life, everything. In my youthful, adolescent diaries, at eighteen, nineteen years old, this leitmotif appears over and over: I will say everything, I have everything to say.","And so, quite unable to fulfil himself in solitude, man is incessantly in danger in his relations with his fellows: his life is a difficult enterprise with success never assured.","Je me passerais bien, comme vous pouvez le penser, de toutes ces distractions; c\'est si assommant de s\'amuser quand on n\'en sent \xe0 aucun degr\xe9 le besoin.","Cada manh\xe3, antes mesmo de abrir os olhos, ela reconhecia sua cama, seu quarto. Mas, \xe0s vezes, quando dormia de tarde, experimentava ao acordar aquela estupefa\xe7\xe3o pueril: por que eu sou eu? Como se a consci\xeancia, emergindo despercebida do sono, hesitasse antes de se reencarnar. O que a surpreendia \u2014 como a crian\xe7a quando toma consci\xeancia de sua pr\xf3pria identidade \u2014 era se encontrar no \xe2mago de sua pr\xf3pria vida e n\xe3o na de outra pessoa: por qual acaso? Ela poderia n\xe3o ter nascido: ent\xe3o n\xe3o teria havido quest\xe3o. \u201cEu poderia ter sido uma outra, mas ent\xe3o teria sido uma outra que se interrogaria sobre si.

I resented his gaiety now that I had become low-spirited.","Not only do we assert that the existentialist doctrine permits the elaboration of an ethics, but it even appears to us as the only philosophy in which an ethics has its place.","Es en el objeto finito que crea, donde el hombre, encontrar\xe1 un reflejo fijo de su trascendencia.","[Women] have no history, religion of their own, and they are not like the proletarian solidarity work and interests (\u2026) They live dispersed among men, attached by housing, labor, economic, social condition in some men \u2013 fathers or husbands \u2013 more closely than other women","Vid sidan av varje individs anspr\xe5k p\xe5 att h\xe4vda sig som subjekt, vilket \xe4r ett etiskt anspr\xe5k, finns det i sj\xe4lva verket ocks\xe5 inom individen en frestelse att undfly friheten och bli till ett ting.

A lua brilhava, como a estrelinha que a acompanha fielmente, e Nicole se lembrou dos versos bonitos de Aucassin e Nicolette: \u201cEstrelinha, eu te vi/ Que a lua traz a si. Esta \xe9 a vantagem da literatura, pensou ela: n\xf3s guardamos as palavras conosco. As imagens murcham, deformam-se, apagam-se.
