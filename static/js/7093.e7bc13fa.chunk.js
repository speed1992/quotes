I hope you live a life you\'re proud of and if you find that you\'re not, I hope you have the strength to start over.","She was beautiful, but not like those girls in the magazines. She was beautiful, for the way she thought. She was beautiful, for the sparkle in her eyes when she talked about something she loved. She was beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile, even if she was sad. No, she wasn\'t beautiful for something as temporary as her looks. She was beautiful, deep down to her soul. She is beautiful.","The world only exists in your eyes. You can make it as big or as small as you want","I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you\'re proud of. If you find that you\'re not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again.","And in the end, we were all just humans...Drunk on the idea that love, only love, could heal our brokenness.","You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest, and most beautiful person I have ever known\u2014and even that is an understatement.","Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat.","Suddenly she realized that what she was regretting was not the lost past but the lost future, not what had not been but what would never be.","...the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life, when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the \\"impossible,\\" come true.","Intelligence is measured by a person\'s ability to see validity within both sides of contradicting arguments.","You have a place in my heart no one else ever could have.","Before you criticize others, remember, they may not have had the same opportunities in life as you have had","There are all kinds of love in this world but never the same love twice.","It was only a sunny smile, and little it cost in the giving, but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living.","It is not merely enough to have the ability to be persistant, you must also have the ability to start over.","Too much of anything is bad, but too much Champagne is just right.","No matter how low you go, there\'s always an unexplored basement.","The greatest profound pain is cased by, and is the result of our own illusions, fantasies and dreams.","That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you\'re not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.","I never blame failure - there are too many complicated situations in life - but I am absolutely merciless toward lack of effort.","Either you think, or else others have to think for you and take power from you, pervert and discipline your natural tastes, civilize and sterilize you.","You are mysterious, I love you. You\u2019re beautiful, intelligent, and virtuous, and that\u2019s the rarest known combination.","He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.","Egyptian Proverb: The worst things: To be in bed and sleep not, To want for one who comes not, To try to please and please not.","Experience is the name so many people give to their mistakes.","Vitality shows in not only the ability to persist but the ability to start over.","Here\'s to alcohol, the rose colored glasses of life.","Never confuse activity with action.","I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity, and her flaming self respect.

I love her and it is the beginning of everything.","Having once found the intensity of art, nothing else that can happen in life can ever again seem as important as the creative process.","Her philosophy is carpe diem for herself and laissez faire for others.","The loneliest moment in someone\u2019s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.","Actually that\u2019s my secret \u2014 I can\u2019t even talk about you to anybody because I don\u2019t want any more people to know how wonderful you are.","Don\'t let yourself feel worthless: often through life you will really be at your worst when you seem to think best of yourself; and don\'t worry about losing your \\"personality,\\" as you persist in calling it: at fifteen you had the radiance of early morning, at twenty you will begin to have the melancholy brilliance of the moon, and when you are my age you will give out, as I do, the genial golden warmth of 4 p.m.","I don\u2019t want just words. If that\u2019s all you have for me, you\u2019d better go","good manners are an admission that everybody is so tender that they have to be handle with gloves.","Life is a comedy for those who think and a tragedy for those who feel. Show me a hero and I will write you a tragedy.","Courage to me means ploughing through that dull gray mist that comes down on life-not only overriding people and circumstances but overriding the bleakness of living. A sort of insistence on the value of life and the worth of transient things...My courage is faith-faith in the eternal resilience of me-that joy\'ll come back, and hope and spontaneity. And I feel that till it does, I\'ve got to keep my lips shut and my chin high, and my eyes wide","Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.","It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.","I love her and that\'s the beginning and end of everything.","Life is essentially a cheat and its conditions are those of defeat; the redeeming things are not happiness and pleasure but the deeper satisfactions that come out of struggle.","I want to tell you about your heart\u2014 you\'ve probably been neglecting your heart\u2014and you don\u2019t know.","I want to know you moved and breathed in the same world with me.","You see I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.","The ability to hold two competing thoughts in one\'s mind and still be able to function is the mark of a superior mind","Well, you never knew exactly how much space you occupied in people\'s lives.","Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.","One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise.","Don\'t forget who you are and where you come from.","It\'s not a slam at you when people are rude, it\'s a slam at the people they\'ve met before.","Things are sweeter when they\'re lost. I know--because once I wanted something and got it. It was the only thing I ever wanted badly, Dot, and when I got it it turned to dust in my hand.","I found something! Courage--just that; courage as a rule of life and something to cling to always.","For what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s never too late to be whoever you want to be.","Life is so damned hard, so damned hard... It just hurts people and hurts people, until finally it hurts them so that they can\'t be hurt ever any more. That\'s the last and worst thing it does.","Beautiful things grow to a certain height and then they fail and fade off, breathing out memories as they decay. And just as any period decays in our minds, the things of that period should decay too, and in that way they\'re preserved for a while in the few hearts like mine that react to them. Trying to preserve a century by keeping its relics up to date is like keeping a dying man alive by stimulants.","We all have souls of different ages","There\'s no substitute for will. Sometimes you have to fake will when you don\'t feel it at all.","The best of America drifts to Paris. The American in Paris is the best American. It is more fun for an intelligent person to live in an intelligent country. France has the only two things toward which we drift as we grow older\u2014intelligence and good manners.","Happiness is the relief after extreme tension","You\'re a slave, a bound helpless slave to one thing in the world, your imagination.","I didn\'t realize it, but the days came along one after another, and then two years were gone, and everything was gone, and I was gone.","The world, as a rule, does not live on beaches and in country clubs.","Of the things they possessed in common, greatest of all was their almost uncanny pull at each others hearts.","So we\'ll just let things take their course, and never be sorry.","The reason one writes isn\'t the fact he wants to say something. He writes because he has something to say.","A woman should be able to kiss a man beautifully and romantically without any desire to be either his wife or his mistress.","I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll do, but\u2014 well, I want to go places and see people. I want my mind to grow. I want to live where things happen on a big scale.","The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.","Some men have a necessity to be mean, as if they were exercising a faculty which they had to partially neglect since early childhood.","Tired, tired with nothing, tired with everything, tired with the world\u2019s weight he had never chosen to bear.","Once we were one person, and always it will be a little that way.","When I\'m with you, I don\'t breathe quite right.","She saw him the first day on board, and then her heart sank into her shoes as she realized at last how much she wanted him. No matter what his past was, no matter what he had done. Which was not to say that she would ever let him know, but only that he moved her chemically more than anyone she had ever met, that all other men seemed pale beside him.","You remind me of a smoked cigarette.","in crowded rooms they would form words with their lips for each other\'s eyes","She was dazzling-- alight; it was agony to comprehend her beauty in a glance.","I learned a little of beauty - enough to know that it had nothing to do with truth.","You seem to take things so personally, hating people and worshipping them--always thinking people are so important--especially yourselves.

She was-tremendously alive.","You really ought to read more books - you know, those things that look like blocks but come apart on one side.","She was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.","Someday I\'m going to find somebody and love him and love him and never let him go.","Think how you love me,\' she whispered. \'I don\'t ask you to love me always like this, but I ask you to remember.\' You\'ll always be like this to me.\' Oh no; but promise me you\'ll remember.\' Her tears were falling. \'I\'ll be different, but somewhere lost inside me there\'ll always be the person I am tonight.","I am tired of knowing nothing and being reminded of it all the time.","Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves. Even when they enter deep into our world or sink below us, they still think that they are better than we are. They are different.","i\'m a slave to my emotions, to my likes, to my hatred of boredom, to most of my desires","You are the loveliest thing that I have ever known.","They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered.","Was it the infinite sadness of her eyes that drew him or the mirror of himself that he found in the gorgeous clarity of her mind?","I\'m a cynical idealist.","She wanted to crawl into his pocket and be safe forever.","I was within and without. Simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.","Long ago, there was something in me, but now that thing is gone. Now that thing is gone, that thing is gone. I cannot cry. I cannot care. That thing will come back no more.","Don\'t say \'wife.\' I\'m your mistress. Wife\'s such an ugly word. Your \'permanent mistress\' is so much more tangible and desirable\u2026 .","Everybody\'s youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.","I\'m a romantic; a sentimental person thinks things will last, a romantic person hopes against hope that they won\'t.","I suppose books mean more than people to me anyway","Mostly, we authors must repeat ourselves - that\'s the truth. We have two or three great and moving experiences in our lives - experiences so great and moving that it doesn\'t seem at the time anyone else has been so caught up and so pounded and dazzled and astonished and beaten and broken and rescued and illuminated and rewarded and humbled in just that way ever before. Then we learn our trade, well or less well, and we tell our two or three stories - each time in a new disguise - maybe ten times, maybe a hundred, as long as people will listen.","To write it, it took three months; to conceive it three minutes; to collect the data in it all my life.","Celibacy goes deeper than the flesh.","So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.","First you take a drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes you.","Well, you never knew exactly how much space you occupied in people\'s lives. Yet from this fog his affection emerged--the best contacts are when one knows the obstacles and still wants to preserve a relation.","And I like large parties. They\u2019re so intimate. At small parties there isn\u2019t any privacy.","At eighteen our convictions are hills from which we look; at forty-five they are caves in which we hide.","It is in the thirties that we want friends. In the forties we know they won\'t save us any more than love did.","So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star.","Hard to sit here and be close to you, and not kiss you.","You\'ll find another.\' God! Banish the thought. Why don\'t you tell me that \'if the girl had been worth having she\'d have waited for you\'? No, sir, the girl really worth having won\'t wait for anybody.","His was a great sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours.","A love affair is like a short story--it has a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning was easy, the middle might drag, invaded by commonplace, but the end, instead of being decisive and well knit with that element of revelatory surprise as a well-written story should be, it usually dissipated in a succession of messy and humiliating anticlimaxes.","And that taught me you can\'t have anything, you can\'t have anything at all. Because desire just cheats you. It\'s like a sunbeam skipping here and there about a room. It stops and gilds some inconsequential object, and we poor fools try to grasp it - but when we do the sunbeam moves on to something else, and you\'ve got the inconsequential part, but the glitter that made you want it is gone.","\\"Oh, you want too much!\\" she cried to Gatsby. \\"I love you now - isn\'t that enough? I can\'t help what\'s past.\\" She began to sob helplessly. \\"I did love him once-but I loved you too.\\"\\nGatsby\'s eyes opened and closed.\\n\\"You loved me too?\\" he repeated.\\n\\"Even that\'s a lie,\\" said Tom savagely. \\"She didn\'t know you were alive. Why - there\'re things between Daisy and me that you\'ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.\\"","This is perhaps the best feeling in the world. I love going to sleep at night and wondering what weird and wonderful dreams I\'m going to have however I always prolong sleep as long as possible, immeasurably happy simply listening to the sound of my fiancees breathing and feeling his arms around me. It\'s when you fall in love with these little things that you know you\'re truly in love.","Can\u2019t repeat the past?\u2026Why of course you can!","I like France, where everybody thinks he\'s Napoleon--down here everybody thinks he\'s Christ.","There was a kindliness about intoxication - there was that indescribable gloss and glamour it gave, like the memories of ephemeral and faded evenings.","I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone\'s away. There\'s something very sensuous about it - overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.","She smiled at him, making sure that the smile gathered up everything inside her and directed it toward him, making him a profound promise of herself for so little, for the beat of a response, the assurance of a complimentary vibration in him.","God knows what you\'ve been doing, everything you\'ve been doing. You may fool me, but you can\'t fool God!","You will walk differently alone, dear, through a thicker atmosphere, forcing your way through the shadows of chairs, through the dripping smoke of the funnels. You will feel your own reflection sliding along the eyes of those who look at you. You are no longer insulated; but I suppose you must touch life in order to spring from it.","Life is progressive, no matter what our intentions.","Working-girls, in pairs and groups and swarms, loitered by these windows, choosing their future boudoirs from some resplendent display which included even a man\'s silk pajamas laid domestically across the bed. They stood in front of the jewelry stores and picked out their engagement rings, and their wedding rings and their platinum wrist watches, and then drifted on to inspect the feather fans and opera cloaks; meanwhile digesting the sandwiches and Sundaes they had eaten for lunch.","He had no plans, no definite intentions, except to kiss her lips again, to hold her in his arms.","There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.","Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.","Life cracked like ice!","What\'ll we do with ourselves this afternoon? And the day after that, and the next thirty years?","She was incomprehensible, for, in her, soul and spirit were one - the beauty of her body was the essence of her soul. She was that unity sought for by philosophers through many centuries. In this outdoor waiting room of winds and stars she had been sitting for a hundred years, at peace in the contemplation of herself.","He looked at her the way all women want to be looked at by a man.","What people are ashamed of usually makes a good story.","Whenever you feel like criticizing any one... just remember that all the people in this world haven\'t had the advantages that you\'ve had.","That familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.","I began to realize that for two years my life had been a drawing on resources that I did not possess, that I had been mortgaging myself physically and spiritually up to the hilt.","Beauty is only to be admired, only to be loved - to be harvested carefully and then flung at a chosen lover like a gift of roses. It seems to me, so far as I can judge clearly at all, that my beauty would be used like that.","The worst thing in the world is to try to sleep and not to.","Great books write themselves, only bad books have to be written.","In a real dark night of the soul, it is always three o\'clock in the morning, day after day.","She had an air of seeming to wait, as if for a man to get through with something more important than herself, a battle or an operation, during which he must not be hurried or interfered with. When the man had finished she would be waiting, without fret or impatience, somewhere on a highstool, turning the pages of a newspaper.","The kiss originated when the first male reptile licked the first female reptile, implying in a subtle way that she was as succulent as the small reptile he had for dinner the night before.","An author ought to write for the youth of his own generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolmaster of ever afterwards.","I shall go on shining as a brilliantly meaningless figure in a meaningless world.","Personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures.","It is sadder to find the past again and find it inadequate to the present than it is to have it elude you and remain forever a harmonious conception of memory.","I don\'t want to repeat my innocence. I want the pleasure of losing it again.","Draw your chair up close to the edge of the precipice and I\u2019ll tell you a story.","How different it all was from what you\'d planned.","Men get to be a mixture of the charming mannerisms of the women they have known.","To a profound pessimist about life, being in danger is not depressing.","Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead.","I hope she\'ll be a fool -- that\'s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.","I don\'t care about truth. I want some happiness.","Joan Crawford is doubtless the best example of the flapper, the girl you see in smart night clubs, gowned to the apex of sophistication, toying iced glasses with a remote, faintly bitter expression, dancing deliciously, laughing a great deal, with wide, hurt eyes. Young things with a talent for living.","At fifteen you had the radiance of early morning, at twenty you will begin to have the melancholy brilliance of the moon.","When a girl feels that she\u2019s perfectly groomed and dressed she can forget that part of her. That\u2019s charm","There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind.","This unlikely story begins on a sea that was a blue dream, as colorful as blue-silk stockings, and beneath a sky as blue as the irises of children\'s eyes.","The world is always curious, and people become valuable merely for their inaccessibility","The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain.","mother says that two souls are sometimes created together and--and in love before they\'re born.","I can\u2019t tell you just how wonderful she is. I don\u2019t want you to know. I don\u2019t want any one to know.","No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.","Boredom is not an end-product, is comparatively rather an early stage in life and art. You\'ve got to go by or past or through boredom, as through a filter, before the clear product emerges.","He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was.","Genius is the ability to put into effect what is on your mind.","I wasn\'t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.","She was a mischief, and that was a satisfaction; no longer was she a huntress of corralled game","Almost everybody can be imagined as either a cat or a dog.","I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart.","I want to die violently instead of fading out sentimentally.","It isn\'t given to us to know those rare moments when people are wide open and the lightest touch can wither or heal. A moment too late and we can never reach them any more in this world. They will not be cured by our most efficacious drugs or slain with our sharpest swords.","I\'m inclined to reserve all judgement, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.","Life was a damned muddle - a football game with everyone offside and the referee gotten rid of - everyone claiming the referee would have been on his side.","If you have anything to say, anything you feel nobody has ever said before, you have got to feel it so desperately that you will find some way to say it that nobody has ever found before, so that the thing you have to say and the way of saying it blend as one matter--as indissolubly as if they were conceived together.","You\'ve got to sell your heart, your strongest reactions, not the little minor things that only touch you lightly, the little experiences that you might tell at dinner. This is especially true when you begin to write, when you have not yet developed the tricks of interesting people on paper, when you have none of the technique which it takes time to learn. When, in short, you have only your emotions to sell.","Cut out all these exclamation points. An exclamation point is like laughing at your own joke.","Now he realized the truth: that sacrifice was no purchase of freedom. It was like a great elective office, it was like an inheritance of power - to certain people at certain times an essential luxury, carrying with it not a guarantee but a responsibility, not a security but an infinite risk. Its very momentum might drag him down to ruin - the passing of the emotional wave that made it possible might leave the one who made it high and dry forever on an island of despair...Sacrifice by its very nature was arrogant and impersonal; sacrifice should be eternally supercilious.","Her fine high forehead sloped gently up to where her hair, bordering it like an armorial shield, burst into lovelocks and waves and curlicues of ash blonde and gold. Her eyes were bright, big, clear, wet and shining, the colour of her cheeks was real, breaking close to the surface from the strong young pump of her heart. Her body hovered delicately on the last edge of childhood -- she was almost eighteen, nearly complete, but the dew was still on her.","You\'re not sorry to go, of course. With people like us our home is where we are not... No one person in the world is necessary to you or to me.","Poetry is either something that lives like fire inside you -- like music to the musician or Marxism to the Communist -- or else it is nothing, an empty, formalized bore around which pedants can endlessly drone their notes and explanations.","Ernest [Hemmingway] was always ready to lend a helping hand to the one on the rung above him.","The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alivewith chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other\u2019s names.","Show me a hero and I\'ll write you a tragedy.","I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.","It\u2019s a great advantage not to drink among hard drinking people.","the cracked plate has to be retained in the pantry, has to be kept in service as a household necessity. It can never be warmed on the stove nor shuffled with the other plates in the dishpan; it will not be brought out for company but it will do to hold crackers late at night or to go into the ice-box with the left overs.","You can stroke people with words.","Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that\'s no matter - to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther ... And one fine morning ---","This is what I think now: that the natural state of the sentient adult is a qualified unhappiness.","I am too much a moralist at heart, and really want to preach at people in some acceptable form, rather than entertain them.","Never miss a party...good for the nerves--like celery.","The sign of intelligence is the ability to carry opposed thoughts at the same time.","Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time. - The Great Gatsby.","One thin\'s sure and nothing\'s surer The rich get richer and the poor get - children. In the meantime, In between time...","People invariably chose inimitable people to imitate.","My latest tendency is to collapse about 11:00 and with the tears flowing from my eyes or the gin rising to their level and leaking over, and tell interested friends or acquaintances that I haven\'t a friend in the world and likewise care for nobody.","I talk with the authority of failure - Ernest with the authority of success. We could never sit across the same table again.","Nobody ever became a writer just by wanting to be one.","It takes two to make an accident.","It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.","Family quarrels are bitter things. They don\'t go according to any rules. They\'re not like aches or wounds, they\'re more like splits in the skin that won\'t heal because there\'s not enough material.","Work like hell! I had 122 rejection slips before I sold a story.","I simply state that I\'m a product of a versatile mind in a restless generation - with every reason to throw my mind and pen in with the radicals. Even if, deep in my heart, I thought we were all blind atoms in a world as limited as a stroke of a pendulum, I and my sort would struggle against tradition; try, at least, to displace old cants with new ones. I\'ve thought I was right about life at various times, but faith is difficult. One thing I know. If living isn\'t seeking for the grail it may be a damned amusing game.","His youth seemed never so vanished as now in the contrast between the utter loneliness of this visit and that riotous, joyful party of four years before. Things that had been the merest commonplaces of his life then, deep sleep, the sense of beauty around him, all desire, had flown away and the gaps they left were filled only with the great listlessness of his disillusion.","Action is character.","The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God\u2014a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that\u2014and he must be about His Father\u2019s Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty.","Premature success gives one an almost mystical conception of destiny as opposed to will power-at its worst the Napoleonic delusion.","If I knew words enough, I could write the longest love letter in the world and never get tired","Even when everything seems rotten you can\'t trust that judgment. It\'s the sum of all your judgments that counts.","She wanted to exist only as a conscious flower, prolonging and preserving herself","Once one is caught up into the material world not one person in ten thousand finds the time to form literary taste, to examine the validity of philosophic concepts for himself, or to form what, for lack of a better phrase, I might call the wise and tragic sense of life.","He must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about...like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.","He did not understand all he had heard, but from his clandestine glimpse into the privacy of these two, with all the world that his short experience could conceive of at their feet, he had gathered that life for everybody was a struggle, sometimes magnificent from a distance, but always difficult and surprisingly simple and a little sad.","In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.","Sometimes I don\'t know whether I\'m real or whether I\'m a character in one of my novels.","When a man is tired of life on his 21st birthday it indicates that he is rather tired of something in himself.","Conditions in the [movie] industry somehow propose the paradox: \\"We brought you here for your individuality but while you\'re here we insist that you do everything to conceal it.","A big man has no time really to do anything but just sit and be big.","The rhythm of the weekend, with its birth, its planned gaiety, and its announced end, followed the rhythm of life and was a substitute for it.","The rich are different from us.","Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.","I hate dainty minds,\' answered Marjorie. \'But a girl has to be dainty in person. If she looks like a million dollars she can talk about Russia, ping-pong, or the League of Nations and get away with it.","Intermittently she caught the gist of his sentences and supplied the rest from her subconscious, as one picks up the striking of a clock in the middle with only the rhythm of the first uncounted strokes lingering in the mind.","Do you ever wait for the longest day of the year and then miss it?

Or three but that had never stopped me from loving you.","A man\'s social rank is determined by the amount of bread he eats in a sandwich.","Most people think everybody feels about them much more violently than they actually do; they think other people\'s opinions of them swing through great arcs of approval or disapproval.","My generation of radicals and breakers-down never found anything to take the place of the old virtues of work and courage and the old graces of courtesy and politeness.","The truth was that for some months he had been going through that partitioning of the things of youth wherein it is decided whether or not to die for what one no longer believes.","The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun.","Dear, don\'t think of getting out of bed yet.

I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn\u2019t be over-dreamed \u2014that voice was a deathless song.","It is not life that\'s complicated, it\'s the struggle to guide and control life.","the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.","I had a strong sudden instinct that I must be alone. I didn\u2019t want to see any people at all. I had seen so many people all my life -- I was an average mixer, but more than average in a tendency to identify myself, my ideas, my destiny, with those of all classes that came in contact with.

I lived in a world of inscrutable hostiles and inalienable friends and supporters.","It is in the twenties that the actual momentum of life begins to slacken, and it is a simple soul indeed to whom as many things are as significant and meaningful at thirty as at ten years before. At thirty an organ-grinder is a more or less a moth eaten man who grinds an organ - and once he was an organ-grinder! The unmistakable stigma of humanity touches all those impersonal and beautiful things that only youth ever grasps in their impersonal glory.","Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.","I couldn\u2019t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified.

Maybe because the condition of emptiness is too shameful to be divulged.","Art isn\'t meaningless... It is in itself. It isn\'t in that it tries to make life less so.","Great art is the contempt of a great man for small art.","She wouldn\'t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.","Rosemary felt that this swim would become the typical one of her life, the one that would always pop up in her memory at the mention of swimming.","Character is plot, plot is character.","They always believe that \'things are in a bad way now,\' but they \'haven\'t any faith in these idealists.\' One minute they call Wilson \'just a dreamer, not practical\'- a year later they rail at him for making his dreams realities.

The future vista of her life seemed an unending succession of scenes like this: under moonlight and pale starlight, and in the backs of warm limousines and in low cosy roadsters stopped under sheltering trees-only the boy might change, and this one was so nice.","We all must try to be good.","An unread book is just a block of paper.","The helpless ecstasy of loosing himself in her charm was a powerful opiate rather than a tonic.","taking her hand he led her out into a broad stretch of hard sandy soil that the moon flooded with great splendor. They floated out like drifting moths under the rich hazy light, and as the fantastic symphony wept and exulted and wavered and despaired, Ardita\'s last sense of reality dropped away, and she abandonded her imagination to the dreamy summer scents of tropial flowers and the infinite starry spaces overhead, feeling that if she opened her eyes it would be to find herself dancing with a ghost in a land created by her own fantasy.","He was so terrible that he was no longer terrible, only dehumanized.","There\'s a right way of doing things and a wrong way.

A little less rationalize, comment, talk.","I never noticed the stars before. I always thought of them as great big diamonds that belonged to some one. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream, all my youth.","Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money.

He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips\u2019 touch she blossomed like a flower and the incarnation was complete.","It\'s all life is. Just going \'round kissing people.","Experience is not worth the getting.

There is another sort of blow that comes from within-that you don\'t feel until it\'s too late to do anything about it, until you realize with finality that in some regard you will never be as good a man again.","Given a decent start any girl can beat a man nowadays.","Nothing is as obnoxious as other people\'s luck.","Then she added in a sort of childish delight: \'We\'ll be poor, won\'t we?

Self-expression had never seemed at once so desirable and so impossible.","Trouble has no necessary connection with discouragement. Discouragement has a germ of its own, as different from trouble as arthritis is different from a stiff joint.","These lights, this brightness, these clusters of human hope, of wild desire\u2014I shall take these lights in my fingers. I shall make them bright, and whether they shine or not, it is in these fingers that they shall succeed or fail.","It makes me sad because I\'ve never seen such--such beautiful shirts before.","An artist is someone who can hold two opposing viewpoints and still remain fully functional.","First, he realized that the sea was blue and that there was an enormous quantity of it, and that it roared and roared-really all the banalities about the ocean that one could realize, but if any one had told him then that these things were banalities, he would have gaped in wonder.","Then a strange thing happened. She turned to him and smiled, and as he saw her smile every rag of anger and hurt vanity dropped from him \u2014 as though his very moods were but the outer ripples of her own, as though emotion rose no longer in his breast unless she saw fit to pull an omnipotent controlling thread.","I wish I could write. I get these ideas but I never seem to be able to put them in words.","I can\u2019t exactly describe how I feel but it\u2019s not quite right.

And while I like writers\u2014because if you ask a writer anything you usually get an answer\u2014still it belittled him in my eyes. Writers aren\u2019t people exactly. Or, if they\u2019re any good, they\u2019re a whole lot of people trying so hard to be one person. It\u2019s like actors, who try so pathetically not to look in mirrors. Who lean backward trying\u2014only to see their faces in the reflecting chandeliers.","And lastly from that period I remember riding in a taxi one afternoon between very tall buildings under a mauve and rosy sky; I began to bawl because I had everything I wanted and knew I would never be so happy again.","Strange children should smile at each other and say, \\"Let\'s play.","New York had all the iridescence of the beginning of the world. The returning troops marched up Fifth Avenue and girls were instinctively drawn East and North toward them - this was the greatest nation and there was gala in the air.","Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home.","Every act of life, from the morning toothbrush to the friend at dinner, became an effort. I hated the night when I couldn\'t sleep and I hated the day because it went toward night.","There are no second acts in American lives.","Any person with any imagination is bound to be afraid.","The idea that to make a man work you\'ve got to hold gold in front of his eyes is a growth, not an axiom. We\'ve done that for so long that we\'ve forgotten there\'s any other way.","Beware the artist who\'s an intellectual also. The artist who doesn\'t fit.","Grown up, and that is a terribly hard thing to do. It is much easier to skip it and go from one childhood to another.","Your life on earth will be, as always, the interval between two significant glances in a mundane mirror.","To have something to say is a question of sleepless nights and worry and endless ratiocination of subject - of endless trying to dig out the essential truth, the essential justice. As a first premise you have to develop a conscience and if on top of that you have talent so much the better. But if you have talent without the conscience, you are just one of many thousands of journalists.","For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy\'s wing.","At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That\'s a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion.","he used to think that he wanted to be good, he wanted to be kind, he wanted to be brave and wise, but it was all pretty difficult. He wanted to be loved, too, if he could fit it in.","I\'ve given parties that have made Indian rajahs green with envy. I\'ve had prima donnas break $10,000 engagements to come to my smallest dinners. When you were still playing button back in Ohio, I entertained on a cruising trip that was so much fun that I had to sink my yacht to make my guests go home.","That however the brains and abilities of men may differ, their stomachs are essentially the same.","The invitation to Miss Myra St. Claire\'s bobbing party spent the morning in his coat pocket, where it had an intense physical affair with a dusty piece of peanut brittle.","Nothing any good isn\'t hard.","She smiled, a moving childish smile that was like all the lost youth in the world.","So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight - watching over nothing.","Writers aren\u2019t people exactly. Or, if they\u2019re any good, they\u2019re a whole lot of people trying so hard to be one person.","I\'ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.","She was overstrained with grief and loneliness: almost any shoulder would have done as well.","Never befuddle a solitary thrashing with a last annihilation.","No grand idea was ever born in a conference, but a lot of foolish ideas have died there.","America is a willingness of the heart.","\\"If it wasn\u2019t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,\\" said Gatsby. \\"You always have a green light that burns at the end of your dock.\\" Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to him, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted things had diminished by one.","All I kept thinking about, over and over, was \'You can\'t live forever; you can\'t live forever.","Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her; If you can bounce high, bounce for her too, Till she cry \\"Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover, I must have you!","A classic,\' suggested Anthony, \'is a successful book that has survived the reaction of the next period or generation.

The new love-words, the tenderness learned, and treasured up for the next lover.","If he had to bring all the bitterness and hatred of the world into his heart, he was not going to be in love with her again.","No such thing as a man willing to be honest - that would be like a blind man willing to see.","If you are strong enough, there are no precedents.","How strange to have failed as a social creature\u2014even criminals do not fail that way\u2014they are the law\'s \\"Loyal Opposition,\\" so to speak.

It was a day easily associated with those abstract truths and purities that dissolve in the sunshine or fade out in mocking laughter by the light of the moon. The trees and clouds were carved in classical severity; the sounds of the countryside had harmonized to a monotone, metallic as a trumpet, breathless as the Grecian urn.","Reporting the extreme things as if they were the average things will start you on the art of fiction.","he was figuratively following along beside her as she walked the fence, ready to catch her if she should fall.","Baseball is a game played by idiots for morons.","Often people display a curious respect for a man drunk, rather like the respect of simple races for the insane... There is something awe-inspiring in one who has lost all inhibitions.","They were stars on this stage, each playing to an audience of two: the passion of their pretense created the actuality. Here, finally, was the quintessence of self-expression-- yet it was probable that for the most part their love expressed Gloria rather than Anthony. He felt often like a scarecly tolerated guest at a party she was giving.","It was too late - everything was too late. For years now he had dreamed the world away, basing his decisions upon emotions unstable as water.","Genius goes around the world in its youth incessantly apologizing for having large feet. What wonder that later in life it should be inclined to raise those feet too swiftly to fools and bores.","We can\'t possibly have a summer love. So many people have tried that the name\'s become proverbial. Summer is only the unfulfilled promise of spring, a charlatan in place of the warm balmy nights I dream of in April. It\'s a sad season of life without growth...It has no day.","Nancy had a mouth like a remembered kiss.","All she wanted was to be a little girl, to be efficiently taken care of by some yielding yet superior power, stupider and steadier than herself. It seemed that the only lover she had ever wanted was a lover in a dream","Talk English to me, Tommy. Parlez francais avec moi, Nicole. But the meanings are different-- in French you can be heroic and gallant with dignity, and you know it. But in English you can\'t be heroic and gallant without being a little absurd, and you know that too. That gives me an advantage.","When people are taken out of their depths they lose their heads, no matter how charming a bluff they may put up.","But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.","When he buys his ties he has to ask if gin will make them run.","Even when the east excited me most, even when I was keenly aware of its superiority to the broad, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which only spared children and the very old-even then it had always for me a quality of distortion.","There was one of his lonelinesses coming, one of those times when he walked the streets or sat, aimless and depressed, biting a pencil at his desk. It was a self-absorption with no comfort, a demand for expression with no outlet, a sense of time rushing by, ceaselessly and wastefully - assuaged only by that conviction that there was nothing to waste, because all efforts and attainments were equally valueless.","The failure and the success both believe in their hearts that they have accurately balanced points of view, the success because he\'s succeeded, and the failure because he\'s failed. The successful man tells his son to profit by his father\'s good fortune, and the failure tells his son to profit by his father\'s mistakes.","i\'m in a muddle about a lot of things -- i\'ve just discovered that i\'ve a mind, and i\'m starting to read\\" \\"read what?\\" \\"everything. i have to pick and choose, of course, but mostly things that make me think.","That was always my experience-a poor boy in a rich town; a poor boy in a rich boy\'s school; a poor boy in a rich man\'s club at Princeton .... However, I have never been able to forgive the rich for being rich, and it has colored my entire life and works.","In a few days I\'ll have lived one score and three days in this vale of tears. On I plod-always bored, often drunk, doing no penance for my faults-rather do I become more tolerant of myself from day to day, hardening my crystal heart with blasphemous humor and shunning only toothpicks, pathos, and poverty as being the three unforgivable things in life.","Very few of the people who accentuate the futility of life remark the futility of themselves. Perhaps they think that in proclaiming the evil of living they somehow salvage their own worth from the ruin - but they don\'t, even you and I.","I\'m one of those people who go through the world giving other people thrills, but getting few myself except those I read into men on such nights as these.

However, I\'m only eighteen.","The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.","His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him.","Looking back over a decade one sees the ideal of a university become a myth, a vision, a meadow lark among the smoke stacks. Yet perhaps it is there at Princeton, only more elusive than under the skies of the Prussian Rhineland or Oxfordshire; or perhaps some men come upon it suddenly and possess it, while others wander forever outside. Even these seek in vain through middle age for any corner of the republic that preserves so much of what is fair, gracious, charming and honorable in American life.","Every author ought to write every book as if he were going to be beheaded the day he finished it.","Once I thought that Lake Forest was the most glamorous place in the world. Maybe it was.","The years between thirty-five and sixty-five revolve before the passive mind as one unexplained, confusing merry-go-round. True, they are a merry-go-round of ill-gaited and wind-broken horses, painted first in pastel colors, then in dull grays and browns, but perplexing and intolerably dizzy the thing is, as never were the merry-go-rounds of childhood or adolescence; as never, surely, were the certain-coursed, dynamic roller-coasters of youth. For most men and women these thirty years are taken up with a gradual withdrawal from life.","Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just, And this be our motto: \\"In God is our trust.\\" And the star-spangled banner forever shall wave O\'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!","What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?","Sometimes I think that idlers seem to be a special class for whom nothing can be planned, plead as one will with them - their only contribution to the human family is to warm a seat at the common table.","Here was a new generation, shouting the old cries, learning the old creeds, through a revery of long days and nights; destined finally to go out into that dirty gray turmoil to follow love and pride; a new generation dedicated more than the last to the fear of poverty and the worship of success; grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken.","From the ruins, lonely and inexplicable as the sphinx, rose the Empire State Building.","I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.","He had possessed the arrogance of a tall member of a short race, with no obligation save to be tall.","I\'m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.","...I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.","I don\'t think he was ever happy unless someone was in love with him, responding to him like filings to a magnet, helping him to explain himself, promising him something. What it was I do not know. Perhaps they promised that there would always be women in the world who would spend their brightest, freshest, rarest hours to nurse and protect that superiority he cherished in his heart.","The hangover became a part of the day as well allowed-for as the Spanish siesta.","Prose talent depends on having something to say and an interesting, highly developed way of saying it.","The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.","When she saw him face to face their eyes met and brushed like birds\u2019 wings. After that everything was all right, everything was wonderful, she knew that he was beginning to fall in love with her.","Amory wondered how people could fail to notice that he was a boy marked for glory, and when faces of the throng turned toward him and ambiguous eyes stared into his, he assumed the most romantic of expressions and walked on the air cushions that lie on the asphalts of fourteen.","France was a land, England was a people, but America, having about it still that quality of the idea, was harder to utter - it was the graves at Shiloh and the tired, drawn, nervous faces of its great men, and the country boys dying in the Argonne for a phrase that was empty before their bodies withered. It was a willingness of the heart.","No one should live beyond 30.","Of all natural forces, vitality is the incommunicable one. . . . Vitality never \\"takes.\\" You have it or you haven\'t it, like health or brown eyes or a baritone voice.","A writer\'s temperament is continually making him do things he can never repair.","As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat\'s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.","For years afterwards when Amory thought of Eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart. The night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds, he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore; and when he lost it he lost also the power of regretting it.","Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on.","It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.","He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.","To most women art is a form of scandal.","The extraordinary thing is not that people in a lifetime turn out worse or better than we had prophesied; particularly in America that is to be expected. The extraordinary thing is how people keep their levels, fulfill their promises, seem actually buoyed up by an inevitable destiny.","You can take Hollywood for granted like I did, or you can dismiss it with the contempt we reserve for what we don\'t understand. It can be understood too, but only dimly and in flashes. Not half a dozen men have ever been able to keep the whole equation of pictures in their heads.","Then I grew up, and the beauty of succulent illusions fell away from me.","You\'re a rotten driver,\' I protested. \'Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtn\'t to drive at all.\' \'I am careful.\' \'No, you\'re not.\' \'Well, other people are,\' she said lightly. \'What\'s that got to do with it?\' \'They\'ll keep out of my way,\' she insisted. \'It takes two to make an accident.\' \'Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\' \'I hope I never will,\' she answered. \'I hate careless people. That\'s why I like you.\' Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her.","One writes of scars healed, a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin, but there is no such thing in the life of an individual.","What\'ll we do with ourselves this afternoon,\' cried Daisy, \'and the day after that, and the next thirty years?\' \'Don\'t be morbid,\' Jordan said. \'Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.\' \'But it\'s so hot,\' insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, \'And everything\'s so confused. Let\'s all go to town!","But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot.","I care not who hoes the lettuce of my country if I can eat the salad!","I am not a great man, but sometimes I think the impersonal and objective equality of my talent and the sacrifices of it, in pieces, to preserve its essential value has some sort of epic grandeur.","The early twenties when we drank wood alcohol and every day in every way grew better and better, and there was a first abortive shortening of the skirts, and girls all looked alike in sweater dresses, and people you didn\'t want to know said \\"Yes, we have no bananas,\\" and it seemed only a question of a few years before the older people would step aside and let the world be run by those who saw things as they were--and it all seems rosy and romantic to us who were young then, because we will never feel quite so intensely about our surroundings any more.","One girl can be pretty - but a dozen are only a chorus.","Shakespeare--whetting, frustrating, surprising and gratifying.","But I always felt that I\'d rather be provincial hot-tamale than soup without seasoning.","Baltimore is warm but pleasant... I belong here, where everything is civilized and gay and rotted and polite.","...for a moment people set down their glasses in county clubs and speak-easies and thought of their old best dreams.","All things come to him who mates.","I have asked a lot of my emotions-one hundred and twenty stories. The price was high, right up with Kipling, because there was one little drop of something, not blood, not a tear, not my seed, but me more intimately than these, in every story, it was the extra I had. Now it has gone and I am just like you now.","No decent career was ever founded on a public.","There\'s so much spring in the air- there\'s so much lazy sweetness in your heart.","The only way to increase it is to cultivate your own garden. And the only thing that will help you is poetry, which is the most concentrated form of style.... I don\'t care how clever the other professor is, one can\'t raise a discussion of modern prose to anything above tea-table level.","This is the beauty I want. Beauty has got to be astonishing, astounding-- it\'s got to burst in on you like a dream, like the exquisite eyes of a girl.","Lie to me by the moonlight. Do a fabulous story.","It\'s a mining town in lotus land.","Progress was a labyrinth ... people plunging blindly in and then rushing wildly back, shouting that they had found it ... the invisible king-the \xe9lan vital-the principle of evolution ... writing a book, starting a war, founding a school.","The past--the wild charge at the head of his men up San Juan Hill; the first years of his marriage when he worked late into the summer dusk down in the busy city for young Hildegarde whom he loved; the days before that when he sat smoking far into the night in the gloomy old Button house on Monroe Street with his grandfather-all these had faded like unsubstantial dreams from his mind as though they had never been. He did not remember.","I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye.","Somewhere inside me there\u2019ll always be the person I am to-night","Aristocracy\'s only an admission that certain traits which we call fine - courage and honor and beauty and all that sort of thing - can best be developed in a favorable environment, where you don\'t have the warpings of ignorance and necessity.","He found himself remembering how on one summer morning they two had started from New York in search of happiness. They had never expected to find it, perhaps, yet in itself that quest had been happier than anything he expected forevermore. Life, it seemed, must be a setting up of props around one - otherwise it was disaster. There was no rest, no quiet. He had been futile in longing to drift and dream, no one drifted except to maelstroms, no one dreamed, without his dreams becoming fantastic nightmares of indecision and regret.","There was no God in his heart, he knew; his ideas were still in riot; there was ever the pain of memory; the regret for his lost youth-yet the waters of disillusion had left a deposit on his soul, responsibility and a love of life, the faint stirring of old ambitions and unrealized dreams...... And he could not tell why the struggle was worth while, why he had determined to use to the utmost himself and his heritage from the personalities he had passed... He stretched out his arms to the crystalline, radiant sky. I know myself,\\" he cried, \\"but that is all.","I\'m not much like myself any more.","No one person in the world is necessary to you or to me.","Exploration was for those with a measure of peasant blood, those with big thighs and thick ankles who could take punishment as they took bread and salt, on every inch of flesh and spirit.","I thought of Gatsby\'s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy\'s dock. He had come a long way to this lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him. [- Nick Carroway]","I was rather literary in college\u2014one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the \'Yale News.\'\u2014and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the \'well-rounded man.\' This isn\u2019t just an epigram\u2014life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.","No,\\" interrupted Marcia emphatically. \\"And you\'re a sweet boy. Come here and kiss me.\\" Horace stopped quickly in front of her. \\"Why do you want me to kiss you?\\" he asked intently. \\"Do you just go round kissing people?\\" \\"Why, yes,\\" admitted Marcia, unruffled. \\"\'At\'s all life is. Just going around kissing people.","She was incurably dishonest.","This unlikely story begins on a sea that was a blue dream, as colorful as blue-silk stockings, and beneath a sky as blue as the irises of children\'s eyes. From the western half of the sky the sun was shying little golden disks at the sea--if you gazed intently enough you could see them skip from wave tip to wave tip until they joined a broad collar of golden coin that was collecting half a mile out and would eventually be a dazzling sunset.","What you have felt and thought will by itself invent a new style, so that when people talk about style they are always a little astonished at the newness of it, because they think that it is only style that they are talking about, when what they are talking about is the attempt to express a new idea with such force that it will have the originality of the thought.It is an awfully lonesome business, and, as you know, I never wanted you to go into it, but if you are going into it at all, I want you to go into it knowing the sort of things that took me years to learn.","Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour.","Then he kissed her. At his lips\' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.","...one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.","I guess I\'m the Black Death,\' he said slowly. \'I don\'t seem to bring people happiness any more.","It\'s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be.","They were smiling at each other as if this was the beginning of the world.","After all, life hasn\'t much to offer except youth, and I suppose for older people, the love of youth in others.","That\'s the whole burden of this novel - the loss of those illusions that give such color to the world that you don\'t care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory.","A sense of the fundamental decencies is parceled out unequally at birth.","The men--the undergraduates of Yale and Princeton are cleaner, healthier, better-looking, better dressed, wealthier and more attractive than any undergraduate body in the country.","Never walk near the bed; to a ghost your ankle is your most vulnerable part-once in bed, you\'re safe; he may lie around under the bed all night, but you\'re safe as daylight. If you still have doubts pull the blanket over your head.","Modern life... changes no longer century by century, but year by year, ten times faster than it ever has before-populations doubling, civilizations unified more closely with other civilizations, economic interdependence, racial questions, and-we\'re dawdling along. My idea is that we\'ve got to go very much faster.","The history of my life is the history of the struggle between an overwhelming urge to write and a combination of circumstances bent on keeping me from it.","The best of America drifts to Paris. The American in Paris is the best American.","Rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks. Her naivete responded whole-heartedly to the expensive simplicity of the Divers, unaware of its complexity and its lack of innocence, unaware that it was all a selection of quality rather than quantity from the run of the world\'s bazaar; and that the simplicity of behavior also, the nursery-like peace and good will, the emphasis on the simpler virtues, was part of a desperate bargain with the gods and had been attained through struggles she could not have guessed at.","Women are necessarily capable of almost anything in their struggle for survival and can scarcely be convicted of such man-made crimes as \u201ccruelty.","For the moment I can only cry out that I have lost my splendid mirage. Come back, come back, O glittering and white!","Feel like criticizing any one,\\" he told me, \\"just remember","The cleverly expressed opposite of any generally accepted idea is worth a fortune to somebody.","The Montana sunset lay between the mountains like a giant bruise from which darkened arteries spread across a poisoned sky.","I was haunted always by my other life-my drab room in the Bronx, my square foot of the subway, my fixation upon the day\'s letter from Alabama-would it come and what would it say?-my shabby suits, my poverty, and love. While my friends were launching decently into life I had muscled my inadequate bark into midstream... I was a failure-mediocre at advertising work and unable to get started as a writer. Hating the city, I got roaring, weeping drunk on my last penny and went home.","Ah,\\" she cried, \\"you look so cool.\\" Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table. You always look so cool,\\" she repeated. She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.","Amory took to writing poetry on spring afternoons, in the gardens of the big estates near Princeton, while swans made effective atmosphere in the artificial pools, and slow clouds sailed harmoniously above the willow. May came too soon, and suddenly unable to bear walls, he wandered the campus at all hours through starlight and rain.","As he took her hand she saw him look her over from head to foot, a gesture she recognized and that made her feel at home, but gave her always a faint feeling of superiority to whoever made it. If her person was property she could exercise whatever advantage was inherent in its ownership.","Englishmen must have an island.","Once a change of direction has begun, even though it\'s the wrong one, it still tends to clothe itself as thoroughly in the appurtenances of Tightness as if it had been a natural all along.","I\'m restless. My whole generation is restless. I\'m sick of a system where the richest man gets the most beautiful girl if he wants her, where the artist without an income has to sell his talents to a button manufacturer. Even if I had no talents I\'d not be content to work ten years, condemned either to celibacy or a furtive indulgence, to give some man\'s son an automobile.","It is difficult for young people to live things down. We will tolerate vice, grand larceny and the quieter forms of murder in our contemporaries... but our children\'s friends must show a blank service record.","Most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don\'t in the beginning.","There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams -- not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.","Understand now, I\'m purely a fiction writer and do not profess to be an earnest student of political science, but I believe strongly that such a law as one prohibiting liquor is foolish, and all the writers, keenly interested in human welfare whom I know, laugh at the prohibition law.","She felt a little betrayed and sad, but presently a moving object came into sight. It was a huge horse-chestnut tree in full bloom bound for the Champs Elysees, strapped now into a long truck and simply shaking with laughter - like a lovely person in an undignified position yet confident none the less of being lovely. Looking at it with fascination, Rosemary identified herself with it, and laughed cheerfully with it, and everything all at once seemed gorgeous.","Let\'s borrow life preservers and jump over. I think we should do something spectacular. I feel that all our lives have been too restrained.","Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word.","There has never been an American tragedy. There have only been great failures.","I want to give a really BAD party. I mean it. I want to give a party where there\u2019s a brawl and seductions and people going home with their feelings hurt and women passed out in the cabinet de toilette. You wait and see.","And will I like being called a jazz-baby?\\nYou will love it.","It was about then [1920] that I wrote a line which certain people will not let me forget: \\"She was a faded but still lovely woman of twenty-seven.\\"","Travel, which had once charmed him, seemed, at length, unendurable, a business of color without substance, a phantom chase after his own dream\'s shadow.","It was strange to have no self-to be like a little boy left alone in a big house, who knew that now he could do anything he wanted to do, but found that there was nothing that he wanted to do.","I have lived hard and ruined the essential innocence [sic] in myself that could make it that possible [sic], and the fact that I have abused liquor is something to be paid for with suffering and death perhaps but not renunciation.","Isn\'t Hollywood a dump-in the human sense of the word. A hideous town, pointed up by the insulting gardens of its rich, full of the human spirit at a new low of debasement.","Debut: the first time a young girl is seen drunk in public.","The things that\'ll make you fail I\'ll love always.","Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply.","You don\u2019t know what a trial it is to be \u2014like me. I\'ve got to keep my face like steel in the street to keep men from winking at me.","She laughed with thrilling scorn. \\"Sophisticated-God, I\'m sophisticated!","It\'s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue, and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don\'t see or care.","We want to believe. Young students try to believe in older authors, constituents try to believe in their Congressmen, countries try to believe in their statesmen, but they can\'t. Too many voices, too much scattered, illogical ill-considered criticism.","I love this simply because it\'s cute, and I guess it\'s a sign of the times in many respect. It\'s pretty much saying you complete me, only in the sweetest way possible.","For a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.","In short, you have only your emotions to sell. This is the experience of all writers.","He felt married to her, that was all.","I know myself,\\" he cried, \\"but that is all-","Tireless passion, fierce jealousy, longing to possess and crush-these alone were left of all his love for Rosalind; these remained to him as payment for the loss of his youth-bitter calomel under the thin sugar of love\'s exaltation.","I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others--young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.","They\'re a rotten crowd\', I shouted across the lawn. \'You\'re worth the whole damn bunch put together.","\\"I was counting the waves\\", replied Amory gravely, \\"I\'m going in for statistics\\".","If you try to create a type, you may end with nothing. If you do a good job of creating an individual, you may succeed at creating a type.","I\'ve got an adjective that just fits you.","He snatched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his burred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.","Those days are over. I have to be won all over again every time you see me.","So they were desperately in love and being desperately in love involves a desperate existence.","When Vanity kissed Vanity, a hundred happy Junes ago, he pondered o\'er her breathlessly, and, that all men might ever know, he rhymed her eyes with life and death: \\"Thru Time I\'ll save my love!\\" he said. . . yet Beauty vanished with his breath, and, with her lovers, she was dead. . . -Ever his wit and not her eyes, ever his art and not her hair: \\"Who\'d learn a trick in rhyme, be wise and pause before his sonnet there\\". . . So all my words, however true, might sing you to a thousandth June, and no one ever know that you were Beauty for an afternoon.","A writer like me must have an utter confidence, an utter faith in his star. It\'s an almost mystical feeling, a feeling of nothing-can-happen-to me, nothing-can-touch-me.... I once had it. But through a series of blows, many of them my own fault, something happened to that sense of immunity and I lost my grip.","Her beautiful eyes and lips were very grave as she made her choice, and Anthony thought again how naive was her every gesture; she took all the things of life for hers to choose from and apportion, as though she were continually picking out presents for herself from an inexhaustible counter.","I was in love with a whirlwind, so when the girl threw me over, I went home and finished my novel.","Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me.","Who would not be pleased at carrying lamps helpfully through the darkness?","Writing is eternal, For therein the dead heart liveth, the clay-cold tongue is eloquent, And the quick eye of the reader is cleared by the reed of the scribe. As a fossil in the rock, or a coin in the mortar of a ruin, So the symbolled thoughts tell of a departed soul: The plastic hand hath its witness in a statue, and exactitude of vision in a picture, And so, the mind, that was among us, in its writings is embalmed.","People try so hard to believe in leaders now, pitifully hard. But we no sooner get a popular reformer or politician or soldier or writer or philosopher -- a Roosevelt, a Tolstoi, a Wood, a Shaw, a Nietzsche, than the cross-currents of criticism wash him away. My Lord, no man can stand prominence these days. It\'s the surest path to obscurity. People get sick of hearing the same name over and over.","Men she knew\'? - she had conceded vaguely to herself that all men who had ever been in love with her were her friends.","I\'ve noticed that the children of other nations always seem precocious. That\'s because the strange manners of their elders have caught our attention most and the children echo those manners enough to seem like their parents.","Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something-an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man\'s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.","Her body calculated to a millimeter to suggest a bud yet guarantee a flower.","Happiness, remarked Maury Noble one day, is only the first hour after the alleviation of some especially intense misery.","There used to be two kinds of kisses: First when girls were kissed and deserted; second, when they were engaged. Now there\'s a third kind, where the man is kissed and deserted. If Mr. Jones of the nineties bragged he\'d kissed a girl, everyone knew he was through with her. If Mr. Jones of 1919 brags the same, everyone knows it\'s because he can\'t kiss her any more. Given a decent start any girl can beat a man nowadays.","You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn\'t I? I mean it was careless of me to makes such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person I thought it was your secret pride.\\" \\"I\'m thirty,\\" I said. \\"I\'m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.\\" She didn\'t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.","He was handsome then if never before, bound for one of those immortal moments which come so radiantly that their remembered light is enough to see by for years.","The purpose of a work of fiction is to appeal to the lingering after-effects in the reader\'s mind as differing from, say, the purpose of oratory or philosophy which respectively leave people in a fighting or thoughtful mood.","The compensation of a very early success is a conviction that life is a romantic matter. In the best sense one stays young.","You have to develop a conscience and if on top of that you have talent so much the better. But if you have talent without conscience, you are just one of many thousand journalists.","She was a dark, unenduring little flower - yet he thought he detected in her some quality of spiritual reticence, of strength drawn from her passive acceptance of all things. In this he was mistaken.","Receding from grief, it seems necessary to retrace the same steps that brought us there.","Gold? Yellow, glittering, precious gold?... This yellow slave Will knit and break religions, bless th\' accursed, Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves, And give them title, knee and approbation With senators on the bench.","I don\'t much care where I am anymore, nor expect very much from places.","So there was not an \\"I\\" anymore - not a basis on which I could organize my self-respect - save my limitless capacity for toil that it seemed I possessed no more.","Switzerland is a country where very few things begin, but many things end.","I just couldn\'t make the grade as a hack-that, like everything else, requires a certain practiced excellence.","he could transform the barest incident into a thing of curve and contour.","If all your clothes are worn to the same state, it means you go out too much.","Optimism is the content of small men in high places.","The two basic stories of all times are Cinderella and Jack the Giant Killer-the charm of women and the courage of men.","Fairies: Nature\'s attempt to get rid of soft boys by sterilizing them.","I never believe much in happiness. I never believe in misery either. Those are things you see on the stage or the screen or the printed page, they never really happen to you in life.","Your first most typical figure in any new place turns out to be a bluff or a local nuisance.","For awhile after you quit Keats all other poetry seems to be only whistling or humming.","Eighteen might look at thirty-four through a rising mist of adolescence, but twenty-two would see thirty-eight with discerning clarity.","Scratch a Yale man with both hands and you\'ll be lucky to find a coast-guard. Usually you find nothing at all.","When the first-rate author wants an exquisite heroine or a lovely morning, he finds that all the superlatives have been worn shoddy by his inferiors. It should be a rule that bad writers must start with plain heroines and ordinary mornings, and, if they are able, work up to something better.","sometimes i wish i\'d been an englishman; american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy","Now the standard cure for one who is sunk is to consider those in actual destitution or physical suffering","The mind of a little child is fascinating, for it looks on old things with new eyes-but at about twelve this changes. The adolescent offers nothing, can do nothing, say nothing that the adult cannot do better.","He\'s sensitive and I don\'t want him to break his heart over somebody who doesn\'t care about him.","Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues.","Though the Jazz Age continued it became less and less an affair of youth. The sequel was like a children\'s party taken over by the elders.","Amory: I love you. Rosalind: I love you- now.","he wanted people to like his mind again-after awhile it might be such a nice place in which to live.","I am a woman and my business is to hold things together. My business is to tear them apart.","...their eyes are full of kindness as each feels the full effect of novelty after a short separation. They are drawing a relaxation from each other\'s presence, a new serenity.","Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.","Beautiful things grow to a certain height and then they fail and fade off, breathing out memories as they decay.","Selfish people are in a way terribly capable of great loves.","When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. That\'s my middle-west - not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow.","How I feel is that if I wanted anything I\'d take it. That\'s what I\'ve always thought all my life. But it happens that I want you, and so I just haven\'t room for any other desires.","There was not a moving up into vacated places; there was simply an anachronistic staying on between a vanishing past and an incalculable future.","we both fitted. If our corners were not rubbed off they were at least pulled in. But deep in us both was something that made us require more for happiness. I didn\'t know what I wanted","Have a drink Tom and then you won\'t feel so foolish to yourself.","Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered \u201cListen,\u201d a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.","Many nights he lay there dreaming awake of secret caf\xe9s in Mont Marte, where ivory women delved in romantic mysteries with diplomats and soldiers of fortune, while orchestras played Hungarian waltzes and the air was thick and exotic with intrigue and moonlight and adventure.","And Yale is November, crisp and energetic.","Thirty--the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair.","My God,\' he gasped, \'you\'re fun to kiss.","Don\'t be so anxious about it,\' she laughed. \'I\'m not used to being loved. I wouldn\'t know what to do; I never got the trick of it.\' She looked down at him, shy and fatigued. \'So here we are. I told you years ago that I had the makings of Cinderella.\' He took her hand; she drew it back instinctively and then replaced it in his. \'Beg your pardon. Not even used to being touched. But I\'m not afraid of you, if you stay quiet and don\'t move suddenly.","He was resentful against all those in authority over him, and this, combined with a lazy indifference toward his work, exasperated every master in school. He grew discouraged and imagined himself a pariah; took to sulking in corners and reading after lights. With a dread of being alone he attached a few friends, but since they were not among the elite of the school, he used them simply as mirrors of himself, audiences before which he might do that posing absolutely essential to him. He was unbearably lonely, desperately unhappy.","It\'s just because I love the past that I want this house to look back on its glamourous moment of youth and beauty, and I want its stairs to creak as if to the footsteps of women with hoop skirts and men in boots and spurs. But they\'ve made it into a blondined, rouged-up old woman of sixty.","When you\'re older you\'ll know what people who love suffer. The agony. It\'s better to be cold and young than to love. It\'s happened to me before but never like this - so accidental - just when everything was going well.","The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.","They talked aimlessly back and forth, each speaking for the other.","But you can love more than just one person, can\'t you?","There was never a good biography of a good novelist. There couldn\'t be. He is too many people if he\'s any good.","I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.","Beauty and love pass, I know... Oh, there\'s sadness, too. I suppose all great happiness is a little sad. Beauty means the scent of roses and then the death of roses-","As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently an knowledge of his movements that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.","This is a valley of ashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.","You\'ve got an awfully kissable mouth.","I hope I haven\'t given you the impression that I consider kissing intrinsically irrational.","He was going to live in New York, and be known at every restaurant and caf\xe9, wearing a dress suit from early evening to early morning, sleeping away the dull hours of the forenoon.","It is youth\u2019s felicity as well as its insufficiency that it can never live in the present, but must always be measuring up the day against its own radiantly imagined future","He\'s so dumb he doesn\'t know he\'s alive.","Often a man can play the helpless child in front of a woman, but he can almost never bring it off when he feels most like a helpless child.","Intelligence is a mere instrument of circumstances.","I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart.","I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.","Human sympathy has its limits.","Well, let it pass, he thought; April is over, April is over. There are all kinds of love in the world, but never the same love twice. --The Sensible Thing","I may turn out an intellectual, but I\'ll never write anything but mediocre poetry.","Girls like you are responsible for all the tiresome colorless marriages; all those ghastly inefficiencies that pass as feminine qualities. What a blow it must be when a man with imagination marries the beautiful bundle of clothes that he\'s been building ideals around, and finds that she\'s just a weak, whining, cowardly mass of affectations!","I see you\'re looking at my cuff buttons.\\" I hadn\'t been looking at them, but I did now.","I must hold in balance the sense of the futility of effort and the sense of the necessity to struggle; the conviction of the inevitability of failure and still the determination to \'succeed\'-and, more than these, the contradiction between the dead hand of the past and the high intentions of the future. If I could do this through the common ills-domestic, professional and personal-then the ego would continue as an arrow shot from nothingness to nothingness with such force that only gravity would bring it to earth at last.","Stahr\'s eyes and Kathleen\'s met and tangled. For an instant they made love as no one ever dares to do after. Their glance was slower than an embrace, more urgent than a call.","Can\'t repeat the past?\\" he cried incredulously. \\"Why of course you can!\\" He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.","He wanted to care, and he could not care. For he had gone away and he could never go back anymore. The gates were closed, the sun was down, and there was no beauty left but the gray beauty of steel that withstands all time. Even the grief he could have borne was left behind in the country of youth, of illusion, of the richness of life, where his winter dreams had flourished.","Human sympathy has its limits, and we were contented to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind.","He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.","Her voice is full of money.","They weren\'t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale---and yet they weren\'t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.","Murder your darlings.","one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty\u2212one that everything afterward savors of anti\u2212climax.","But I suppose you must touch life in order to spring from it.","Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.","He\'s a bootlegger....One time he killed a man who found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.","He had angered Providence by resisting too many temptations. There was nothing left but heaven, where he would meet only those who, like him, had wasted earth.","Often I think writing is a sheer paring away of oneself leaving always something thinner, barer, more meagre.","then, as though it had been waiting on a near by roof for their arrival, the moon came slanting suddenly through the vines and turned the girl\'s face the color of white roses.","They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together.","I noticed that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes-there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon a golf course on clean, crisp, mornings.","the growth of intimacy is like that. First one gives off his best picture, the bright and finished product mended with bluff and falsehood and humour. Then more details are required and one paints a second portrait, and a third \u2013 before long the best lines cancel out \u2013 and the secret is exposed at last; the planes of the pictures have intermingled and given us away, and though we paint and paint we can no longer sell a picture. We must be satisfied with hoping that such fatuous accounts of ourselves as we make to our wives and children and business associates are accepted as true","Nicole\'s world had fallen to pieces, but it was only a flimsy and scarcely created world; beneath it her emotions and instincts fought on.","Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them-with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro\u2019s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances, which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro\u2019s warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.","Sometimes it is harder to deprive oneself of a pain than of a pleasure and the memory so possessed him that for the moment there was nothing to do but to pretend.","smoking had come to be an important punctuation mark in the long sentence of a day on the road.","Better let it all alone in the depths of her heart and the depths of the sea.","Good manners are an admission that everybody is so tender that they have to be handled with gloves. Now, human respect\u2014you don\'t call a man a coward or a liar lightly, but if you spend your life sparing people\'s feelings and feeding their vanity, you get so you can\'t distinguish what should be respected in them.","I avoided writers very carefully because they can perpetuate trouble as no one else can.","We haven\u2019t met for many years, said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be. \\"Five years next November.\\" The automatic quality set us all back at least another minute.","but they were frightened at his survivant will, once a will to live, now become a will to die.","I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade.","It is not necessarily poverty of spirit that makes a woman surround herself with life - it can be a superabundance of interest.","And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don\u2019t care what it\u2019s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction\u2014Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.","She\u2019s got an indiscreet voice,\u201d I remarked. \u201cIt\u2019s full of-\u201c I hesitated. \u201cHer voice is full of money,\u201d he said suddenly. That was it. I\u2019d never understood before. It was full of money-that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals\u2019 song of it.","I think that we already have a really good system in town, but I have a vision that it could be even better. My vision is that academic excellence is the area that we should pursue more, coupled with fiscal discipline.","All that kept her from breaking was that it was not an image of strength that was leaving her; she would be just as strong without him.","People talk of the courage of convictions, but in actual life a man\'s duty to his family may make a rigid course seem a selfish indulgence of his own righteousness.","One hurries through, even though there\'s time; the past, the continent, is behind; the future is the glowing mouth in the side of the ship; the dim, turbulent alley is too confusedly the present.","So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.","She knew few words and believed in none.","I think they\'re very attractive,\' Abe agreed. \'I just don\'t think they\'re attractive, that\'s all.","She admired him; she was used to clutching her hands together in his wake and heaving audible sighs.","He looked at her and for a moment she lived in the bright blue worlds of his eyes, eagerly and confidently.","I don\'t like girls in the daytime,\' he said shortly, and then thinking this a bit abrupt, he added: \'But I like you.\' He cleared his throat. \'I like you first and second and third.","I\'ll never be a poet,\' said Amory as he finished. \'I\'m not enough of a sensualist really; there are only a few obvious things that I notice as primarily beautiful: women, spring evenings, music at night, the sea; I don\'t catch the subtle things like \'silver-snarling trumpets.\' I may turn out an intellectual, but I\'ll never right anything but mediocre poetry.","In the morning you were never violently sorry-- you made no resolutions, but if you had overdone it and your heart was slightly out of order, you went on the wagon for a few days without saying anything about it, and waited until an accumulation of nervous boredom projected you into another party.","The notion of sitting down and conjuring up, not only words in which to clothe thoughts but thoughts worthy of being clothed--the whole thing was absurdly beyond his desires.","You\u2019re just the romantic age,\u201d she continued- \u201cfifty. Twenty-five is too worldly wise; thirty is apt to be pale from overwork; forty is the age of long stories that take a whole cigar to tell; sixty is- oh, sixty is too near seventy; but fifty is the mellow age. I love fifty.\u201d - Hildegarde","Want any of this stuff? Jordan?... Nick?\\" I didn\'t answer. Nick?\\" he asked again. What?\\" Want any?\\" No... I just remembered that today\'s my birthday.\\" I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade.","A sudden gust of rain blew over them and then another - as if small liquid clouds were bouncing along the land. Lightning entered the sea far off and the air blew full of crackling thunder. The table cloths blew around the pillars. They blew and blew and blew. The flags twisted around the red chairs like live things, the banners were ragged, the corners of the table tore off through the burbling billowing ends of the cloths.","\\"What are you going to do?\\" \\"Can\'t say - run for president, write -\\" \\"Greenwich Village?\\" \\"Good heavens, no - I said write - not drink.\\"","Very well then, better a sane crook than a mad puritan.","A writer wastes nothing.","She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.","he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.","I want to just be lazy and I want some of the people around me to be doing things, because that makes me feel comfortable and safe - and I want some of them to be doing nothing at all, because they can be graceful and companionable for me.","The first lights of the evening were springing into pale existence. The Ferris wheel, pricked out now in lights, revolved leisurely through the dusk; a few empty cars of the roller coaster rattled overhead.","Men don\u2019t often know those times when a girl could be had for nothing.","Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.","He hadn\u2019t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real.","If you\'re in love it ought to make you happy. You ought to laugh.","but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering.","i was perhaps an egotist in youth, but i soon found it made me morbid to think too much about myself","the best contacts are when one knows the obstacles and still wants to preserve a relation.","I was too absorbed to be responsive","all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately \u2014 and the decision must be made by some force \u2014 of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality \u2014 that was close at hand","Possibly it had occurred to him the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. [...] It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.","You can\u2019t repeat the past.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t repeat the past?\u201d he cried incredulously. \u201cWhy of course you can!","Her beauty climbed the rolling slope, it came into the room, rustling ghost-like through the curtains.","When I see a beautiful shell like that I can\'t help feeling a regret about what\'s inside it.","Amory thought how it was only the past that seemed strange and unbelievable.","If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.","Wine gave a sort of gallantry to their own failure.","I carry the place around the world in my heart but sometimes I try to shake it off in my dreams","New York had all the iridescence of the beginning of the world.","People living alone get used to loneliness.","I had traded the fight against love for the fight against loneliness, the fight against life for the fight against death.","I learned a little of beauty - enough to know that it had nothing to do with truth - and I found, moreover, that there was no great literary tradition; there was only the tradition of the eventful death of every literary tradition.","If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that registered earthquakes ten thousand miles away.","I\u2019m thirty,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor","interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end","He lifted his arms to the crystaline, radiant sky. \\"I know myself,\\" he cried, \\"but that is all.","The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the unclear voices of children, already gathered like crikets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight.","New friends can often have a better time together than old friends.","They were still in the happier stage of love. They were full of brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions, so that the communion of self with self seemed to be on a plane where no other human relations mattered. They both seemed to have arrived there with an extraordinary innocence as though a series of pure accidents had driven them together, so many accidents that at last they were forced to conclude that they were for each other. They had arrived with clean hands, or so it seemed, after no traffic with the merely curious and clandestine.","He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock.","If you spend your life sparing people\u2019s feelings and feeding their vanity, you get so you can\u2019t distinguish what should be respected in them.","You know I\'m old in some ways-in others-well, I\'m just a little girl. I like sunshine and pretty things and cheerfulness-and I dread responsibility.","You\'re the only girl I\'ve seen for a long time that actually did look like something blooming.","To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their (W/E Egg) dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.","You are mine-you know you\'re mine!\\" he cried wildly...the moonlight twisted in through the vines and listened...the fireflies hung upon their whispers as if to win his glance from the glory of their eyes.","For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened - then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.","She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.","I\u2019ve heard it said that Daisy\u2019s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.","Long afterward Amory thought of sophomore spring as the happiest time of his life. His ideas were in tune with life as he found it; he wanted no more than to drift and dream and enjoy a dozen new-found friendships through the April afternoons.","It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.","you once liked me, didn\'t you?, he asked. LIKED you- I LOVED you. Everybody loved you. You could\'ve had anybody you wanted for the asking.","but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game","There was even a recurrent idea in America about an education that would leave out history and the past, that should be a sort of equipment for aerial adventure, weighed down by none of the stowaways of inheritance or tradition.","I want leisure to read\u2014an immense amount.","I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.","Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.","He dispensed starlight to casual moths.","It was as if for the remainder of his life he was condemned to carry with him the egos of certain people, early met and early loved, and to be only as complete as they were complete themselves. There was some element of loneliness involved--so easy to be loved--so hard to love.","They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat\'s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.","The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.","It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with gray-turning, gold-turning light. The Shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.","It appears that every man\'s insomnia is as different from his neighbours as are their daytime hopes and aspirations.","The water reached up for her, pulled her down tenderly out of the heat, seeped in her hair and ran into the corners of her body. She turned round and round in it, embracing it, wallowing in it.","What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?","What do you think of that? It\u2019s stopped raining.\\" I\u2019m glad Jay.\\" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.","I\'m merely trying to give you the sort of argument that would appeal to your intelligence.","The bottle of whiskey - the second one - was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who \'felt just as good on nothing at all.","Young people do not perceive at once that the giver of wounds is the enemy and the quoted tattle merely the arrow.","It\u2019s just that I feel so sad these wonderful nights. I sort of feel they\u2019re never coming again, and I\u2019m not really getting all I could out of them.","They seemed nearer, not only mentally, but physically when they read ... Their chance was to make everything fine and finished and rich and imaginative; they must bend tiny golden tentacles from his imagination to hers, that would take the place of the great, deep love that was never so near, yet never so much of a dream.","Marriage was created not to be a background but to need one. Mine is going to be outstanding. It can\'t, shan\'t be the setting - it\'s going to be the performance, the lively, lovely, glamorous performance, and the world shall be the scenery.","Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life.","He had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it.","And after reading Thoreau I felt how much I have lost by leaving nature out of my life.","Show me a hero, and I\'ll write you a tragedy.","I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.","I\'m not sentimental--I\'m as romantic as you are. The idea, you know,is that the sentimental person thinks things will last--the romanticperson has a desperate confidence that they won\'t.","Whenever you feel like criticizing any one...just remember that all the people in this world haven\'t had the advantages that you\'ve had.","In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I\'ve been turning over in my mind ever since.\\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven\'t had the advantages that you\'ve had.","You don\'t write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say.","They\u2019re a rotten crowd\u2019, I shouted across the lawn. \u2018You\u2019re worth the whole damn bunch put together.","Think how you love me,\' she whispered. \'I don\'t ask you to love me always like this, but I ask you to remember.\'You\'ll always be like this to me.\'Oh no; but promise me you\'ll remember.\' Her tears were falling. \'I\'ll be different, but somewhere lost inside me there\'ll always be the person I am tonight.","And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby\u2019s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy\u2019s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that\'s no matter\u2014to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning\u2014\u2014So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.","I love her, and that\'s the beginning and end of everything.","If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him","Ah,\\" she cried, \\"you look so cool.\\" Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.You always look so cool,\\" she repeated.She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.","I\'m a slave to my emotions, to my likes, to my hatred of boredom, to most of my desires.","There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind\u2026","...and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires","I\u2019ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.","Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that\'s no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.","For what it\u2019s worth... it\u2019s never too late, or in my case too early, to be whoever you want to be. There\u2019s no time limit. Start whenever you want. You can change or stay the same. There are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you\u2019ve never felt before. I hope you meet people who have a different point of view. I hope you live a life you\u2019re proud of, and if you\u2019re not, I hope you have the courage to start over again.","Before I go on with this short history, let me make a general observation\u2013 the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life, when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the \\"impossible,\\" come true.","People over forty can seldom be permanently convinced of anything. At eighteen our convictions are hills from which we look; at forty-five they are caves in which we hide.","If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about...like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.","Youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.","They were careless people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.","Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered \u201cListen, a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.\u201d","She\u2019s got an indiscreet voice, I remarked. \u201cIt\u2019s full of\u2013\u201d I hesitated.\u201cHer voice is full of money,\u201d he said suddenly.That was it.

Somewhere inside me there\'ll always be the person I am to-night.","If it wasn\u2019t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,\\" said Gatsby. \\"You always have a green light that burns at the end of your dock.\\"Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to him, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted things had diminished by one.","One writes of scars healed, a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin, but there is no such thing in the life of an individual. There are open wounds, shrunk sometimes to the size of a pin-prick but wounds still. The marks of suffering are more comparable to the loss of a finger, or of the sight of an eye. We may not miss them, either, for one minute in a year, but if we should there is nothing to be done about it.","Well, let it pass, he thought; April is over, April is over.

This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the \\"creative temperament\\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.","What\'ll we do with ourselves this afternoon? cried Daisy, \u201cand the day after that, and the next thirty years?\u201d","All good writing is like swimming underwater and holding your breath.","In any case you mustn\'t confuse a single failure with a final defeat.","You\'re a slave, a bound helpless slave to one thing in this world, your imagination.","He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was ....","Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.","Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For awhile these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy\'s wing.","And he could not tell why the struggle was worthwhile, why he had determined to use the utmost himself and his heritage from the personalities he had passed...He stretched out his arms to the crystalline, radiant sky.I know myself,\\" he cried, \\"But that is all.","In the dead white hours in Zurich staring into a stranger\'s pantry across the upshine of a street-lamp, he used to think that he wanted to be good, he wanted to be kind, he wanted to be brave and wise, but it was all pretty difficult. He wanted to be loved, too, if he could fit it in.","Here was a new generation, shouting the old cries, learning the old creeds, through a revery of long days and nights; destined finally to go out into that dirty gray turmoil to follow love and pride; a new generation dedicated more than the last to the fear of poverty and the worship of success; grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken...","For what it\u2019s worth: it\u2019s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be.

I like to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others\u2014poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner\u2014young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.","The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise.","It eluded us then, but that\u2019s no matter\u2014tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . .

Twenty-five is too worldly wise; thirty is apt to be pale from overwork; forty is the age of long stories that take a whole cigar to tell; sixty is- oh, sixty is too near seventy; but fifty is the mellow age. I love fifty.\u201d - Hildegarde\u201d","I simply state that I\'m a product of a versatile mind in a restless generation-with every reason to throw my mind and pen in with the radicals. Even if, deep in my heart, I thought we were all blind atoms in a world as limited as a stroke of a pendulum, I and my sort would struggle against tradition; try, at least, to displace old cants with new ones. I\'ve thought I was right about life at various times, but faith is difficult. One thing I know. If living isn\'t seeking for the grail it may be a damned amusing game.","Vitality shows not only in the ability to persist, but in the ability to start over.","She was beautiful, but not like those girls in magazines. She was beautiful, for the way she thought. She was beautiful, for the sparkle in her eyes when she talked about something she loved. She was beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile, even if she was sad. No, she wasn\'t beautiful for something as temporary as her looks. She was beautiful, deep down to her soul. She is beautiful.","Everybody\'s youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.\'\'How pleasant then to be insane!","In a real dark night of the soul it is always three o\'clock in the morning, day after day.","Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees\u2014he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\\tHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy\u2019s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips\u2019 touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete. \\tThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something\u2014an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man\u2019s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.","You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn\'t I? I mean it was careless of me to makes such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person I thought it was your secret pride.\\"\\"I\'m thirty,\\" I said. \\"I\'m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.\\"She didn\'t answer.

But they were for himself now. He did not care about mouth and eyes and moving hands. He wanted to care, and he could not care. For he had gone away and he could never go back any more. The gates were closed, the sun was gone down, and there was no beauty but the gray beauty of steel that withstands all time. Even the grief he could have borne was left behind in the country of illusion, of youth, of the richness of life, where his winter dreams had flourished.\\"Long ago,\\" he said, \\"long ago, there was something in me, but now that thing is gone. Now that thing is gone, that thing is gone. I cannot cry. I cannot care. That thing will come back no more.","Under the stars,\' she repeated. \'I never noticed the stars before. I always thought of them as great big diamonds that belonged to someone. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream, all my youth.\'It was a dream,\' said John quietly. \'Everybody\'s youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.\'How pleasant then to be insane!\'So I\'m told,\' said John gloomily. \'I don\'t know any longer. At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That\'s a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it.","Of course all life is a process of breaking down, but the blows that do the dramatic side of the work-the big sudden blows that come, or seem to come, from outside-the ones you remember and blame things on and, in moments of weakness, tell your friends about, don\'t show their effect all at once. There is another sort of blow that comes from within-that you don\'t feel until it\'s too late to do anything about it, until you realize with finality that in some regard you will never be as good a man again. The first sort of breakage seems to happen quick-the second kind happens almost without your knowing it but is realized suddenly indeed.","At fifteen you had the radiance of early morning, at twenty you will begin to have the melancholy brilliance of the moon, and when you are my age you will give out, as I do, the genial golden warmth of 4 p.m.","Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,Till she cry \\"Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,I must have you!","Clark,\\" she said softly, \\"I wouldn\'t change you for the world. You\'re sweet the way you are. The things that\'ll make you fail I\'ll love always-- the living in the past, the lazy days and nights you have, and all your carelessness and generosity.","There was no God in his heart, he knew; his ideas were still in riot;there was ever the pain of memory; the regret for his lost youth-yet thewaters of disillusion had left a deposit on his soul, responsibility and alove of life, the faint stirring of old ambitions and unrealizeddreams......And he could not tell why the struggle was worth while, why he haddetermined to use to the utmost himself and his heritage from thepersonalities he had passed...He stretched out his arms to the crystalline, radiant sky.I know myself,\\" he cried, \\"but that is all.","There are open wounds, shrunk sometimes to the size of a pin-prick but wounds still.","The voice fell low, sank into her breast and stretched the tight bodice over her heart as she came up close. He felt the young lips, her body sighing in relief against the arm growing stronger to hold her. There were now no more plans than if Dick had arbitrarily made some indissoluble mixture, with atoms joined and inseparable; you could throw it all out but never again could they fit back into atomic scale. As he held her and tasted her, and as she curved in further and further toward him, with her own lips, new to herself, drowned and engulfed in love, yet solaced and triumphant, he was thankful to have an existence at all, if only as a reflection in her wet eyes.","But he hated to be sober. It made him conscious of the people around him, of that air of struggle, of greedy ambition, of hope more sordid than despair, of incessant passage up or down\u2026. There was kindliness about intoxication \u2013 there was the indescribable gloss and glamour it gave, like the memories of ephemeral and faded evenings","I don\'t ask you to love me always like this but I ask you to remember. Somewhere inside of me there will always be the person I am tonight.","You\u2019ll understand why storms are named after people.","Don\'t be so anxious about it,\' she laughed. \'I\'m not used to being loved. I wouldn\'t know what to do; I never got the trick of it.\' She looked down at him, shy and fatigued. \'So here we are. I told you years ago that I had the makings of Cinderella.\'He took her hand; she drew it back instinctively and then replaced it in his. \'Beg your pardon. Not even used to being touched. But I\'m not afraid of you, if you stay quiet and don\'t move suddenly.","no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . And then one fine morning\u2014So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.","Amory: I love you.Rosalind: I love you- now.","Very few of the people who accentuate the futility of life remark the futility of themselves. Perhaps they think that in proclaiming the evil of living they somehow salvage their own worth from the ruin - but they don\'t, even you and I...","I can\'t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she\'d throw me over, but she didn\'t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was, \'way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn\'t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?\\" On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat\'s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.","Either you think--or else others have to think for you and take power from you, pervert and discipline your natural tastes, civilize and sterilize you.","A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: \\"There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.","So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past..","They were careless people ... they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made . . . .","Breathing dreams like air","Beautiful things grow to a certain height and then they fail and fade off, breathing out memories as they decay","I love her and that\'s the beginning of everything...","...there seemed some necessity of taking all or nothing; it was as if for the remainder of his life he was condemned to carry with him the egos of certain people, early met and early loved, and to be only as complete as they were complete themselves. There was some element of loneliness involved--so easy to be loved--so hard to love.","She had somehow given over the thinking to him, and in his absences her every action seemed automatically governed by what he would like, so that now she felt inadequate to match her intentions against his. Yet think she must; she knew at last the number on the dreadful door of fantasy, the threshold to the escape that was no escape; she knew that for her greatest sin now and in the future was to delude herself. It had been a long lesson but she had learned it. Either you think\u2014or else others have to think for you and take power from you, pervert and discipline your natural tastes, civilize and sterilize you.","The fire blazing in her dark and injured heart seemed to glow around her like a flame.","We want to believe. Young students try to believe in older authors, constituents try to believe in their congressmen, countries try to believe in their statesmen, but they can\'t. Too many voices, too much scattered, illogical, ill-considered criticism. It\'s worse in the case of newspapers. Any rich, unprogressive old party with that particularly grasping, acquisitive form of mentality known as financial genius can own a paper that is the intellectual meat and drink of thousands of tired, hurried men, men too involved in the business of modern living to swallow anything but predigested food. For two cents the voter buys his politics, prejudices and philosophy. A year later there is a new political ring or a change in the paper\'s ownership, consequence: more confusion, more contradiction, a sudden inrush of new ideas, their tempering, their distillation, the reaction against them -","My whole theory of writing I can sum up in one sentence. An author ought to write for the youth of his own generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolmasters of ever afterward.","There\u2019s a writer for you, he said. \u201cKnows everything and at the same time he knows nothing.\u201d [narrator]It was my first inkling that he was a writer. And while I like writers\u2014because if you ask a writer anything you usually get an answer\u2014still it belittled him in my eyes. Writers aren\u2019t people exactly. Or, if they\u2019re any good, they\u2019re a whole lot of people trying so hard to be one person. It\u2019s like actors, who try so pathetically not to look in mirrors. Who lean backward trying\u2014only to see their faces in the reflecting chandeliers.\u201d","Mostly, we authors must repeat ourselves - that\'s the truth. We have two or three great and moving experiences in our lives - experiences so great and moving that it doesn\'t seem at the time anyone else has been so caught up and so pounded and dazzled and astonished and beaten and broken and rescued and illuminated and rewarded and humbled in just that way ever before.Then we learn our trade, well or less well, and we tell our two or three stories - each time in a new disguise - maybe ten times, maybe a hundred, as long as people will listen.","Her heart sank into her shoes as she realized at last how much she wanted him. No matter what his past was, no matter what he had done. Which was not to say that she would ever let him know, but only that he moved her chemically more than anyone she had ever met, that all other men seemed pale beside him.","I didn\u2019t realize it, but the days came along one after another, and then two years were gone, and everything was gone, and I was gone.","I\'m not used to being loved. I wouldn\'t know what to do.","Action is Character.","I wish I had done everything on earth with you","When Vanity kissed Vanity, a hundred happy Junes ago, he pondered o\'er her breathlessly, and, that all men might ever know, he rhymed her eyes with life and death:\\"Thru Time I\'ll save my love!\\" he said. . . yet Beauty vanished with his breath, and, with her lovers, she was dead. . .-Ever his wit and not her eyes, ever his art and not her hair:\\"Who\'d learn a trick in rhyme, be wise and pause before his sonnet there\\". . . So all my words, however true, might sing you to a thousandth June, and no one ever know that you were Beauty for an afternoon.","The world only exists in your eyes-- your conception of it. You can make it as big or as small as you want to. And you\'re trying to be a little puny individual. By God, if I ever cracked, I\'d try to make the world crack with me.","slowly she spread her arms and stood there swan-like, radiating a pride in her young perfection that lit a warm glow in Carlyle\'s heart. \\"We\'re going through the black air with our arms wide,\\" she called, \\"and our feet straight out behind like a dolphin\'s tail, and we\'re going to think we\'ll never hit the silver down there till suddenly it\'ll be all warm round us and full of little kissing, caressing waves.\\" Then she was in the air, and Carlyle involuntarily held his breath. He had not realized that the dive was nearly forty feet. It seemed an eternity before he heard the swift compact sound as she reached the sea. And it was with his glad sigh of relief when her light watery laughter curled up the side of the cliff and into his anxious ears that he knew he loved her.","First one gives off his best picture, the bright and finished product mended with bluff and falsehood and humor. Then more details are required and one paints a second portrait, and third---before long the best lines cancel out---and the secret is exposed at last; the planes of the picture have intermingled and given us away, and though we paint and paint we can no longer sell a picture. We must be satisfied with hoping such fatuous accounts of ourselves as we make to our wives and children and business associates are accepted as true.","What do you think of that? It\u2019s stopped raining.\\"I\u2019m glad Jay.\\" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.","He found something that he wanted, had always wanted and always would want -- not to be admired, as he had feared; not to be loved, as he had made himself believe; but to be necessary to people, to be indispensable...\'very few things matter and nothing matters very much","No one should live beyond 30","Your photograph is all I have: it is with me from the morning when I wake up with a frantic half dream about you to the last moment when I think of you and of death at night.","We haven\u2019t met for many years, said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.\\"Five years next November.\\"The automatic quality set us all back at least another minute.","THE VOICE: (to BEAUTY) Your life on earth will be, as always, the interval between two significant glances in a mundane mirror.","It happens that I want you, and so I just haven\u2019t room for any other desires.","I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.","Summer is only the unfulfilled promise of spring, a charlatan in place of the warm balmy nights I dream of in April.

Oh, I\'ve been through hell without a whine quite often--and the female hell is deadlier than the male.","First, he realized that the sea was blue and that there was an enormousquantity of it, and that it roared and roared-really all the banalitiesabout the ocean that one could realize, but if any one had told him thenthat these things were banalities, he would have gaped in wonder.","And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors\' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby\'s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.","Her beauty climbed the rolling slope, it came into the room, rustling ghost-like through the curtains...","Dick walked beside her, feeling her unhappiness, and wanting to drink the rain that touched her cheek.","and will I like being called a jazz baby? --You will love it.","She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her","The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath.

She turned to him and smiled, and as he saw her smile every rag of anger and hurt vanity dropped form him - as though his very moods were but the outer ripples of her own, as though emotion rose no longer in his breast unless she saw fit to pull an omnipotent controlling thread.","From the ruins, lonely and inexplicable as the sphinx, rose the Empire State Building. And just as it had been tradition of mine to climb to the Plaza roof to take leave of the beautiful city extending as far as the eyes could see, so now I went to the roof of that last and most magnificent of towers.Then I understood. Everything was explained. I had discovered the crowning error of the city. Its Pandora\'s box.Full of vaunting pride, the New Yorker had climbed here, and seen with dismay what he had never suspected. That the city was not the endless sucession of canyons that he had supposed, but that it had limits, fading out into the country on all sides into an expanse of green and blue. That alone was limitless. And with the awful realization that New York was a city after all and not a universe, the whole shining ediface that he had reared in his mind came crashing down.That was the gift of Alfred Smith to the citizens of New York.","one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.","I just think of people,\\" she continued, \\"whether they seem right where they are and fit into the picture. I don\'t mind if they don\'t do anything. I don\'t see why they should; in fact it always astonishes me when anybody does anything.\\" \\"You don\'t want to do anything?\\" \\"I want to sleep.\\" -Gloria Gilbert \\"Once upon a time all the men of mind and genius in the world became of one belief--that is to say, of no belief. But it wearied them to think that within a few years after their death many cults and systems and prognostications would be ascribed to them which they had never meditated nor intended. So they said to one another: \\"\'Let\'s join together and make a great book that will last forever to mock the credulity of man. Let\'s persuade our more erotic poets to write about the delights of the flesh, and induce some of our robust journalists to contribute stories of famous amours. We\'ll include all the most preposterous old wives\' tales now current. We\'ll choose the keenest satirist alive to compile a deity from all the deities worshipped by mankind, a deity who will be more magnificent than any of them, and yet so weakly human that he\'ll become a byword for laughter the world over--and we\'ll ascribe to him all sorts of jokes and vanities and rages, in which he\'ll be supposed to indulge for his own diversion, so that the people will read our book and ponder it, and there\'ll be no more nonsense in the world. \\"\'Finally, let us take care that the book possesses all the virtues of style, so that it may last forever as a witness to our profound scepticism and our universal irony.\' \\"So the men did, and they died. \\"But the book lived always, so beautifully had it been written, and so astounding the quality of imagination with which these men of mind and genius had endowed it. They had neglected to give it a name, but after they were dead it became known as the Bible.\\"-Maury Noble","all the time something within her was crying for a decision.She wanted her life shaped now, immediately \u2014 and the decision must be made by some force \u2014 of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality \u2014 that was close at hand","I\u2019d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.","The growth of intimacy is like that. First one gives off his best picture, the bight and finished product mended with bluff and falsehood and humor. Then more details are required and one paints a second portrait, and a third--before long the best lines cancel out--and the secret is exposed at last; the panes of the pictures have intermingled and given us away, and though we paint and paint we can no longer sell a picture. We must be satisfied with hoping that such famous accounts of ourselves as we make to our wives and children and business associates are accepted as true.","Sometimes I don\'t know whether Zelda and I are real or just characters in one of my novels.","As for Tom, the fact that he \\"had some woman in New York\\" was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.","Things are sweeter when they\'re lost.","When you get drunk you don\'t tear anything apart except yourself.","I don\u2019t want just words.

They are drawing a relaxation from each other\'s presence, a new serenity.","the victor belongs to the spoils","Cos\xec continuamo a remare, barche contro corrente, risospinti senza posa nel passato.","It was pleasant to drive back to the hotel in the late afternoon, above a sea as mysteriously colored as the agates and cornelians of childhood, green as green milk, blue as laundry water, wine dark.","There was music from my neighbor\'s house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before. Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York--every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler\'s thumb. At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby\'s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d\'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another. By seven o\'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other\'s names. The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light. Suddenly one of the gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray\'s understudy from the FOLLIES. The party has begun.","I don\'t want to sound like Pollyanna,\\" she began, \\"but you haven\'t grasped me yet. My courage is faith- faith in the eternal resilience of me- that joy\'ll come back, and hope and spontaneity. And I feel that till it does I\'ve got to keep my lips shut and my chin high and my eyes wide- not necessarily any silly smiling. Oh, I\'ve been through hell without a whine quite often- and the female hell is deadlier than the male.","But magic must hurry on, and the lovers remain...","Youth is like having a big plate of candy. Sentimentalists think they want to be in the pure, simple state they were in before they ate the candy. They don\'t. They just want the fun of eating it all over again. The matron doesn\'t want to repeat her girlhood, she wants to repeat her honeymoon. I don\'t want to repeat my innocence. I want the pleasure of losing it again.","What was it? Why won\'t you tell me?\\"\\"I don\'t want to break down your illusions.\\"\\"My dear man, I have no illusions about you.\\"\\"I mean illusions about yourself.","She is the most charming person in the world. That\u2019s all. I refuse to amplify. Excepting- she\u2019s perfect.","See that little stream \u2014 we could walk to it in two minutes. It took the British a month to walk to it \u2014 a whole empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind. And another empire walked very slowly backward a few inches a day, leaving the dead like a million bloody rugs. No Europeans will ever do that again in this generation.\u201cWhy, they\u2019ve only just quit over in Turkey,\u201d said Abe. \u201cAnd in Morocco \u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s different. This western-front business couldn\u2019t be done again, not for a long time. The young men think they could do it but they couldn\u2019t. They could fight the first Marne again but not this. This took religion and years of plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that existed between the classes. The Russians and Italians weren\u2019t any good on this front. You had to have a whole-souled sentimental equipment going back further than you could remember. You had to remember Christmas, and postcards of the Crown Prince and his fianc\xe9e, and little caf\xe9s in Valence and beer gardens in Unter den Linden and weddings at the mairie, and going to the Derby, and your grandfather\u2019s whiskers.\u201d\u201cGeneral Grant invented this kind of battle at Petersburg in sixty- five.\u201d\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t \u2014 he just invented mass butchery. This kind of battle was invented by Lewis Carroll and Jules Verne and whoever wrote Undine, and country deacons bowling and marraines in Marseilles and girls seduced in the back lanes of Wurtemburg and Westphalia. Why, this was a love battle \u2014 there was a century of middle-class love spent here. This was the last love battle.\u201d","Some people, were born to sit by a river. Some get struck by lightning. Some have an ear for music. Some are artists. Some swim. Some know buttons. Some know Shakespeare. Some are mothers. And some people, dance.","So he nodded, smiled, listened, was happy.","Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors\u2019 eyes \u2014 a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby\u2019s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby\u2019s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy\u2019s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that\u2019s no matter \u2014 to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther\u2026 . And one fine morning \u2014\u2014So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.","My story starts at sea, a perilous voyage to an unknown land. A shipwreck. The wild waters roar and heave. The brave vessel is dashed all to pieces. And all the helpless souls within her drowned. All save one. A lady. Whose soul is greater than the ocean, and her spirit stronger than the sea\'s embrace. Not for her a watery end, but a new life beginning on a stranger shore. It will be a love story. For she will be my heroine for all time. And her name will be Viola.\\"\\"She was incomprehensible, for, in her, soul and spirit were one - the beauty of her body was the essence of her soul. She was that unity sought for by philosophers through many centuries. In this outdoor waiting room of winds and stars she had been sitting for a hundred years, at peace in the contemplation of herself.\\"\\"He knew that there was passion there, but there was no shadow of it in her eyes or on her mouth; there was a faint spray of champagne on her breath. She clung nearer desperately and once more he kissed her and was chilled by the innocence of her kiss, by the glance that at the moment of contact looked beyond him out into the darkness of the night, the darkness of the world.\\"\\"Her heart sank into her shoes as she realized at last how much she wanted him. No matter what his past was, no matter what he had done. Which was not to say that she would ever let him know, but only that he moved her chemically more than anyone she had ever met, that all other men seemed pale beside him.\\"\\"I used to build dreams about you.\\"\\"Then she kissed him until the sky seemed to fade out and all her smiles and tears to vanish in an ecstasy of eternal seconds.","Their eyes met and they stared together at each other, alone in space.","Writers aren\'t exactly people.... They\'re a whole bunch of people trying to be one person.","After slipping on a negligee and making herself comfortable on the lounge, she became conscious that she was miserable and that the tears were rolling down her cheeks. She wondered if they were the tears of self-pity, and tried resolutely not to cry, but this existence without hope, without happiness, oppressed her, and she kept shaking her head from side to side, her mouth drawn down tremulously in the corners, as though she were denying the assertion made by some one, somewhere. She did not know that this gesture of hers was years older than history, that, for a hundred generations of men, intolerable and persistent grief has offered that gesture, of denial, of protest, of bewilderment, to something more profound, more powerful than the God made in the image of man, and before which that God, did he exist, would be equally impotent. It is a truth set at the heart of tragedy that this force never explains, never answers - this force intangible as air, more definite than death.","A man does not recover from such jolts-- he becomes a different person and, eventually, the new person finds new things to care about.","Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn\'t care.","If I hurt your feelings we ought to discuss it. I don\'t like this kiss-and-forget.\'\'But I don\'t want to argue. I think it\'s wonderful that we can kiss and forget, and when we can\'t it\'ll be time to argue.","Man in his hunger for faith will feed his mind with the nearest and most convenient food.","The great tapestries of trees had darkened to ghosts back at the last edge of twilight. The early moon had drenched the arches with pale blue, and, weaving over the night, in and out of the gossamer rifts of moon, swept a song, a song with more than a hint of sadness, infinitely transient, infinitely regretful.","He thinks himself rather an exceptional young man, thoroughly sophisticated, well adjusted to his environment, and somewhat more significant than any one else he knows.","Amory wandered slowly up the avenue and thought of the night as inevitably his-- the pageantry and carnival of rich dusk and dim streets... it seemed that he had closed the book of fading harmonies at last and stepped into the sensuous vibrant walks of life. Everywhere these countless lights, this promise of a night of streets and singing-- he moved in a half-dream through the crowd as if expecting to meet Rosalind hurrying toward him with eager feet from every corner... How the unforgettable faces of dusk would blend to her, the myriad footsteps, a thousand overtures, would blend to her footsteps; and there would be more drunkenness than wine in the softness of her eyes on his. Even his dreams now were faint violins drifting like summer sounds upon the summer air.","If we could only learn to look on evil as evil, whether it\'s clothed in filth or monotony or magnificence.","The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption - and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them good-by.","They\'re such beautiful shirts,\' she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. \'It makes me sad because I\'ve never seen such - such beautiful shirts before.","In consequence I\'m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought - frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon - for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.","I never understood what common sense mean applied to a complicated problems.","Then she added in a sort of childish delight: \'We\'ll be poor, won\'t we? Like people in books. And I\'ll be an orphan and utterly free. Free and poor! What fun!\' She stopped and raised her lips to him in a delighted kiss.\'It\'s impossible to be both together,\' said John grimly. \'People have found that out. And I should choose to be free as preferable of the two...","And so we beat on, books against the critics, borne back ceaslessly into rewrites.","He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise","It is not necessarily poverty of spirit that makes a woman surround herself with life\u2014it can be a superabundance of interest...","You and I have been happy; we haven\u2019t been happy just once, we\u2019ve been happy a thousand times. The chances that spring, that\u2019s for everyone, like in the popular songs, may belong to us too \u2013 the chances are pretty bright at this time because as usual, I can carry most of contemporary literary opinion, liquidated, in the hollow of my hand \u2013 and when I do, I see the swan floating on it and \u2013 I find it to be you and you only\u2026. Forget the past \u2013 what you can of it, and turn about and swim back home to me, to your haven for ever and ever \u2013 even though it may seem a dark cave at times and lit with torches of fury; it is the best refuge for you \u2013 turn gently in the waters through which you move and sail back\u2026","I\'m a cynical idealist.\' He paused and wondered if that meant anything.","There was a midsummer restlessness abroad\u2014early August with imprudent loves and impulsive crimes.","Even when everything seems rotten you can\'t trust that judgement,\' Gloria had said. \'It\'s the sum of all your judgements that counts.","No personality as strong as Zelda\u2019s could go without getting criticisms and as you say she is not above reproach. I\'ve always known that. Any girl who gets stewed in public, who frankly enjoys and tells shocking stories, who smokes constantly and makes the remark that she has \u201ckissed thousands of men and intends to kiss thousands more, cannot be considered beyond reproach even if above it. But Isabelle I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity and her flaming self respect and it\u2019s these things I\u2019d believe in even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn\'t all that she should be.But of course the real reason, Isabelle, is that I love her and that\u2019s the beginning and end of everything. You\u2019re still a Catholic but Zelda\u2019s the only God I have left now.\u201d","Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, he told me, \u201cjust remember that all the people in this world haven\u2019t had the advantages that you\u2019ve had.\u201d","Rather nice night, after all. Stars are out and everything. Exceptionally tasty assortment of them.","Talk English to me, Tommy.Parlez francais avec moi, Nicole.But the meanings are different-- in French you can be heroic and gallant with dignity, and you know it. But in English you can\'t be heroic and gallant without being a little absurd, and you know that too.","The dream was gone. Something had been taken from him. In a sort of panic he pushed the palms of his hands into his eyes and tried to bring up a picture of the waters lapping on Sherry Island and the moonlit veranda, and gingham on the golf-links and the dry sun and the gold color of her neck\'s soft down. And her mouth damp to his kisses and her eyes plaintive with melancholy and her freshness like new fine linen in the morning. Why, these things were no longer in the world! They had existed and they existed no longer.For the first time in years the tears were streaming down his face. But they were for himself now. He did not care about mouth and eyes and moving hands. He wanted to care, and he could not care. For he had gone away and he could never go back any more. The gates were closed, the sun was gone down, and there was no beauty but the gray beauty of steel that withstands all time. Even the grief he could have borne was left behind in the country of illusion, of youth, of the richness of life, where his winter dreams had flourished.\u201cLong ago, he said, \u201clong ago, there was something in me, but now that thing is gone. Now that thing is gone, that thing is gone. I cannot cry. I cannot care. That thing will come back no more.\u201d","We ruined ourselves-I have never honestly thought that we ruined each other.","Is kissing you generally considered a joyful affair?\\" -","You\'re worth the whole damn bunch put together.","To be afraid, a person has either to be very great and strong-- or else a coward. I\'m neither.","After the sureties of youth there sets in a period of intense and intolerable complexity. With the soda-jerker this period is so short as to be almost negligible. Men higher in the scale hold out longer in the attempt to preserve the ultimate niceties of relationship, to retain \\"impractical\\" ideas of integrity. But by the late twenties the business has grown too intricate, and what has hitherto been imminent and confusing has become gradually remote and dim. Routine comes down like twilight on a harsh landscape, softening it until it is tolerable. The complexity is too subtle, too varied; the values are changing utterly with each lesion of vitality; it has begun to appear that we can learn nothing from the past with which to face the future - so we cease to be impulsive, convincible men, interested in what is ethically true by fine margins, we substitute rules of conduct for rules of integrity, we value safety above romance, we become, quite unconsciously, pragmatic. It is left to the few to be persistently concerned with the nuances of relationships - and even this few only in certain hours especially set aside for the task.","Will father be there?\\" she asked.John turned to her in astonishment.Your father is dead,\\" he replied somberly. \\"Why should he go to Hades? You have it confused with another place that was abolished long ago.\\"After supper they folded up the table-cloth and spread their blankets for the night.What a dream it was,\\" Kismine sighed, gazing up at the stars. \\"How strange it seems to be here with one dress and a penniless fianc_!Under the stars,\\" she repeated. \\"I never noticed the stars before. I always thought of them as great big diamonds that belonged to some one. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream, all my youth.\\"It was a dream,\\" said John quietly. \\"Everybody\'s youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.\\"How pleasant then to be insane!\\"So I\'m told,\\" said John gloomily. \\"I don\'t know any longer. At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That\'s a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it.\\" He shivered. \\"Turn up your coat collar, little girl, the night\'s full of chill and you\'ll get pneumonia. His was a great sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours.\\"So wrapping himself in his blanket he fell off to sleep.","Who is he anyhow, an actor?\\"\\"No.\\"\\"A dentist?\\"\\"...No, he\'s a gambler.\\" Gatsby hesitated, then added cooly: \\"He\'s the man who fixed the World Series back in 1919.\\"\\"Fixed the World Series?\\" I repeated.The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as something that merely happened, the end of an inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people--with the singlemindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.\\"How did he happen to do that?\\" I asked after a minute.\\"He just saw the opportunity.\\"\\"Why isn\'t he in jail?\\"\\"They can\'t get him, old sport. He\'s a smart man.","I live in a house over there on the Island, and in that house there is a man waiting for me.

Looks the same, smells the same, feels the same. You\'ll realize what\'s changed is you.","From the night into his high-walled room there came, persistently, that evanescent and dissolving sound - something the city was tossing up and calling back again, like a child playing with a ball. In Harlem, the Bronx, Gramercy Park, and along the water-fronts, in little parlors or on pebble-strewn, moon-flooded roofs, a thousand lovers were making this sound, crying little fragments of it into the air. All the city was playing with this sound out there in the blue summer dark, throwing it up and calling it back, promising that, in a little while, life would be beautiful as a story, promising happiness - and by that promise giving it. It gave love hope in its own survival. It could do no more.","By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.","I want it to smell of magnolias insteadof peanuts and I want my shoes to crunch on the same gravel that Lee\'sboots crunched on.

Rosalind is-- utterly Rosalind. She is one of those girls who need never make the slightest effort to have men fall in love with them. Two types of men seldom do: dull men are usually afraid of her cleverness and intellectual men are usually afraid of her beauty. All others are hers by natural prerogative.","A rigour passed over him,blood rose into his cheeks, his forehead, and there was a steady thumping in his ears. It was first love.","I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.","Nancy had a mouth like a remembered kiss...","He saw her before he saw anything else in the room.","Poetry is dying first. It\'ll be absorbed into prose sooner or later.","What a feeble thing intelligence is, with its short steps, its waverings, its pacings back and forth, its disastrous retreats! Intelligence is a mere instrument of circumstances. There are people who say that intelligence must have built the universe - why, intelligence never built a steam-engine! Circumstances built a steam-engine. Intelligence is little more than a short foot-rule by which we measure the infinite achievements of Circumstances.","There was nothing, it seemed, that grew stale so soon as pleasure.","Here, Earth-born, over the lilt of the water,Lisping its music and bearing a burden of light,Bosoming day as a laughing and radiant daughter\u2026Here we may whisper unheard, unafraid of the night.Walking alone\u2026was it splendor, or what, we were bound with?Deep in the time when summer lets down her hair?Shadows we loved and the patterns they covered the ground withTapestries, mystical, faint in the breathless air.","These things excite me so,\u2019 she whispered. \u2018If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I\'ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.","Nobody ever became a writer just by wanting to be one. If you have anything to say, anything you feel nobody has ever said before, you have got to feel it so desperately that you will find some way to say it that nobody has ever found before, so that the thing you have to say and the way of saying it blend as one matter--as indissolubly as if they were conceived together.","Don\'t you know you can\'t do anything about people?","Amory wondered how people could fail to notice that he was a boy marked for glory, and when faces of the throng turned toward him and ambiguous eyes stared into his, he assumed the most romantic of expressions and walked on the air cushions that lie on the asphalts of fourteen...","You can\'t live forever; you can\'t live forever.","Open the whisky, Tom,\' she ordered, \'and I\'ll make you a mint julep.

Look at the mint!","Of course all life is a process of breaking down, but the blows that do the dramatic side of the work-the big sudden blows that come, or seem to come, from outside-the ones you remember and blame things on and, in moments of weakness, tell your friends about, don\'t show their effect all at once.","He kissed her because it came about quite naturally; he found sweetness sleeping still upon her lips, and felt that he had never been away.","And then, one fairy night, May became June.","How do you do, Captain, she said, unfastening her eyes from his with difficulty, as though they had become entangled.\u201d","Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed.","There was a pause. Then she smiled and the corners of her mouth drooped and an almost imperceptible sway brought her closer to him, looking up into his eyes. A lump rose in Dexter\'s throat, and he waited breathless for the experiment, facing the unpredictable compound that would form mysteriously from the elements of their lips. Then he saw--she communicated her excitement to him, lavishly, deeply, with kisses that were not a promise but a fulfillment. They aroused in him not hunger demanding renewal but surfeit that would demand more surfeit . . . kisses that were like charity, creating want by holding back nothing at all.","It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm, and so I told him I\u2019d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn\u2019t hardly know I wasn\u2019t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was \u2018You can\u2019t live forever; you can\u2019t live forever.","Youth is like having a big plate of candy. Sentimentalists think they want to be in the pure, simple state they were in before they ate the candy. They don\'t. They just want the fun of eating it all over again. The matron doesn\'t want to repeat her girlhood - she wants to repeat her honeymoon. I don\'t want to repeat my innocence. I want the pleasure of losing it again.","Isn\u2019t Hollywood a dump \u2014 in the human sense of the word. A hideous town, pointed up by the insulting gardens of its rich, full of the human spirit at a new low of debasement.","i\'m in a muddle about a lot of things -- i\'ve just discovered that i\'ve a mind, and i\'m starting to read\\"\\"read what?\\"\\"everything. i have to pick and choose, of course, but mostly things that make me think.","They conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with an amusement park.","Everybody\u2019s youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.","I want excitement; and I don\u2019t care what form it takes or what I pay for it, so long as it makes my heart beat.","Good luck to you and bad luck to your theories.","The sheath that held her soul had assumed significance - that was all. She was a sun, radiant, growing, gathering light and storing it - then after an eternity pouring it forth in a glance, the fragment of a sentence, to that part of him that cherished all beauty and all illusion.","Beauty is only to be admired, only to be loved - to be harvested carefully and then flung at a chosen lover like a gift of roses. It seems to me, so far as I can judge clearly at all, that my beauty would be used like that...","She was beautiful-- but especially she was without mercy. He must own that strength that could send him away.","A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\u201cWhat do you think? he demanded impetuously.\u201cAbout what?\u201dHe waved his hand toward the book-shelves.\u201cAbout that. As a matter of fact you needn\u2019t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They\u2019re real.\u201d\u201cThe books?\u201dHe nodded.\u201cAbsolutely real \u2014 have pages and everything. I thought they\u2019d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they\u2019re absolutely real. Pages and \u2014 Here! Lemme show you.\u201dTaking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the \u201cStoddard Lectures.\u201d\u201cSee!\u201d he cried triumphantly. \u201cIt\u2019s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella\u2019s a regular Belasco. It\u2019s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too \u2014 didn\u2019t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?\u201d","The soft rush of taxis by him, and laughter, laughters hoarse as a crow\'s, incessant and loud, with the rumble of the subways underneath - and over all, the revolutions of light, the growings and recedings of light - light dividing like pearls - forming and reforming in glittering bars and circles and monstrous grotesque figures cut amazingly on the sky.","I can\'t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport.I even hoped for a while that she\'d throw me over, but she didn\'t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her. Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn\'t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?","Believe me, I may be a bit blas\xe9, but I can still get any man I want.","January, the Monday of months....","In two weeks it\'ll be the longest day in the year... Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.","There are certain things which are human nature,\\" he asserted with an owl-like look, \\"which always have been and always will be, which can\'t be changed.\\" Amory looked from the small man to the big man helplessly. \\"Listen to that! That\'s what makes me discouraged with progress. Listen to that! I can name offhand over one hundred natural phenomena that have been changed by the will of man--a hundred instincts in man that have been wiped out or are now held in check by civilization. What this man here just said has been for thousands of years the last refuge of the associated mutton-heads of the world. It negates the efforts of every scientist, statesman, moralist, reformer, doctor, and philosopher that ever gave his life to humanity\'s service. It\'s a flat impeachment of all that\'s worth while in human nature. Every person over twenty-five years old who makes that statement in cold blood ought to be deprived of the franchise.","We are all queer fish, queerer behind our faces and voices than we want any one to know or than we know ourselves.","When his son was dressed Mr. Button regarded him with depression. The costume consisted of dotted socks, pink pants, and a belted blouse with a wide white collar. Over the latter waved the long whitish beard, drooping almost to the waist. The effect was not good.","When I want something bad enough, common sense tells me to go and take it--and not get caught.","December tumbled like a dead leaf from the calendar.","credit is something that should be given to others. If you are in a position to give credit to yourself, then you do not need it.","As I went over to say good-by I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby\'s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams-not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart","It was a dark afternoon, threatening rain and the end of the world, and done in that particularly gloomy gray in which only New York afternoons indulge. A breeze was crying down the streets, whisking along battered newspapers and pieces of things, and little lights were pricking out all the windows- it was so desolate that one was sorry for the tops of sky-scrapers lost up there in the dark green and gray heaven.","I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.","I only wanted absolute quiet to think out why I had developed a sad attitude toward sadness, a melancholy attitude toward melancholy and a tragic attitude toward tragedy \u2014 why I had become identified with the objects of my horror or compassion.","The world is so overgrown that it can\'t lift its own fingers, and I was planning to be such an important finger-","Look here, old sport,\\" he broke out surprisingly. \\"What\'s your opinion of me, anyhow?\\" A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.","Happiness is only the first hour after the alleviation of some especially intense misery.","In the strangeness of the brightening day it seemed presumptuous that with this feeble, broken instrument of his mind he had ever tried to think.","This western-front business couldn\u2019t be done again, not for a long time. The young men think they could do it but they couldn\u2019t. They could fight the first Marne again but not this. This took religion and years of plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that existed between the classes. The Russians and Italians weren\u2019t any good on this front. You had to have a whole-souled sentimental equipment going back further than you could remember. You had to remember Christmas, and postcards of the Crown Prince and his fianc\xe9e, and little caf\xe9s in Valence and beer gardens in Unter den Linden and weddings at the mairie, and going to the Derby, and your grandfather\u2019s whiskers.","I don\'t complain of conventional morality. I complain rather of the mediocre heretics who seize upon the findings of sophistication and adopt the pose of a moral freedom to which they are by no means entitled by their intelligences.","Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I\'d been writing letters once a week and signing them: \\"Love, Nick,\\" and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.","Whatever I am, you did it.","God, am I like the rest after all?\\"\u2014So he used to think starting awake at night\u2014\\"Am I like the rest?","Compromising with events time moves along.","Only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, towards that lost voice across the room.","Oh, it doesn\'t get me. I\'m pretty well cloistered, and I suppose books mean more than people to me anyway.","As an indifference cherished, or left to atrophy, becomes an emptiness, to this extent he had learned to become empty of Nicole, serving her against his will with negations and emotional neglect. One writes of scars healed, a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin, but there is no such thing in the life of an individual. There are open wounds, shrunk sometimes to the size of a pin-prick, but wounds still. The marks of suffering are more comparable to the loss of a finger, or of the sight of an eye. We may not miss them, either, for one minute in a year, but if we should there is nothing to be done about it.","Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven-a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anti-climax.","I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets... I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without.","But at three o\'clock in the morning, a forgotten package has the same tragic importance as a death sentence, and the cure doesn\'t work-- and in a real dark night of the soul it is always three o\'clock in the morning, day after day.","Something bright and alien flashed across the sky... and for a moment people set down their glasses in country clubs and speakeasies and thought of their old best dreams. Maybe there was a way out by flying, maybe our restless blood could find frontiers in the illimitable air. But by that time we were all pretty well committed; and the Jazz Age continued; we would all have one more.","He lifted his arms to the crystaline, radiant sky.\\"I know myself,\\" he cried, \\"but that is all.","I just think of people,\\" she continued, \\"whether they seem right where they are and fit into a picture. I don\'t mind if they don\'t do anything. I don\'t see why they should; in fact it always astonishes me when people do anything.","A man who was aware that there could be no honor and yet had honor, who knew the sophistry of courage and yet was brave.","But Dick had come away for his soul\'s sake, and he began thinking about that. He had lost himself--he could not tell the hour when, or the day or the week, the month or the year.","He found that the business of optimism was no mean task.","Nothing any good isn\u2019t hard.","The breathless idyl of their engagement gave way, first, to the intense romance of the more passionate relationship. The breathless idyl left them, fled on to other lovers; they looked around one day it and it was gone, how, they scarcely knew. Had either of them lost the other in the days of the idyl, the love lost would have been ever to the loser that dim desire without fulfillment which stands back of all life. But magic must hurry on, and the lovers remain...","But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age.","He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is. and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.","Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn\'t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.","That\'s my Middle West-not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family\'s name.","The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea. The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.","How good to have things like this, to be worshipped again, to pretend to have a mystery!","Until the great mobs could be educated into a moral sense, someone must cry: \\"Thou shalt not!","He was in love with every pretty woman he saw now, their forms at a distance, their shadows on the walls.","She walked rather quickly; she liked to be active, though at times she gave an impression of repose that was at once static and evocative. This was because she knew few words and believed in none, and in the world she was rather silent, contributing just her share of urbane humor with a precision that approached meagreness. But at the moment when strangers tended to grow uncomfortable in the presence of this economy she would seize the topic and rush off with it, feverishly surprised with herself-- then bring it back and relinquish it abruptly, almost timidly, like an obedient retriever, having been adequate and something more.","I\'m sorry I was short with him--but I don\'t like a man to approach me telling me it for my sake.\\"Maybe it was,\\" said Wylie\\"It\'s poor technique.\\"\\"I\'d all for it,\\" said Wylie. \\"I\'m vain as a woman. If anybody pretends to be interested in me, I\'ll ask for more. I like advice.\\"Stahr shook his head distastefully. Wylie kept on ribbing him--he was one of those to whom this privilege was permitted. \\"You fall for some kinds of flattery,\\" he said. \\"this \'little Napoleon stuff.\'\\"\\"It makes me sick,\\" said Stahr, \\"but it\'s not as bad as some man trying to help you.\\"\\"If you don\'t like advice, why do you pay me?\\"\\"That\'s a question of merchandise,\\" said Stahr. \\"I\'m a merchant. I want to buy what\'s in your mind.\\"\\"You\'re no merchant,\\" said Wylie. \\"I knew a lot of them when I was a publicity man, and I agree with Charles Francis Adams.\\"\\"What did he say?\\"\\"He knew them all--Gould, Vanderbilt, Carnegie, Astor--and he said there wasn\'t one he\'d care to meet again in the hereafter. Well--they haven\'t improved since then, and that\'s why I say you\'re no merchant.\\"\\"Adams was probably a sourbelly,\\" said Stahr. \\"He wanted to be head man himself, but he didn\'t have the judgement or else the character.\\" \\"He had brains,\\" said Wylie rather tartly.\\"It takes more than brains. You writers and artists poop out and get all mixed up, and somebody has to come in and straighten you out.\\" He shrugged his shoulders. \\"You seem to take things so personally, hating people and worshipping them--always thinking people are so important-especially yourselves. You just ask to be kicked around. I like people and I like them to like me, but I wear my heart where God put it--on the inside.","I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn\u2019t be over-dreamed\u2014that voice was a deathless song.","I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.","For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment o the \'Beale Street Blues\' while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shiny dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.","I don\'t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while.","What are you going to do? \\"Can\'t say - run for president, write -\\" \\"Greenwich Village?\\" \\"Good heavens, no - I said write - not drink.","Irony was the final polish of the shoe, the ultimate dab of the clothes-brush, a sort of intellectual \\"There!","We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around. \u2018They\u2019re a rotten crowd,\u2019 I shouted across the lawn. \u2018You\u2019re worth the whole damn bunch put together.\u2019 I\u2019ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.","Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther...","Another sigh came from the window-- quite a resigned sigh. \'She\'s life and hope and happiness, my whole world now.\' He felt the quiver of a tear on his eyelid.","But an inferior talent can only be graceful when it\'s carrying inferior ideas. And the more narrowly you can look at a thing the more entertaining you can be about it.","I married the heroine of my stories.","Benjamin felt himself on the verge of a proposal--with an effort he choked back the impulse. \\"You\'re just theromantic age,\\" she continued--\\"fifty. Twenty-five is too wordly-wise; thirty is apt to be pale from overwork;forty is the age of long stories that take a whole cigar to tell; sixty is--oh, sixty is too near seventy; but fifty isthe mellow age. I love fifty.","At the gray tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.","You will feel your own reflection sliding along the eyes of those who look at you. You are no longer insulated; but I suppose you must touch life in order to spring from it.","Is your underwear purple, too?","It\'s so hard to find a male to gratify one\'s artistic tastes.","a great social success is a pretty girl who plays her cards as carefully as if she were plain","Most of us are content to exist and breed and fight for the right to do both, and the dominant idea, the foredoomed attest to control one\'s destiny, is reserved for the fortunate or unfortunate few.","A pause; it endured horribly.","She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. \'All right,\' I said, \'I\'m glad it\'s a girl. And I hope she\'ll be a fool \u2013 that\'s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.","The fruit of youth or of the grape, the transitory magic of the brief passage from darkness to darkness - the old illusion that truth and beauty were in some way entwined.","Gloria was sure she wanted but to read and dream and be fed tomato sandwiches and lemonades by some angelic servant","This isn\u2019t just an epigram \u2014 life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.","Her voice is full of money,\\"...That was it. I\'d never understood before. It was full of money- that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals\' song of it....High in a white palace the king\'s daughter, the golden girl....","People fall in and out of love all the time. I wonder how they manage it.","Rich girls don\'t marry poor boys, Jay Gatsby","--I\'m a slave to my emotions, to my likes, to my hatred of boredom, to most of my desires---- \\"You are not!\\" She brought one little fist down onto the other. \\"You\'re a slave, a bound helpless slave to one thing in the world, your imagination.","I\u2019m more beautiful than anybody else, she said brokenly, \u201cwhy can\u2019t I be happy?\u201d","As he put in his studs he realized that he was enjoying life as he would probably never enjoy it again. Everything was hallowed by the haze of his own youth. He had arrived, abreast of the best in his generation at Princeton. He was in love and his love was returned.","The tears coursed down her cheeks - not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep.","There were girls who would tear you apart with their lips.","You are mysterious. I love you. You\u2019re beautiful, intelligent, and virtuous, and that\u2019s the rarest known combination.","Then he put in a call for Nicole in Zurich, remembering so many things as he waited, and wishing he had always been as good as he had intended to be.","At first I was surprised and confused; then as he lay in his house and didn\'t move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.","Life begins again when it gets crisp in the fall.","You and I have been happy; we haven\'t been happy just once, we\'ve been happy a thousand times. . . Forget the past-what you can of it, and turn about and swim back home to me, to your haven forever and ever-even though it may seem a dark cave at times and lit with torches of fury; it is the best refuge for you-turn gently in the water through which you move and sail back.","Idiot!\\" he cried, \\"that from you! Here I sit, young Anthony, as I\'ll sit for a generation or more and watch such gay souls as you and Dick and Gloria Gilbery go past me, dancing and singing and loving and hating one another and being moved, being eternally moved. And I am moved only by my lack of emotion. I shall sit and the snow will come--oh, for a Caramel to take notes--and another winter and I shall be thirty and you and Dick and Gloria will go on being eternally moved and dancing by me and singing. But after you\'ve all gone I\'ll be saying things for new Dicks to write down, and listening to the disillusions and cynicisms and emotions of new Anthonys--yes, and talking to new Glorias about the tans of summers yet to come.\\"\\tThe firelight flurried up on the hearth. Maury left the window, stirred the blaze with a poker, and dropped a log upon the andirons. Then he sat back in his chair and the remnants of his voice faded in the new fire that spit red and yellow along the bark.\\t\\"After all, Anthony, it\'s you who are very romantic and young. It\'s you who are infinitely more susceptible and afraid of your calm being broken. It\'s me who tries again and again to be moved--let myself go a thousand times and I\'m always me. Nothing--quite--stirs me.\\t\\"Yet,\\" he murmured after another long pause, \\"there was something about that little girl with her absurd tan that was eternally old--like me.","No,\\" interrupted Marcia emphatically. \\"And you\'re a sweet boy. Come here and kiss me.\\"Horace stopped quickly in front of her.\\"Why do you want me to kiss you?\\" he asked intently. \\"Do you just go round kissing people?\\"\\"Why, yes,\\" admitted Marcia, unruffled. \\"\'At\'s all life is. Just going around kissing people.","Suddenly he was inside the radius of her perfume and kissing her breathlessly.","They damned the books I read and the things I thought by calling them immoral; later the fashion changed, and they damned things by calling them \u2018clever.","My God, she\'s good-looking!\\" said Mr. Sandwood, who was just over thirty.\\"Good-looking!\\" cried Mr. Hedrick contemptuously, \\"she always looks as if she wanted to be kissed! Turning those big cow-eyes on every calf in town!\\"It was doubtful if Mr. Hedrick intended a reference to the maternal instinct.","It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.","He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy\'s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.","Her bedroom had seemed so pink and young and delicate, appropriate to her pastel-shaded lingerie tossed here and there on chair and bed.","Tom, I hope something happens. I\'m restless as the devil and have a horror of getting fat or falling in love and growing domestic.","She told him in a dozen ways, of which the best was without words, how she had missed him. Her emotion reassured him, promised his anxious heart that everything would be all right\\".","His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was","Just as he still cared more for her than for any other creature, so did he more intensely and frequently hate her.","For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man\u2019s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever","Their eyes met, locked, became wistful, and dreamy and beautiful.","There\'s no beauty without poignancy and there\'s no poignancy without the feeling that it\'s going, men, names, books, houses - bound for dust - mortal.","Then she kissed him until the sky seemed to fade out and all her smiles and tears to vanish in an ecstasy of eternal seconds.","One thin\'s sure and nothing\'s surerThe rich get richer and the poor get \u2014 children.In the meantime,In between time...","The reaction came when he realized the waste and extravagance involved. He somtimes looked back with awe at the carnivals of affection he had given, as a general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood lust.","It is youth\u2019s felicity as well as its insufficiency that it can never live in the present, but must always be measuring up the day against its own radiantly imagined future - flowers and gold, girls and stars, they are only prefigurations and prophecies of that incomparable, unattainable young dream.","It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.","It never ocurred to him that he was a passive thing, acted upon by an influence above and beyond Gloria, that he was merely the sensitive plate on which the photograph was made. Some gargantuan photographer had focused the camera on Gloria and Snap! - the poor plate could but develop, confined like all things to its nature.","There!\\" she said, as she spread the tablecloth and put the sandwiches in a neat pile upon it. \\"Don\'t they look tempting? I always think that food tastes better outdoors.\\"With that remark,\\" remarked Kismine, \\"Jasmine enters the Middle class.","It is in the twenties that the actual momentum of life begins to slacken, and it is a simple soul indeed to whom as many things are significant and meaningful at thirty as at ten years before. At thirty an organ-grinder is a more or less moth-eaten man who grinds an organ \u2014 and once he was an organ-grinder! The unmistakable stigma of humanity touches all those impersonal and beautiful things that only youth ever grasps in their impersonal glory. A brilliant ball, gay with light romantic laughter, wears through its own silks and satins to show the bare framework of a man-made thing \u2014 oh, that eternal hand!\u2014 a play, most tragic and most divine, becomes merely a succession of speeches, sweated over by the eternal plagiarist in the clammy hours and acted by men subject to cramps, cowardice, and manly sentiment.","It had seemed as close as a star to the moon.","Want any of this stuff? Jordan?... Nick?\\"I didn\'t answer.Nick?\\" he asked again.What?\\"Want any?\\"No... I just remembered that today\'s my birthday.\\"I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade.","You\'re very polite, but I belong to another generation","Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?","The price for his intactness was incompleteness.","So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road-house next door.","Incessantly she puzzled him: one hour so intimate and charming, striving desperately toward an unguessed, transcendent union; the next, silent and cold, apparently unmoved by any consideration of their love or anything he could say.","He smiled understandingly-much more than understanding. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.","I used to wonder why they kept princesses in towers","It\'s worse in the case of newspapers. Any rich, unprogressive old party with that particularly grasping, acquisitive form of mentality known as financial genius can own a paper that is the intellectual meat and drink of thousands of tired, hurried men, men too involved in the business of modern living to swallow anything but predigested food.\\" p. 201","Each night when she prepared for bed she smeared her face with some new unguent which she hoped illogically would give back the glow and freshness to her vanishing beauty.","I knew that what was left of me would always love you, but never in quite the same way.","So things go","At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain - as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.","There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams -- not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.","Whenever you feel like criticising any one, just remember that all of the people in the world haven\'t had the advantages that you\'ve had.","Its nothing,\' said Horace quietly, \'but if you can think of any nicer way of a man killing himself than taking a risk for you, why that\'s the way I want to die.","There\'s a loneliness that only exists in one\'s mind. The loneliest moment in someone\'s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart and all they can do is stare blankly.","Amory Blaine inherited from his mother every trait, except the stray inexpressible few, that made him worth while.","Such a pretty girl- to say such wise things.","I read somewhere that the sun\'s getting hotter every year,\\" said Tom genially. \\"It seems that pretty soon the earth\'s going to fall into the sun--or wait a minute--it\'s just the opposite--the sun\'s getting colder every year.\\" 1925","There was a hint in the air that the earth was hurrying on toward other weather; the lush midsummer moment outside of time was already over.","He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass.","Long after midnight the towers and spires of Princeton were visible, with here and there a late-burning light \u2013 and suddenly out of the clear darkness the sound of bells. As an endless dream it went on; the spirit of the past brooding over a new generation, the chosen youth from the muddled, unchastened world, still fed romantically on the mistakes and half-forgotten dreams of dead statesmen and poets. Here was a new generation, shouting the old cries, learning the old creeds, through a reverie of long days and nights, destined finally to go out into the dirty grey turmoil to follow love and pride; a new generation dedicated more than the last to the fear of poverty and the worship of success; grown up to find all God\u2019s dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken\u2026","With people like us our home is where we are not.","She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.","He was wondering at the unreality of ideas, at the fading radiance of existence, and at the little absorptions that were creeping avidly into his life, like rats into a ruined house","The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through.","I\u2019ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything\u2026Sophisticated \u2014 God, I\u2019m sophisticated! (Daisy)","Their hands touched for an instant, but neither spoke. Silences were becoming more frequent and more delicious.","Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction -- Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn ... No -- Gatsby turned out all right in the end; it was what prayed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and the short-winded elations of men.","I like temperamental men.\' \'There aren\'t any. Men don\'t know how to be really angry or really happy-- and the ones that do, go to pieces.","You\'re not sentimental?\' \'No, I\'m romantic-- a sentimental person thinks things will last-- a romantic person hopes against hope that they won\'t. Sentiment is emotional.","There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler\u2019s thumb.","He wondered idly whether she was a poor conversationalist because she got no attention or got no attention because she was a poor conversationalist.","After marriage came elation, and then, gradually, the growth of weariness. Responsibility descended upon Merlin, the responsibility of making his thirty dollars a week and her twenty suffice to keep them respectably fat and to hide with decent garments the evidence that they were.","Her hair, drawn back off her ears, brushed her shoulders in such a way that the face seemed to have just emerged from it, as if this were the exact moment when she was coming from a wood into clear moonlight. The unknown yielded her up; Dick wished she had no background, that she was just a girl lost with no address save the night from which she had come.","This is not a time for hereos because nobody will let it happen","I was looking at it again, through Daisy\u2019s eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.","I saw that for a long time I had not liked people and things, but only followed the rickety old pretense of liking. I saw that even my love for those closest to me was become only an attempt to love, that my casual relations \u2014 with an editor, a tobacco seller, the child of a friend, were only what I remembered I should do, from other days.","The tears coursed down her cheeks- not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets.","Was everyone followed in the moonlight?","I always watch for the longest day in the year and then I miss it.","Cuando sientas deseos de criticar a alguien -fueron sus palabras- \u201crecuerda que no todo el mundo ha tenido las mismas oportunidades que t\xfa tuviste.\u201d","Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan scornful mouth smiled and I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.","We\'re going through the black air with our arms wide and our feet straight out behind like a dolphin\'s tail, and we\'re going to think we\'ll never hit the silver down there till suddenly it\'ll be all warm round us and full of little kissing, caressing waves.","Don\u2019t ever phone if you can possibly come yourself. Don\u2019t ever leave if you can stay.","You will admit that if it was not life it was magnificent.","I suppose all great happiness is a little sad. Beauty means the scent of roses and then the death of roses\u2014","There was the starlight set upon the brilliant darkness; and there were her pale cool cheeks, and he let himself be lost in love for her, as he had so wanted to do.","Had they nothing else to say to each other? Yet their eyes were full of more serious statements; and while they sought for commonplace sentences, they each felt the same languor. It was like a murmur of the soul, profound and continuous, dominating that of the voices. Surprised at this unexpected sweetness, it did not occur to them to discuss the sensation or discover the cause. Future happiness, like tropical shores, projects over the vastness that precedes it, its innate indolence, and wafts a scented breeze that intoxicates and dispels any anxiety about the unseen horizon.","Always, after he was in bed, there were voices - indefinite, fading, enchanting - just outside his window, and before he fell asleep he would dream one of his favorites waking dreams.","Involuntarily I glanced seaward and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby, he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.","hat a feeble thing intelligence is, with its short steps, its waverings, its pacings back and forth, its disastrous retreats! Intelligence is a mere instrument of circumstances. There are people who say that intelligence must have built the universe\u2014why, intelligence never built a steam engine! Circumstances built a steam engine. Intelligence is little more than a short foot-rule by which we measure the infinite achievements of Circumstances.","And she wanted for a moment to hold and devour him, wanted his mouth, his ears, his coat collar, wanted to surround him and engulf him\u2026","Bao gi\u1edd m\xe0 ch\u1eb3ng th\u1ea5y bu\u1ed3n khi nh\xecn l\u1ea1i nh\u1eefng g\xec m\xecnh \u0111\xe3 qu\xe1 quen thu\u1ed9c b\u1eb1ng m\u1ed9t con m\u1eaft kh\xe1c.","Now you\'ve a clean start... you\'ve brushed three or four ornaments down, and in a fit of pique knocked off the rest of them. The thing now is to collect some new ones, and the farther you look ahead in the collecting, the better, but remember, do the next thing.","...for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.","The very qualities I love you for are the ones that will always make you a failure.","Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night. \u201cGod sees everything, repeated Wilson.\u201d","I\'m one of those people who go through the world giving other people thrills but getting few myself except those I read into men on nights such as these.","That\u2019s going to be your trouble \u2014 judgment about yourself.(Tender is the Night)","\u038c\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c3\' \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03c7\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c3\u03cd.","I love New York on summer afternoons when every one\'s away. There\'s something very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.","You see, when you were little they kept sending me snap\u2013shots of you, first as a baby and then as a child in socks playing on the beach with a pail and shovel, and then suddenly as a wistful little girl with wondering, pure eyes\u2014and I used to build dreams about you. A man has to have something living to cling to. I think, Lois, it was your little white soul I tried to keep near me\u2014even when life was at its loudest and every intellectual idea of God seemed the sheerest mockery, and desire and love and a million things came up to me and said: \'Look here at me! See, I\'m Life. You\'re turning your back on it!\' All the way through that shadow, Lois, I could always see your baby soul flitting on ahead of me, very frail and clear and wonderful.","We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. ...","Daddy\'s girl. Was it a \'itty-bitty bravekins and did it suffer?

Before her tiny fist the forces of lust and corruption rolled away; nay, the very march of destiny stopped; inevitably became inevitable, syllogism, dialectic, all rationality fell away","The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the treas and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life.","And courage to me meant ploughing through that dull gray mist that comes down on life--not only overriding people and circumstances but overriding the bleakness of living.","no girl can permanently bolster up a lame-duck visitor, because these day it\'s every girl for herself.","My hair-- bob it!","But I hate to get anywhere by working for it. I\'ll show the marks, don\'t you know.","He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.","He tries to go to life. So does every author except the very worst, but after all most of them live on predigested food. The incident or character may be from life, but the writer usually interprets it in terms of the last book he read. For instance, suppose he meets a sea captain and thinks he\'s an original character. The truth is that he sees the resemblance between the sea captain and the last sea captain Dana created, or who-ever creates sea captains, and therefore he knows how to set this sea captain on paper","The bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine who \'felt just as good on nothing at all.\' Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.","I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn\'t believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream, He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is...","You\'ll notice a blond person is expected to talk. If a blond girl doesn\'t talk we call her a \'doll\'; if a light-haired man is silent he\'s considered stupid. Yet the world is full of \'dark silent men\' and \'languorous brunettes\' who haven\'t a brain in their heads, but somehow are never accused of the dearth.","You said a bad driver is only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn\'t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.","I could never be a Communist. I could never be regimented. I could never be told what to write.","Life opened up in one if its amazing bursts of radiance and Amory suddenly and permanently rejected an old epigram that had been playing listlessly in his mind: \'Very few things matter and nothing matters very much.\' On the contrary, Amory felt an immense desire to give people a sense of security.","Begin with an individual, and before you know it you find that you have created a type: begin with a type, and you find that you have created - nothing. That is because we are all queer fish, queerer behind our faces and voices than we want anyone to know or than we know ourselves.","Out of the deep sophistication of Anthony an understanding formed, nothing atavistic or obscure, indeed scarcely physical at all, an understanding remembered from the romancings of many generations of minds that as she talked and caught his eyes and turned her lovely head, she moved him as he had never been moved before. The sheath that held her soul had assumed significance- that was all. She was a sun, radiant, growing, gathering light and storing it- then after an eternity pouring it forth in a glance, the fragment of a sentence, to that part of him that cherished all beauty and all illusion.","Sudden revulsion seized Amory, disgust, loathing for the whole incident. He desired frantically to be away, never to see Myra again, never to kiss anyone; he became conscious of his face and hers, of their clinging hands, and he wanted to creep out of his body and hide somewhere safe out of sight, up in the corner of his mind.","Fatigue was a drug as well as a poison, and Stahr apparently derived some rare almost physical pleasure from working lightheaded with weariness.","there\'s no beauty without poignancy and there\'s no poignancy without the feeling that it\'s going, men, names, books, houses--bound for dust--mortal--\\"a small boy appeared beside them and, swinging a handful of banana peels, flung them valiantly in the direction of the potomac.","And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler.","When you\'re older you\'ll know what people who love suffer. The agony. It\'s better to be cold and young than to love.","It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply.","While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion.","I\'m very damn wet!\' he said aloud to the sundial.","Beware of losing yourself in the personality of another being, man or woman.","Amory, sorry for them, was still not sorry for himself - art, politics, religion, whatever his medium should be, he knew he was safe now, free from all hysteria - he could accept what was acceptable, roam, grow, rebel, sleep deep through many nights...There was no God in his heart, he knew; his ideas were still in riot; there was ever the pain of memory; the regret for his lost youth - yet the waters of disillusion had left a deposit on his soul, responsibility and a love of life, the faint stirring of old ambitions and unrealized dreams...And he could not tell why the struggle was worth while, why he had determined to use to the utmost himself and his heritage from the personalities he had passed...He stretched out his arms to the crystalline, radiant sky.\\"I know myself,\\" he cried, \\"but that is all.","Most of the big shore places were closed now. And there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of the ferryboat across the sound. And as the moon rose higher, the inessential houses began to melt away till gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors\u2019 eyes, A fresh green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams. For a transitory, enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent. Face to face, for the last time in history, with something commensurate to its capacity for wonder.","Like so many men he had found that he had only one or two ideas - that his little collection of pamphlets now in its fiftieth German edition contained the germ of all he would ever think or know.","McKisco\'s contacts with the princely classes in America had impressed upon him their uncertain and fumbling snobbery, their delight in ignorance and their deliberate rudeness, all lifted from the English with no regard paid to factors that make English philistinism and rudeness purposeful, and applied in a land where a little knowledge and civility buy more than they do anywhere else - an attitude which reached its apogee in the \\"Harvard manner\\" of about 1900.","A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.","He drew her very tenderly close and their lips met like starved hearts.","I have lived so long within the circle of this book and with these characters that often it seems to me that the real world does not exist but that only these characters exist, and however pretentious that remark sounds... it is an absolute fact-- so much so that their glees and woes are just exactly as important to me as what happens in life.","Cuando yo era m\xe1s joven y m\xe1s vulnerable, mi padre me dio un consejo en el que no he dejado de pensar desde entonces.\xabAntes de criticar a nadie\xbb, me dijo, \xabrecuerda que no todo el mundo ha tenido las ventajas que has tenido t\xfa.\xbb","He had never met a girl like this before - she would never seem quite the same again. He didn\'t at all feel like a character in a play, the appropriate feeling in an unconventional situation - instead, he had a sense of coming home.","The siren soared again, closer at hand, and then, with no anticipatory roar and clamour, a dark and sinuous body curved into view against the shadows far down the high-banked track, and with no sound but the rush of the cleft wind and the clock like tick of the rails, moved towards the bridge - it was an electric train. Above the engine two vivid blurs of blue light formed incessantly a radiant crackling bar between them, which, like a spluttering flame in a lamp beside a corpse, lit for an instant the successive rows of trees and caused Gloria to draw back instinctively to the far side of the road. The light was tepid - the temperature of warm blood... The clicking blended suddenly with itself in a rush of even sound, and then, elongating in sombre elasticity, the thing roared blindly by her and thundered onto the bridge, racing the lurid shaft of fire it cast into the solemn river alongside. Then it contracted swiftly, sucking in its sound until it left only a reverberant echo, which died upon the farther bank.","Unlike lovers they possessed no past; unlike man and wife, they possessed no future; yet up to in this morning Nicole had liked Abe better than anyone except Dick--and he had been heavy, belly-frightened, with love for her for years.","He felt that he was leaving behind him his chance of being a certain type of artist. It seemed so much more important to be a certain sort of man.","He was born sleepless, without a talent for rest or the desire for it.","Biography is the falsest of the arts.","Afterwards, he just sat, happy to live in the past. The drink made past happy things contemporary with the present, as if they were still going on, contemporary even with the future as if they were about to happen again.","At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness","She was entertained only by the gratification of her desires and by the direct exercise of her own charm.","Cada vez que creas que tienes que criticar a alguien\\", me dijo, \\"solo recuerda que no toda la gente de este mundo ha contado con las ventajas de que t\xfa has gozado\\".","Begin with an individual, and before you know it you find that you have created a type; begin with a type, and you find that you have created\u2014nothing. That is because we are all queer fish, queerer behind our faces and voices than we want any one to know or than we know ourselves. When I hear a man proclaiming himself an \\"average, honest, open fellow,\\" I feel pretty sure that he has some definite and perhaps terrible abnormality which he has agreed to conceal\u2014and his protestation of being average and honest and open is his way of reminding himself of his misprision.","A sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.","She was about twenty-four, Rosemary guessed - her face could have been described in terms of conventional prettiness, but the effect was that it had been made first on the heroic scale with strong structure and marking, as if the features and vividness of brow and coloring, everything we associate with temperament and character had been molded with a Rodinesque intention, and then chiseled away in the direction of prettiness to a point where a single slip would have irreparably diminished its force and quality. With the mouth the sculptor had taken desperate chances - it was the cupid\'s bow of a magazine cover, yet it shared the distinction of the rest.","But to be included in Dick Diver\u2019s world for a while was a remarkable experience: people believed he made special reservations about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many years. He won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration and a politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that it could be examined only in its effect. Then, without caution, lest the first bloom of the relation wither, he opened the gate to his amusing world. So long as they subscribed to it completely, their happiness was his preoccupation, but at the first flicker of doubt as to its all- inclusiveness he evaporated before their eyes, leaving little communicable memory of what he had said or done.","She hated the beach, resented the places where she had played planet to Dick\'s sun.","Writers aren\'t exactly people.They\'re a whole lot of people,trying to be one person.","We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn\'t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.","Quando te sentires com vontade de criticar algu\xe9m, lembra-te disto: nem todos tiveram neste mundo as vantagens que tu tiveste.","Do you believe in bobbed hair?\\" asked G. Reece in the same undertone. \\"I think it\'s unmoral,\\" affirmed Bernice gravely. \\"But, of course, you\'ve either got to amuse people or feed\'em or shock\'em.","Their point of resemblance to each other and their difference from so many American women, lay in the fact that they were all happy to exist in a man\'s world--they preserved their individuality through men and not by opposition to them. They would all three have made alternatively good courtesans or good wives not by the accident of birth but through the greater accident of finding their man or not finding him.","Under the glass porte-coch\xe8re of a theatre Amory stood, watching the first great drops of rain splatter down and flatten to dark stains on the sidewalk. The air became grey and opalescent; a solitary light suddenly outlined a window over the way; then another light; then a hundred more danced and glimmered into vision. Under his feet a thick, iron-studded skylight turned yellow; in the street the lamps of the taxicabs sent out glistening sheens along the already black pavement. The unwelcome November rain had perversely stolen the day\u2019s last hour and pawned it with that ancient fence, the night.","Simultaneously the whole party moved toward the water, super-ready from the long, forced inaction, passing from the heat to the cool with the gourmandise of a tingling curry eaten with chilled white wine.","They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.","An idea ran backward and forward in his head like a blind man, knocking over the solid furniture.","And with the clumsy tools of jealousy and desire, he was trying to create the spell that is ethereal and delicate as the dust on a moth\'s wing","It\'d be a good setting to jump overboard,\' said Dick mildly.\'Wouldn\'t it?\' agreed Nicole hastily. \'Let\'s borrow life-preservers and jump over. I think we should do something spectacular. I feel that all our lives have been too restrained.","he had made his choice, chosen Ophelia, chosen the sweet poison and drunk it. Wanting above all to brave and kind, he had wanted, even more than that, to be loved. So it had been. So it would ever be\u2026","He shut the door and coming back into the room stood for a moment lost in thought with the tennis ball still clasped in his hand. There was one of his lonelinesses coming, one of those times when he walked the streets or sat, aimless and depressed, biting a pencil at his desk. It was a self-absorption with no comfort, a demand for expression with no outlet, a sense of time rushing by, ceaselessly and wastefully\u2014assuaged only by that conviction that there was nothing to waste, because all efforts and attainments were equally valueless.","I want to write something new - something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.As usual, F. Scott Fitzgerald","Fifteen years of yes\'s had beaten Mrs. Gilbert. Fifteen further years of that incessant unaffirmative affirmative, accompanied by the perpetual flicking of ash-mushrooms from thirty-two thousand cigars, had broken her. To this husband of hers she made the last concession of married life, which is more complete, more irrevocable, than the first\u2014she listened to him. She told herself that the years had brought her tolerance\u2014actually they had slain what measure she had ever possessed of moral courage.","It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man , more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road. \'How do you get to West Egg village?\' he asked helplessly. I told him. Ans as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He has casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.","Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names \u2014 Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.","It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply\u2014I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man\u2019s coat.\u201cYou\u2019re a rotten driver, I protested. \u201cEither you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn\u2019t to drive at all.\u201d\u201cI am careful.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d\u201cWell, other people are,\u201d she said lightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with it?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll keep out of my way,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIt takes two to make an accident.\u201d\u201cSuppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\u201d\u201cI hope I never will,\u201d she answered. \u201cI hate careless people. That\u2019s why I like you.\u201dHer gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I\u2019d been writing letters once a week and signing them: \u201cLove, Nick,\u201d and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\u201d","Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby\'s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.","The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.\'I\'m p-paralyzed with happiness.\'She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I\'ve heard it said that Daisy\'s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)","I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered \'Listen,\' a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.","In two weeks it\'ll be the longest day in the year.\' She looked at us all radiantly. \'Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.\'\'We ought to plan something,\' yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.\'All right,\' said Daisy. \'What\'ll we plan?\' She turned to me helplessly. \'What do people plan?","Deepest of all in her personality was the golden radiance that she diffused around her. As an open fire in a dark room throws romance and pathos into the quiet faces at its edge, so she cast her lights and shadows around the rooms that held her.","This is a valley of ashes - a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and riding smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.","I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn\'t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn\'t lay eyes on him again for over four years--even after I\'d met him on Long Island I didn\'t realize it was the same man.","You are bound to go up and down, just as I did in my youth, but do keep your clarity of mind, and if fools or sages dare to criticise don\'t blame yourself too much.","Misfortune is liable to make me a damn bad man","One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil","Think of all the fine men we should lose is suicide were not so cowardly","There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year\'s shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.","The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens - finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run.","Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.","He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn\'t realize just how extraordinary a \'nice\' girl could be.","I can\'t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she\'d throw me over, but she didn\'t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her.","He felt that if he had a love he would have hung her picture just facing the tub so that, lost in the soothing steamings of the hot water, he might lie and look up at her and muse warmly and sensuously on her beauty.","I\'d rather keep it as a beautiful memory-- tucked away in my heart.\' \'Yes, women can do that-- but not men. I\'d remember always, not the beauty of it while it lasted, but just the bitterness, the long bitterness.\' \'Don\'t!","I think one thing today and another tomorrow. That is really all that\'s the matter with me, except a crazy defiance and a lack of proportion.","He felt persistently that the girl was beautiful- then of a sudden he understood: it was her distance, not a rare and precious distance of soul but still distance, if only in terrestrial yards.","I matched my grey eyes against his brown ones for guile, my young golf-and-tennis heart-beats against his, which must be slowing a little after years of over-work. And I planned and I contrived and I plotted - any woman can tell you - but it never came to anything, as you will see. I still like to think that if he\'d been a poor boy and nearer my age I could manage it, but of course the real truth was that I had nothing to offer that he didn\'t have.","Just as a cooling pot gives off heat, so all through youth and adolescence we give off calories of virtue. That\'s what\'s called ingenuousness.","Yet how bored they both looked, and how wearily Ethel regarded Jim sometimes, as if she wondered why she had trained the vines of her affection on such a wind-shaken poplar.","He cared only about people; he was scarcely conscious of places except for their weather, until they had been invested with color by tangible events.","L\'intimit\xe0 si crea cos\xec. Prima si d\xe0 il miglior ritratto di se stesso, un prodotto splendente e rifinito, ritoccato di vanterie e falsit\xe0 e umorismi. Poi diventano necessari i particolari e si dipinge un secondo ritratto e poi un terzo... In breve i lineamenti migliori si cancellano... e finalmente si rivela il segreto: i piani dei ritratti si sono mescolati e ci hanno tradito, e per quanto continuiamo a dipingere non riusciamo pi\xf9 a vendere un quadro.","Life rose around my island like a sea, and presently I was swimming.","The sea, he thought, had treasured its memories deeper than the faithless land.","No- Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it was what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and the short-winded elations of men.","I reached maturity under the impression that I was gathering the experience to order my life for happiness. Indeed, I accomplished the not unusual feat of solving each question in my mind long before it presented itself to me in life\u2014and of being beaten and bewildered just the same.","that illusion of young romantic love to which women look forever forward and forever back.","I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the \u201cwell-rounded man.

Do you want to hear about the butler\u2019s nose?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I came over to-night.\u201d","I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon\u2026","I\'ve found my line- from now on this comes first. This is my immediate duty- without this I am nothing.","Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, he told me, \u201cjust remember that all the people in this world haven\u2019t had the advantages that you\u2019ve had.\u201d","It was midsummer, but fresh water from the gasping sprinklers made the lawn glitter like spring.","His voice, with some faint Irish melody running through it, wooed the world, yet she felt the layer of hardness in him, of self-control and of self-discipline, her own virtues. Oh, she chose him, and Nicole, lifting her head saw her choose him, heard a little sigh at the fact that he was already possessed.","After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby\'s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world.","A lonesome town, though. He who had grown up alone had lately learned to avoid solitude. During the past several months he had been careful, when he had no engagement for the evening, to hurry to one of his clubs and find someone. Oh there was a loneliness here--","Once upon a time all the men of mind and genius in the world became of one belief\u2014that is to say, of no belief. But it wearied them to think that within a few years after their death many cults and systems and prognostications would be ascribed to them which they had never meditated nor intended. So they said to one another: \\"\'Let\'s join together and make a great book that will last forever to mock the credulity of man. Let\'s persuade our more erotic poets to write about the delights of the flesh, and induce some of our robust journalists to contribute stories of famous amours. We\'ll include all the most preposterous old wives\' tales now current. We\'ll choose the keenest satirist alive to compile a deity from all the deities worshipped by mankind, a deity who will be more magnificent than any of them, and yet so weakly human that he\'ll become a byword for laughter the world over\u2014and we\'ll ascribe to him all sorts of jokes and vanities and rages, in which he\'ll be supposed to indulge for his own diversion, so that the people will read our book and ponder it, and there\'ll be no more nonsense in the world. \\"\'Finally, let us take care that the book possesses all the virtues of style, so that it may last forever as a witness to our profound scepticism and our universal irony.\' \\"So the men did, and they died. \\"But the book lived always, so beautifully had it been written, and so astounding the quality of imagination with which these men of mind and genius had endowed it. They had neglected to give it a name, but after they were dead it became known as the Bible.","Tangled with love in the moonlight she welcomed the anarchy of her lover.","It was all very purposeful and sad when Anthony told Gloria one night that he wanted, above all things, to be killed. But, as always, they were sorry for each other for the wrong things at the wrong time...","Dick tried to plunge over the Alpine crevasse between the sexes.","It was astonishing to think that life had once been the sum of her current love-affairs. It was now the sum of her current problems.","No one likes to see people in moods of despair they themselves have survived.","In fact to write (This Side of Paradise) took three months; to conceive it-- three minutes; to collect the data in it-- all my life.","There\'s no \'Safety First\' in Art.","They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people cleanup the mess they had made . . .","Each life unfulfilled, you see, \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It hangs still, patchy and scrappy; \xa0\xa0\xa0 We have not sighed deep, laughed free, \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Starved, feasted, despaired\u2014been happy.\\" But his life","This was his healthy state and it made him cheerful, pleasant, and very attractive to intelligent men and to all women. In this state he considered that he would one day accomplish some quiet subtle thing that the elect would deem worthy and, passing on, would join the dimmer stars in a nebulous, indeterminate heaven half-way between death and immortality. Until the time came for this effort he would be Anthony Patch\u2014not a portrait of a man but a distinct and dynamic personality, opinionated, contemptuous, functioning from within outward\u2014a man who was aware that there could be no honor and yet had honor, who knew the sophistry of courage and yet was brave.","I\'m not sure what I\'ll do, but-well, I want to go places and see people. I want my mind to grow. I want to live where things happen on a big scale.","He saw Kathleen sitting in the middle of a long white table alone.Immediately things changed. As he walked toward her the people shrank back against the walls till they were only murals; the white table lengthened and became an altar where the priestess sat alone. Vitality welled up in him and he could have stood a long time across the table from her, looking and smiling.","He was changed as completely as Amory Blaine could ever be changed. Amory plus Beatrice plus two years in Minneapolis - these had been his ingredients when he entered St. Regis\'. But the Minneapolis years were not a thick enough overlay to conceal the \\"Amory plus Beatrice\\" from the ferreting eyes of a boarding school, so St. Regis\' had very painfully drilled Beatrice out of him and begun to lay down new and more conventional planking on the fundamental Amory. But both St. Regis\' and Amory were unconscious of the fact that this fundamental Amory had not in himself changed. Those qualities for which he had suffered: his moodiness, his tendency to pose, his laziness, and his love of playing the fool, were now taken as a matter of course, recognized eccentricities in a star quarter-back, a clever actor, and the editor of the \\"St. Regis\' Tattler\\"; it puzzled him to see impressionable small boys imitating the very vanities that had not long ago been contemptible weaknesses.","Oh, he was a pretentious fool, making careers out of cocktails and meanwhile regretting, weakly and secretly, the collapse of an insufficient and wretched idealism. He had garnished his soul in the subtlest taste and now he longed for the old rubbish. He was empty, it seemed, empty as an old bottle \u2014","and he suddenly realized the meaning of the word \'dissipate\' -- to dissipate into thin air; to make nothing out of something. In the little hours of the night every move from place to place was an enormous human jump, an increase of paying for the privilege of slower and slower motion.","At both ends of life man needed nourishment: a breast - a shrine. Something to lay himself beside when no one wanted him further, and shoot a bullet into his head.","All the bright precious things fade so fast.","One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees - he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the imcomparable milk of wonder.","A precocious mistress of the long look, the sustained smile, the private voice and the delicate touch, devices of generations","Nevertheless, his very superiority kept him from being a success in college--the independence was mistaken for egotism, and the refusal to accept Yale standards with the proper awe seemed to belittle all those who had.","She had achieved the elusiveness that gives hidden significance to the least significant remarks.\u201cIs it like you felt toward me in Paris?\u201cI feel comfortable and happy when I\u2019m with you. In Paris it was different. But you never know how you once felt. Do you?\u201d","\u2026a neglig\xe9e of robin\'s-egg blue laid out upon the bed diffused a faint perfume, elusive and familiar. On a chair were a pair of stockings and a street dress; an open powder box yawned upon the bureau. She had gone out.","Receding from a grief, it seems necessary to retrace the same steps that brought us there.","You see I think everything\'s terrible anyhow. Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I know. I\'ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything. Sophisticated--God, I\'m sophisticated!","Don\'t you want to preserve old things?But you can\'t, Anthony. Beautiful things grow to a certain height and then they fail and fade off, breathing out memories as they decay. And just as any period decays in our minds, the things of that period should decay too, and in that way they\'re preserved for a while in the few hearts like mine that react to them. That graveyard at Tarrytown, for instance. The asses who give money to preserve things have spoiled that too. Sleepy Hollow\'s gone; Washington Irving\'s dead and his books are rotting in our estimation year by year - then let the graveyard rot too, as it should, as all things should. Trying to preserve a century by keeping its relics up to date is like keeping a dying man alive by stimulants.So you think that just as time goes to pieces its houses ought to go too?Of course! Would you value your Keats letter if the signature was traced over to make it last longer? It\'s just because I love the past that I want this house to look back on its glamorous moment of youth and beauty, and I want its stars to creak as if to the footsteps of women with hoop-skirts and men in boots and spurs. But they\'ve made it into a blondined, rouged-up old woman of sixty. It hasn\'t any right to look so prosperous. It might care enough for Lee to drop a brick now and then. How many of these - these animals - get anything from this, for all the histories and guide-books and restorations in existence? How many of them who think that, at best, appreciation is talking in undertones and walking on tiptoes would even come here if it was any trouble? I want it to smell of magnolias instead of peanuts and I want my shoes to crunch on the same gravel that Lee\'s boots crunched on. There\'s no beauty without poignancy and there\'s no poignancy without the feeling that it\'s going, men, names, books, houses - bound for dust - mortal-","Celtic you\'ll live and Celtic you\'ll die.","...he told me all the things he liked to THINK he thought in the misty past.","My mind, brightened by the lights and the cheerful tumult, suddenly grasped the fact that all achievement was a placing of emphasis-- a moulding of the confusion of life into form.","You seem to be bankrupt - morally as well as financially","It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people- with the single mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.","The grass is full of ghosts tonight.\' \'The whole campus is alive with them.\' They paused by Little and watched the moon rise, to make silver of the slate roof of Dodd and blue the rustling trees. \'You know,\' whispered Tom, \'what we feel now is the sense of all the gorgeous youth that has rioted through here in two hundred years.","Benjamin started; an almost chemical change seemed to dissolve and recompose the very elements of his body. A rigour passed over him, blood rose into his cheeks, his forehead, and there was a steady thumping in his ears. It was first love.","The war spirit\'s getting into me again. I have a hundred years of Ohio love behind me and I\'m going to bomb out this trench.","the heterogeneous indistinguishable mass of college boys, interested only in love at first sight,...","The logic of the suggestion fitted gradually into Abe\u2019s pitch \u2013 he grew rather enthusiastic about being cared for, or rather about prolonging his state of irresponsibility.","It always astonishes me when anybody does anything","He stretched out his arms towards the dark water in a curious way, and,far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling involuntarily I glanced seaward - and distinguishing nothing except a single green light, minute and faraway, that might have been the end of a dock.","That\'s my theory: immediate electrocution of all ignorant and dirty people.

And if you find that you\u2019re not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again. - The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\u201d","If you hated me, if you were covered with sores like a leper, if you ran away with another woman or starved me or beat me\u2014how absurd this sounds\u2014I\'d still want you, I\'d still love you.

At the same time, I am not going to encourage you about it, because, after all, if you want to get into the big time, you have to have your own fences to jump and learn from experience. Nobody ever became a writer just by wanting to be one. If you have anything to say, anything you feel nobody has ever said before, you have got to feel it so desperately that you will find some way to say it that nobody has ever found before, so that the thing you have to say and the way of saying it blend as one matter - as indissolubly as if they were conceived together. Let me preach again for a moment: I mean that what you have felt and thought will by itself invent a new style, so that when people talk about style they are always a little astonished at the newness of it, because they think that it is only style that they are talking about, when what they are talking about is the attempt to express a new idea with such force that it will have the originality of the thought. It is an awfully lonesome business, and as you know, I never wanted you to go into it, but if you are going into it at all I want you to go into it knowing the sort of things that took me years to learn.","As he held her and tasted her, and she curved in further and further toward him, with her own lips, new to herself, drowned and engulfed in love, yet solaced and triumphant, he was thankful to have an existence at all, if only as a reflection in her wet eyes.","I saw that for a long time I had not liked people and things, but only followed the rickety old pretense of liking. I saw that even my love for those closest to me had become only an attempt to love, that my casual relations -- with an editor, a tobacco seller, the child of a friend, were only what I remembered I should do, from other days. All in the same month I became bitter about such things as the sound of the radio, the advertisements in the magazines, the screech of tracks, the dead silence of the country -- contemptuous at human softness, immediately (if secretively) quarrelsome toward hardness -- hating the night when I couldn\'t sleep and hating the day because it went toward night. I slept on the heart side now because I knew that the sooner I could tire that out, even a little, the sooner would come that blessed hour of nightmare which, like a catharsis, would enable me to better meet the new day.","A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up towards the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.","Note also in the epilogue that I want to show that Stahr left certain harm behind him just as he left good behind him.","Trouble is when you\u2019re sober you don\u2019t want to see anybody, and when you\u2019re tight nobody wants to see you.","They were so sorry, dear; they went down to meet each other in a taxi, honey; they had preferences in smiles and had met in Hindustan, and shortly afterward they must have quarrelled, for nobody knew and nobody seemed to care - yet finally one of them had gone and left the other crying, only to feel blue, to feel sad.","One night they walked while the moon rose and poured a great burden of glory over the garden until it seemed fairyland with Amory and Eleanor, dim phantasmal shapes, expressing eternal beauty and curious elfin love moods. Then they turned out of the moonlight into the trellised darkness of a vine-hung pagoda, where there were scents so plaintive as to be nearly musical.","Some men escape the grip. Maybe their wives have no social ambitions; maybe they\'ve hit a sentence or two in a \'dangerous book\' that pleased them; maybe they started on the treadmill as I did and were knocked off.

Mine is that I\'m against the burning of witches. Whenever they burn a witch I get all hot under the collar.","But he knew that he was in Daisy\'s house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously - eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand","Her sigh was a benediction\u2014an ecstatic surety that she was youth and beauty now as much as she would ever know.

Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.","There is something awe-inspiring in one who has lost all inhibitions, who will do anything.

It\'s impossible to make much of that interesting on the screen.\'\'You want plots first,\' said Richard brilliantly.\'Of course. Plots first\u2014\' He paused, shifted his gaze. His pause spread, included the others with all the authority of a warning finger. Gloria followed by Rachael was coming out of the dressing room.","he was safe in here from all the threat of life...","All the way back she talked haltingly about herself, and Amory\'s love waned slowly with the moon. At her door they started from habit to kiss good night, but she could not run into his arms, nor were they stretched to meet her as in the week before. For a minute they stood there, hating each other with a bitter sadness. But as Amory had loved himself in Eleanor, so now what he hated was only a mirror. Their poses were strewn about the pale dawn like broken glass. The stars were long gone and there were left only the little sighing gusts of wind and the silences between... but naked souls are poor things ever, and soon he turned homewards and let new lights come in with the sun.","I have to be won all over again every time you see me","God, am I like the rest after all? \u2014 So he used to think starting awake at night \u2014 \u201cAm I like the rest?\u201dThis was poor material for a socialist but good material for those who do much of the world\u2019s rarest work. The truth was that for some months he had been going through that partitioning of the things of youth wherein it is decided whether or not to die for what one no longer believes. In the dead white hours in Zurich staring into a stranger\'s pantry across the upshine of a street-lamp, he used to think that he wanted to be good, he wanted to be kind, he wanted to be brave and wise, but it was all pretty difficult. He wanted to be loved, too, if he could fit it in.\u201d","I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before \u2014 and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.","People try so hard to believe in leaders now, pitifully hard. But we no sooner get a popular reformer or politician or soldier or writer or philosopher\u2014a Roosevelt, a Tolstoy, a Wood, a Shaw, a Nietzsche, than the cross-currents of criticism wash him away. My Lord, no man can stand prominence these days. It\'s the surest path to obscurity. People get sick of hearing the same name over and over.","But I didn\'t call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone - he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and as far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling.","her real depths are Irish and romantic and illogical","It was a marriage of love. He was sufficiently spoiled to be charming; she was ingenuous enough to be irresistible.

All that is by way of example. As a matter of fact I am a professed literary thief, hot after the best methods of every writer in my generation.","I want to live where things happen on a big scale.","Another dawn flung itself across the river; a belated taxi hurried along the street, its lamps still shining like burning eyes in a face white from a nights\' carouse.","I refuse to dedicate my life to posterity. Surely one owes as much to the current generation as to one\'s unwanted children. What a fate - to grow rotund and unseemly, to lose my self-love, to think in terms of milk, oatmeal, nurse, diapers. ...Dear dream children, how much more beautiful you are, dazzling little creatures who flutter (all dream children must flutter) on golden, golden wings.","Sometimes when you\'re around I\'ve been tempted to kiss you suddenly and tell you that you were just an idealistic boy with a lot of caste nonsense in his head.","She knew what he wanted, and gave it to him; not words, but a smile of warmth and delight \u2014 a smile that said, \u201cI\u2019m yours for the asking; I\u2019m won. It was not a smile that undervalued herself, because through its beauty it spoke for both of them, expressed all the potential joy that existed between them.\u201d","He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.","The strongest should come first in comedy because once a character is really established as funny everything he does is funny.","\u0422\u044a\u0439 \u0441\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043c \u0441 \u0432\u044a\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0443 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e, \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043d\u0430\u0441\u044f\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 \u0432 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e.","This is what I think now; that the natural state of the sentient adult is a qualified unhappiness. I think also that in an adult the desire to be finer in grain than you are, \\"a constant striving\\" (as those people say who gain their bread by saying it) only adds to this unhappiness in the end--that end that comes to our youth and hope.","There were silences as murmurous as sound. There were pauses that seemed about to shatter and were only to be snatched back to oblivion by the tightening of his arms about her and the sense that she was resting there as a caught, gossamer feather, drifted in out of the dark.","I wasn\'t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something- most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don\'t in the beginning","Then she was in the air, and Carlyle involuntarily held his breath. He had not realized that the dive was nearly forty feet. It seemed an eternity before he heard the swift compact sound as she reached the sea. And it was with his glad sigh of relief when her light watery laughter curled up the side of the cliff and into his anxious ears that he knew he loved her.","The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his platonic conception of himself.","I thought you weren\'t afraid.\\" \\"I never am --but I won\'t throw my life away just to show one man I\'m not.","Trying what?\\" cried Maury fiercely. \\"Trying to pierce the darkness of political idealism with some wild, despairing urge toward truth? Sitting day after day supine in a rigid chair and infinitely removed from life staring at the tip of a steeple through the trees, trying to separate, definitely and for all time, the knowable from the unknowable? Trying to take a piece of actuality and give it glamour from your own soul to make for that inexpressible quality it possessed in life and lost in transit to paper or canvas?","Writers aren\'t exactly people, they\'re a bunch of people trying to be one person.","I suppose all great happiness is a little sad.","A returned battalion of the National Guard paraded through the streets with open ranks for their dead and then stepped down out of romance forever and sold you things over the counters of local stores.","They were careless people, Tom and Daisy\u2014they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. . . .","Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.","I suppose there has been nothing like the airports since the age of the stage-stops - nothing quite as lonely, as sombre-silent. The red-brick depots were built right into the towns they marked - people didn\'t get off at those isolated stations unless they lived there. But airports lead you way back in history like oases, like the stops on the great trade routes. The sight of air travellers strolling in ones and twos into midnight airports will draw a small crowd any night up or two. The young people look at the planes, the older ones look at the passengers with a watchful incredulity.","to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....And one fine morning-","The decision as to when to quit, as to when one is merely floundering around and causing other people trouble, has to be made frequently in a lifetime. In youth we are taught the rather simple rule never to quit, because we are presumably following programmes made by people wiser than ourselves. My own conclusion is that when one has embarked on a course that grows increasingly doubtful and one feels the vital forces beginning to be used up, it is best to ask advice if decent advice is in range...","There are four types of husbands.The husband who always wants to stay in in the evening, has no vices and works for a salary. Totally undesirable!The atavistic master whose mistress one is, to wait on his pleasure. This sort always considers every pretty woman \u201cshallow, a sort of peacock with arrested development.Next comes the worshiper, the idolaters of his wife and all that is his, to the utter oblivion of everything else. This sort demands an emotional actress for a wife. God! It must be an exertion to be thought righteous!And Anthony\u2014a temporarily passionate lover with wisdom enough to realize when it has flown and that it must fly. And I want to get married to Anthony.\u201d","Almost painfully he took his eyes from her.","He says unloved women have no biographies\u2014they have histories.\\" Anthony laughed again. \\"Surely","He was thinking that the young years behind him, hollow and colourful, had been lived in facile and vacillating cynicism upon the recorded emotions of men long dust.","I\'ve always looked on criticism as a sort of envious tribute.","Courage is a sort of insistence on the value of life and the worth of transient things.","A classic is a successful book that has survived the reaction of the next period or generation. Then it\'s safe, like a style in architecture or furniture. It\'s acquired a picturesque dignity to take the place of its fashion....","The feel of her head against his shoulder, of her familiar body, sent a shock of emotion over him. His arms holding her had a tendency to tighten around her.","The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing.","It\u2019s essentially cleaner to be corrupt and rich than it is to be innocent and poor.","You like to help everybody, don\'t you?I only pretend to.","The family were wild,\\" she said suddenly. \\"They tried to marry me off. And then when I\'d begun to feel that after all life was scarcely worth living I found something\\"\u2014her eyes went skyward exultantly\u2014\\"I found something!\\" Carlyle waited and her words came with a rush.\u201cCourage\u2014just that; courage as a rule of life, and something to cling to always. I began to build up this enormous faith in myself. I began to see that in all my idols in the past some manifestation of courage had unconsciously been the thing that attracted me.

All sorts of courage\u2014the beaten, bloody prize-fighter coming up for more\u2014I used to make men take me to prize-fights; the d\xe9class\xe9 woman sailing through a nest of cats and looking at them as if they were mud under her feet; the liking what you like always; the utter disregard for other people\'s opinions\u2014just to live as I liked always and to die in my own way\u2014Did you bring up the cigarettes?\\" He handed one over and held a match for her silently. \\"Still,\\" Ardita continued, \\"the men kept gathering\u2014old men and young men, my mental and physical inferiors, most of them, but all intensely desiring to have me\u2014to own this rather magnificent proud tradition I\'d built up round me. Do you see?\\" \\"Sort of. You never were beaten and you never apologized.\\" \\"Never!\\" She sprang to the edge, poised or a moment like a crucified figure against the sky; then describing a dark parabola plunked without a slash between two silver ripples twenty feet below. Her voice floated up to him again. \\"And courage to me meant ploughing through that dull gray mist that comes down on life\u2014not only over-riding people and circumstances but over-riding the bleakness of living. A sort of insistence on the value of life and the worth of transient things.\\" She was climbing up now, and at her last words her head, with the damp yellow hair slicked symmetrically back, appeared on his level. \\"All very well,\\" objected Carlyle. \\"You can call it courage, but your courage is really built, after all, on a pride of birth. You were bred to that defiant attitude. On my gray days even courage is one of the things that\'s gray and lifeless.\\" She was sitting near the edge, hugging her knees and gazing abstractedly at the white moon; he was farther back, crammed like a grotesque god into a niche in the rock. \\"I don\'t want to sound like Pollyanna,\\" she began, \\"but you haven\'t grasped me yet.

And I feel that till it does I\'ve got to keep my lips shut and my chin high, and my eyes wide\u2014not necessarily any silly smiling. Oh, I\'ve been through hell without a whine quite often\u2014and the female hell is deadlier than the male.\\" \\"But supposing,\\" suggested Carlyle, \\"that before joy and hope and all that came back the curtain was drawn on you for good?\\" Ardita rose, and going to the wall climbed with some difficulty to the next ledge, another ten or fifteen feet above. \\"Why,\\" she called back, \\"then I\'d have won!","Oh, such a shame, such a shame. Oh, such a shame.

The complexity is too subtle, too varied; the values are changing utterly with each lesion of vitality; it has begun to appear that we can learn nothing from the past with which to face the future\u2014so we cease to be impulsive, convincible men, interested in what is ethically true by fine margins, we substitute rules of conduct for ideas of integrity, we value safety above romance, we become, quite unconsciously, pragmatic.","I\'m romantic - a sentimental person thinks things will last - a romantic person hopes against hope that they won\'t.","You intoxicated me. It was just as though you were making me love you by some invisible force.","There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson\u2019s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.","Intelligence is little more than a short foot-rule by which we measure the infinite achievements of Circumstances.","Well, it\'s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it.","Her face, the face of a saint, a viking Madonna, shone through the faint motes that snowed across the candlelight, drew down its flush from the wine-colored lanterns in the pine. She was still as still.","I do,\\" she protested; \\"I want to stand on the street corner like a sandwich man, informing all the passers-by.","I\'m p-paralyzed with happiness.\\" - She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.","He had long been outside of the world of simple desires and their fulfillments, and he was inept and uncertain.","There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.","Anything can happen now that we\'ve slid over this bridge, anything at all...","We drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.","After dark on Saturday night one could stand on the first tee of the golf-course and see the country-club windows as a yellow expanse over a very black and wavy ocean. The waves of this ocean, so to speak, were the heads of many curious caddies, a few of the more ingenious chauffeurs, the golf professional\'s deaf sister--and there were usually several stray, diffident waves who might have rolled inside had they so desired. This was the gallery.The balcony was inside. It consisted of the circle of wicker chairs that lined the wall of the combination clubroom and ballroom. At these Saturday-night dances it was largely feminine; a great babel of middle-aged ladies with sharp eyes and icy hearts behind lorgnettes and large bosoms. The main function of the balcony was critical. It occasionally showed grudging admiration, but never approval, for it is well known among ladies over thirty-five that when the younger set dance in the summer-time it is with the very worst intentions in the world, and if they are not bombarded with stony eyes stray couples will dance weird barbaric interludes in the corners, and the more popular, more dangerous, girls will sometimes be kissed in the parked limousines of unsuspecting dowagers.But, after all, this critical circle is not close enough to the stage to see the actors\' faces and catch the subtler byplay. It can only frown and lean, ask questions and make satisfactory deductions from its set of postulates, such as the one which states that every young man with a large income leads the life of a hunted partridge. It never really appreciates the drama of the shifting, semicruel world of adolescence. No; boxes, orchestra-circle, principals, and chorus are represented by the medley of faces and voices that sway to the plaintive African rhythm of Dyer\'s dance orchestra.","It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.","Again at eight o\u2019clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theater district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.","Theoretically, great opportunities lay ahead of a young man of energy in that day and place, but Carl Miller had been incapable of establishing either with his superiors or his subordinates the reputation for approximate immutability which is essential to success in a hierarchic industry.","They proceeded with an infinite guile that would have horrified her parents.","this is the beauty I want. Beauty has got to be astonishing, astounding\u2014it\u2019s got to burst in on you like a dream, like the exquisite eyes of a girl.","As he held her and tasted her, and as she curved in further and further toward him, with her own lips, new to herself, drowned and engulfed in love, yet solaced and triumphant, he was thankful to have an existence at all, if only as a reflection in her wet eyes.","It was wearisome to contemplate that animate protoplasm, reasonable by courtesy only, shut up in a car by an incomprehensible civilization, taken somewhere, to do a vague something without aim or significance or consequence.","\u0644\u0642\u062f \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0632\u0648\u062c\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647.","That\'s my Middle West - not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps, and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that...","My own rule is to let everything alone.","There\'s only one lesson to be learned from life anyway.... That there\'s no lesson to be learned from life.","Her beauty was cool as this damp breeze, as the moist softness of her own lips.","I\'ve found that I can always do the things that people do in books. Really they are the only things I can do.","She had achieved the elusiveness that gives hidden significance to the least significant remarks.","Trouble has no necessary connection with discouragement --discouragement has a germ of its own, as different from trouble as arthritis is different from a stiff joint.","They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another","Please do not have a band, as I do not care for music.","There\'s no beauty without poignancy and there\'s no poignancy without the feeling that it\'s going, men, names, books, houses\u2014bound for dust\u2014mortal\u2014","(They kiss\u2014definitely and thoroughly.)","The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in strange new ways...","Gloria has a very young soul-irresponsible, as much as anything else.

I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit.","The notion originated with Daisy\u2019s suggestion that we hire five bath-rooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as \u201ca place to have a mint julep.

In a hundred hours she had come to possess all the world\'s dark magic; the blinding belladonna, the caffein converting physical into nervous energy, the mandragora that imposes harmony.","What was the promise with the head sick?","he found, as the new century gathered headway, that his thirst for gayety grew stronger.","all the city was playing with this sound out there in the blue summer dark, throwing it up and calling it back, promising that, in a little while, life would be beautiful as a story, promising happiness, and by that promise giving it","I went in - after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove - but I don\'t believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy\'s face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.","But it was too late. He had angered Providence by resisting too many temptations. There was nothing left but heaven, where he would meet only those who, like him, had wasted earth.","the room had grown smothery.

Something was stirred in him, something not accounted for by the warm smell of the afternoon or the triumphant vividness of red. He felt persistently that the girl was beautiful \u2014 then of a sudden he understood: it was her distance, not a rare and precious distance of soul but still distance, if only in terrestrial yards. The autumn air was between them, and the roofs and the blurred voices. Yet for a not altogether explained second, posing perversely in time, his emotion had been nearer to adoration than in the deepest kiss he had ever known.","This Side of Paradise","Wilson\u2019s glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small gray clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.","an almost chemical change seemed to dissolve and recomposethe very elements of his body.

I sent you some.\\"\\"But it was just talk, back and forth,\\" said Stahr mildly. \\"Interesting talk but nothing more.\\" Now it was all the two ghostly attendants could do to hold Boxley in the deep chair. He struggled to get up; he uttered a single quiet bark which had some relation to laughter but non to amusement, and said:\\"I don\'t think you people read things.

Wilson and his cabinet\u2014a cabinet that in its lack of distinction was strangely reminiscent of the twelve apostles\u2014let loose the carefully starved dogs of war, and the press began to whoop hysterically against the sinister morals, sinister philosophy, and sinister music produced by the Teutonic temperament. Those who fancied themselves particularly broad-minded made the exquisite distinction that it was only the German Government which aroused them to hysteria; the rest were worked up to a condition of retching indecency. Any song which contained the word \\"mother\\" and the word \\"kaiser\\" was assured of a tremendous success. At last every one had something to talk about\u2014and almost every one fully enjoyed it, as though they had been cast for parts in a sombre and romantic play.","This general eclipse of ambition and determination and fortitude, all of the very qualities on which I have prided myself, is ridiculous, and, I must admit, somewhat obscene.","I\'ve told you many times that the first thing I decide is the kind of story I want.

Sloane was snoring heavily, his clothes in a pile by his bed. They dressed and ate breakfast in silence, and then sauntered out to get some air. Amory\'s mind was working slowly, trying to assimilate what had happened and separate from the chaotic imagery that stacked his memory the bare shreds of truth. If the morning had been cold and gray he could have grasped the reins of the past in an instant, but it was one of those days that New York gets sometimes in May, when the air of Fifth Avenue is a soft, light wine. How much or how little Sloane remembered Amory did not care to know; he apparently had none of the nervous tension that was gripping Amory and forcing his mind back and forth like a shrieking saw.","\u042f \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e.\u041b\u044e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c - \u0414\u0436\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d \u0411\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0435\u0440\\"\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u044d\u0442\u0441\u0431\u0438","It is in the twenties that the actual momentum of life begins to slacken, and it is a simple soul indeed to who as many things are significant and meaningful at thirty as at ten years before. At thirty an organ-grinder is a more or less moth-eaten man who grinds an organ - and once he was an organ-grinder! The unmistakable stigma of humanity touches all those impersonal and beautiful things that only youth every grasps in their impersonal glory. A brilliant ball, gay with light romance laughter, wears through its own silks and satins to show the bare framework of a man-made thing - oh, that eternal hand! - a play, most tragic and most divine, becomes merely a succession of speeches, sweated over by the eternal plagiarist in the clammy hours and acted by men subject to cramps, cowardice, and manly sentiment.","Either you think - or else others have to think for you and take power from you, pervert and discipline your natural tastes, civilize and sterilize you.","Too bad she was dull--dull girls were unbearable--certainly pretty though.","But Beatrice Blaine! There was a woman! Early pictures taken on her father\'s estate at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, or in Rome at the Sacred Heart Convent\u2014an educational extravagance that in her youth was only for the daughters of the exceptionally wealthy\u2014showed the exquisite delicacy of her features, the consummate art and simplicity of her clothes. A brilliant education she had\u2014her youth passed in renaissance glory, she was versed in the latest gossip of the Older Roman Families; known by name as a fabulously wealthy American girl to Cardinal Vitori and Queen Margherita and more subtle celebrities that one must have had some culture even to have heard of. She learned in England to prefer whiskey and soda to wine, and her small talk was broadened in two senses during a winter in Vienna. All in all Beatrice O\'Hara absorbed the sort of education that will be quite impossible ever again; a tutelage measured by the number of things and people one could be contemptuous of and charming about; a culture rich in all arts and traditions, barren of all ideas, in the last of those days when the great gardener clipped the inferior roses to produce one perfect bud.","And I like large parties. They\'re so intimate. At small parties there isn\'t any privacy.","His desire re-created her until she lost all vestiges of the old Jenny, even the girl who had met him at the train that morning. Silently, as the night hours went by, he molded her over into an image of love - an image that would endure as long as love itself, or even longer - not to perish till he could say, \'I never really loved her.","Such a kiss--it was a flower held against the face, never to be described, scarcely to be remembered; as though her beauty were giving off emanations of itself which settled transiently and already dissolving upon his heart.","Then the storm came swiftly, first falling from the heavens, then doubly falling in torrents from the mountains and washing loud down the roads and stone ditches; with it came a dark, frightening sky and savage filaments of lightning and world-splitting thunder, while ragged, destroying clouds fled along past the hotel. Mountains and lake disappeared - the hotel crouched amid tumult, chaos and darkness.","I learned a little of beauty - enough to know that it had nothing to do with truth - and I found, moreover, that there was no great literary tradition; there was only the tradition of the eventful death of every literary tradition....","her disposition is not all it should be; she wants what she wants when she wants it and she is prone to make every one around her pretty miserable when she doesn\'t get it\u2014but in the true sense she is not spoiled. Her fresh enthusiasm, her will to grow and learn, her endless faith in the inexhaustibility of romance, her courage and fundamental honesty\u2014these things are not spoiled.","She was a brave, hopeful woman and she was following her husband somewhere, changing herself to this kind of person or that, without being able to lead him a step out of his path, and sometimes realizing with discouragement how deep in him the guarded secret of her direction lay. And yet an air of luck clung about her, as if she were a token...","It was consoling, though, when Nicole remarked, apropos of a distraught saleswoman: \\"Most people think everybody feels about them much more violently than they actually do - they think other people\'s opinions of them swing through great arcs of approval or disapproval.","Siempre que sientas deseos de criticar a alguien, me dijo, recuerda que no a todo el mundo se le han dado tantas facilidades como a ti.","They looked at each other at last, murmuring names that were a spell. Softly the two names lingered on the air, died away more slowly than other words, other names, slower than music in the mind.","Amory usually liked men individually, yet feared them in crowds unless the crowd was around him.","Her life was the significant pause between two glances in a mirror.\\" ( paraphrased from The Beautiful and Damned\\")","It was not so much fun. His work became confused with Nicole\u2019s problems; in addition, her income had increased so fast of late that it seemed to belittle his work. Also, for the purpose of her cure, he had for many years pretended to a rigid domesticity from which he was drifting away, and the pretence became more arduous in this effortless immobility, in which he was inevitably subjected to microscopic examination. When Dick could no longer play what he wanted to play on the piano, it was an indication that life was bring refined down to a point. He stayed in the big room a long time, listening to the buzz of the electric clock, listening to time.","Her eyes in the half-light suggested night and violets, and for a moment he stirred again to that half-forgotten remoteness of the afternoon.","For this is wisdom\u2014to love and live, \xa0\xa0\xa0 To take what fate or the gods may give, \xa0\xa0\xa0 To ask no question, to make no prayer, \xa0\xa0\xa0 To kiss the lips and caress the hair, \xa0\xa0\xa0 Speed passion\'s ebb as we greet its flow, \xa0\xa0\xa0 To have and to hold, and, in time\u2014let go.","But the rest offended her - and inarguably, because it wasn\'t a gesture but an emotion.","It\'s only when the settlement work has gone on for months that one realizes how bad things are. As our secretary said to me, your finger-nails never seem dirty until you wash your hands.","You\'d think you\'d been singled out of all the women in the world for this crowning indignity.\\" \\"What if I do!\\" she cried angrily. \\"It isn\'t an indignity for them. It\'s their one excuse for living. It\'s the one thing they\'re good for. It is an indignity for me.","My courage is faith\u2014faith in the eternal resilience of me\u2014that joy\u2019ll come back, and hope and spontaneity. And I feel that till it does I\u2019ve got to keep my lips shut and my chin high, and my eyes wide\u2014not necessarily any silly smiling.

No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.","We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as the wind does on the sea.","there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race,","already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.","It became established among his Harvard intimates that he was in Rome, and those of them who were abroad that year looked him up and discovered with him, on many moonlight excursions, much in the city that was older than the Renaissance or indeed than the republic. Maury Noble, from Philadelphia, for instance, remained two months, and together they realized the peculiar charm of Latin women and had a delightful sense of being very young and free in a civilization that was very old and free. Not","\u2014 for he was young now as he would never be again, and more triumphant than death.","No hay fuego ni fr\xedo que pueda desafiar a lo que un hombre guarda entre los fantasmas de su coraz\xf3n.","We\'ll all be failures?\\"\\"Yes. I don\'t mean only money failures, but just sort of - of ineffectual and sad, and - oh, how can I tell you?","Not a bit of will\u2014I\'m a slave to my emotions, to my likes, to my hatred of boredom, to most of my desires\u2014","And of course all that he is is a gifted man without a moral sense.","I like you first and second and third,","I think it\u2019s wonderful that we can kiss and forget, and when we can\u2019t it\u2019ll be time to argue.","You\'re a rotten driver,\\" I protested. \\"Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn\'t drive at all.\\"\\"I am careful.\\"\\"No you\'re not.\\"\\"Well, other people are,\\" she said lightly.\\"What\'s that got to do with it?\\"\\"They\'ll keep out of my way,\\" she insisted. \\"It takes two to make an accident.","Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her.","This selfishness is not only part of me. It is the most living part.It is somehow transcending rather than by avoiding that selfishness that I can bring poise and balance into my life.","The college dreamed on-- awake. He felt a nervous excitement that might have been the very throb of its slow heart. It was a stream where he was to throw a stone whose faint ripple would be vanishing almost as it left his hand. As yet he had nothing, he had taken nothing.","No... no... We never forgive those we can understand... We can only forgive those who wound us for no reason at all...","Sweetness is hard.Real sweetness is a sort of hardness\u2014and strength.~Lois","Two out of every three professional officers considered that wars were made for armies and not armies for wars.","On Shaw\u2019s principle that \u201cif you don\u2019t get what you like, you better like what you get,","Acho que todo mundo na Am\xe9rica, exceto umas mil pessoas escolhidas, deveria ser obrigado a aceitar um c\xf3digo moral super-r\xedgido: o catolicismo romano, por exemplo.

Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o\u2019clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gayeties, to bid them a hasty good-by. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-that\u2019s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: \u201cAre you going to the Ordways\u2019? the Herseys\u2019? the Schultzes\u2019? and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.That\u2019s my Middle West \u2014 not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family\u2019s name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all \u2014 Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\u201d","Old Marcus still managed to function with disquieting resilience. Some never-atrophying instinct warned hi of danger, of gangings up against him--he was never so dangerous himself as when others considered him surrounded. His grey face had attained such immobility that even those who were accustomed to watch the reflex of the inner corner of his eye could no longer see it. Nature had grown a little white whisker there to conceal it; his armor was complete.","It was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the being. This, too, was quite characteristic of Amory.","The grass is full of ghost to-night.\' \'The whole campus is alive with them.","A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby\u2019s splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we crossed Blackwell\u2019s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.","I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter. \'I suppose she talks, she eats, and everything.","The sea, he thought, had treasured it\'s memories deeper than the faithless land.","What grubworms women are to crawl on their bellies through colorless marriages! Marriage was created not to be a background but to need one. Mine is going to be outstanding. It can\'t, shan\'t be the setting--it\'s going to be the performance, the live, lovely, glamourous performance, and the world shall be the scenery. I refuse to dedicate my life to posterity. Surely one owes as much to the current generation as to one\'s unwanted children. What a fate--to grow rotund and unseemly, to lose my self-love, to think in terms of milk, oatmeal, nurse, diapers\u2026. Dear dream children, how much more beautiful you are, dazzling little creatures who flutter (all dream children must flutter) on golden, golden wings-- --","For years afterward when Amory thought of Eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart. The night when they rode up the cold slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds, he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore; and when he lost it he lost also the power of regretting it. Eleanor was, say, the last time that evil crept close to Amory under the mask of beauty, the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes.","mad with common sense","It\'s not that I have any moral compunctions about work . . . but grampa may die to-morrow and he may live for ten years.

He tried honestly to divorce her from any obsession that he had stitched her together - glad to see her build up happiness and confidence apart from him; the difficulty was that, eventually, Nicole brought everything to his feet, gifts of sacrificial ambrosia, of worshipping myrtle.","Cloaked by the erotic darkness she exhausted the future quickly, with all the eventualities that might lead up to a kiss, but with the kiss itself as blurred as a kiss in pictures.","For years afterward when Amory thought of Eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart.","He went three hundred yards up the slope to the other hotel, he engaged a room, and found himself washing without a memory of the intervening ten minutes, only a sort of drunken flush pierced with voices, unimportant voices that did not know how much he was loved.","All through the crowd were men in uniform, sailors from the great fleet anchored in the Hudson, soldiers with divisional insignia from Massachusetts to California, wanting fearfully to be noticed, and finding the great city thoroughly fed up with soldiers unless they were nicely massed into pretty formations and uncomfortable under the weight of a pack and rifle. Through this medley Dean and Gordon wandered; the former interested, made alert by the display of humanity at its frothiest and gaudiest; the latter reminded of how often he had been one of the crown, tired, casually fed, overworked, and dissipated. To Dean the struggle was significant, young, cheerful; to Gordon it was dismal, meaningless, endless.","In the square, as they came out, a suspended mass of gasoline exhaust cooked slowly in the July sun. It was a terrible thing - unlike pure heat it held no promise of rural escape by suggested only roads choked with the same four asthma.","I don\'t understand yet how it all happened.\'\'Neither do I.\' He smiled grimly. \'I guess these baby parties are pretty rough affairs.","The world only exists in your eyes-- your conception of it.

The vividly pictured hand on Rosemary\'s cheek, the quicker breath, the white excitement of the event viewed from outside, the inviolable secret warmth within.","Ne gariptir, ac\u0131dan ka\xe7\u0131nmaya \xe7al\u0131\u015f\u0131rken, bazen bizi o noktaya getiren ayak izlerinin bir bir \xfczerinden ge\xe7mek gerekebilir.","He sometimes looked back with awe at the carnivals of affection he had given, as a general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood lust.","the snow of twenty-nine wasn\'t real snow.

Rosemary saw her suddenly in a new way and found her one of the most beautiful people she had ever known.

She was still as still","If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.","Gatsby looked at Daisy in a way that every young girl wanted to be looked at","He desired her and, so far as her virginal emotions went, she contemplated a surrender with equanimity. Yet she knew she would forget him half an hour after she left him - like an actor kissed in a picture.","I suppose he\u2019d had the name ready for a long time, even then.","Those eyes, with the grayness and eternity of a cliff of soft granite, caught his.","Wilson shook his head.

The month assumed an ominous and inescapable significance\u2014making her wonder, through these nebulous half-fevered hours whether after all she had not wasted her faintly tired beauty, whether there was such a thing as use for any quality bounded by a harsh and inevitable mortality.

It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.","You\'ve got to sell your heart, your strongest reactions, not the little minor things that only touch you lightly, the little experiences that you might tell at dinner.","He had fixed his aunt with the bright-yellow eye, giving her that acute and exaggerated attention that young males are accustomed to render to all females who are of no further value.","As you first see him he wonders frequently whether he is not without honor and slightly mad,","Maybe we\'ll have more fun this summer but this particular fun is over.

But if there is another bad driver, then there can be a crash.","She illustrated very simple principles, containing in herself her own doom, but illustrated them so accurately that there was grace in the procedure, and presently Rosemary would try to imitate it.","Saying good-by, Dick was aware of Elsie Speers\' full charm, aware that she meant rather more to him than merely a last unwilingly relinquished fragment of Rosemary. He could possibly have made up Rosemary - he could never have made up her mother.","For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes.","Then Rosalind began popping into his mind again, and he found his lips forming her name over and over.","At eleven she sat with Dick and the Norths at a houseboat caf\xe9 just opened on the Seine. The river shimmered with lights from the bridges and cradled many cold moons.","One writes of scars healed, a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin, but there is no such thing in the life of the individual.

A \\"schizophr\xeane\\" is well named as a split personality - Nicole was alternately a person to whom nothing need be explained and one to whom nothing could be explained. It was necessary to treat her with active and affirmative insistence, keeping the road to reality always open, making the road to escape harder going. But the brilliance, the versatility of madness is akin to the resourcefulness of water seeping through, over and around a dike. It requires the united front of many people to work against it.","New friends, he said, as if it were an important point, \u201ccan often have a better time together than old friends.\u201d With\u201d","There was the sun, letting down great glowing masses of heat; there was life, active and snarling, moving about them like a fly swarm\u2014the dark pants of smoke from the engine, a crisp \\"all aboard!\\" and a bell ringing.

Wilson has only been powerful when he has represented; he\'s had to compromise over and over again. Just as soon as Trotsky and Lenin take a definite, consistent stand they\'ll become merely two-minute figures like Kerensky. Even Foch hasn\'t half the significance of Stonewall Jackson. War used to be the most individualistic pursuit of man, and yet the popular heroes of the war had neither authority nor responsibility: Guynemer and Sergeant York. How could a schoolboy make a hero of Pershing? A big man has no time really to do anything but just sit and be big.","A young man can work at excessive speed with no ill effects, but youth is unfortunately not a permanent condition of life.","Pero a mi lado se encontraba Jordan, que, a diferencia de Daisy, era demasiado lista para llevar sue\xf1os, ya olvidados, de una era a otra.","Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby\u2019s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.","He smiled understandingly\u2014much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced\u2014or seemed to face\u2014the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.","Me mir\xf3 con comprensi\xf3n, mucho m\xe1s que con comprensi\xf3n.

In the excitement of seeing herself in it, it seemed as if she had shed the old skin of winter and emerged a shining chrysalis with no stain; and going downstairs her feet fell softly just off the beat of the music from below.

But they were frightened at his surviving will, once a will to love, now become a will to die.","We all have souls of different ages,","They stopped thinking with an almost painful relief, stopped seeing; they only breathed and sought each other.

Love lingered \u2013 by way of long conversations at night into those stark hours when the mind thins and sharpens and the borrowings from dreams become the stuff of all life, by way of deep and intimate kindnesses they developed toward each other, by way of their laughing at the same absurdities and thinking the same things noble and the same things sad.","To this husband of hers she made the last concession of married life, which is more complete, more irrevocable, than the first\u2014she listened to him. She told herself that the years had brought her tolerance\u2014actually they had slain what measure she had ever possessed of moral courage.

It was just the sort of thing that was likely to happen to him when he was in the mood of not wanting to see any one. So rigidly did he sometimes guard his exposed self-consciousness that frequently he defeated his own purposes; as an actor who underplays a part sets up a craning forward, a stimulated emotional attention in an audience, and seems to create in others an ability to bridge the gap he has left open. Similarly we are seldom sorry for those who need and crave our pity \u2014 we reserve this for those who, by other means, make us exercise the abstract function of pity.","Give me a hero and I\'ll give you a tragedy.","Dick was about to retort by commenting on the extraordinary suits worn by Tommy and Prince Chillicheff, suits of a cut and pattern fantastic enough to have sauntered down Beale Street on a Sunday\u2014when","Standing in the station, with Paris in back of them, it seemed as if they were vicariously leaning a little over the ocean, already undergoing a sea-change, a shifting about of atoms to form the essential molecule of new people.","A classic,\\" suggested Anthony, \\"is a successful book that has survived the reaction of the next period or generation.

In the dead white hours in Zurich staring into a stranger\'s pantry across the upshine of a streetlamp, he used to think that he wanted to be brave and wise, but it was all pretty difficult. He wanted to be loved, too, if he could fit that in.","For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face","that there was no great literary tradition; there was only the tradition of the eventful death of every literary tradition\u2026. \\"Then","The growth of intimacy is like that.

She smiled, a moving childish smile that was like all the lost youth in the world.","Then it was something more. I wasn\u2019t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.

The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bead at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy\'s wing.","A classic, suggested Anthony, \u201cis a successful book that has survived the reaction of the next period or generation.\u201d","As he helf her and tasted her, and she curved in further and further toward him, with her own lips, new to herself, drowned and engulfed in love, yet solaced and triumphant, he was thankful to have an existence at all, if only as a reflection in her wet eyes.","As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion.

S naporom se uspravio u polo\u017eaj u kojem je, iako je sjedio, djelovao kao da stoji.- Ono poslijepodne kad ste me vodili na onaj smije\u0161ni ples, zna\u0161 koji mislim, kod St. Genevieve... - po\u010deo je.- Sje\u0107am se.
