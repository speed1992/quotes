But nothing can be changed until it is faced.","I can\'t believe what you say, because I see what you do.","I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.","You have to decide who you are and force the world to deal with you, not with its idea of you.","Ask any Mexican, any Puerto Rican, any black man, any poor person - ask the wretched how they fare in the halls of justice, and then you will know, not whether or not the country is just, but whether or not it has any love for justice, or any concept of it. It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.","One cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one\'s own.","Remember, to hate, to be violent, is demeaning. It means you\'re afraid of the other side of the coin -- to love and be loved.","If one really wishes to know how justice is administered in a country, one does not question the policemen, the lawyers, the judges, or the protected members of the middle class. One goes to the unprotected - those, precisely, who need the law\'s protection most! - and listens to their testimony.","You cannot fix what you will not face.","Words like \\"freedom,\\" \\"justice,\\" \\"democracy\\" are not common concepts; on the contrary, they are rare. People are not born knowing what these are. It takes enormous and, above all, individual effort to arrive at the respect for other people that these words imply.","To be black and conscious in America is to be in a constant state of rage.","... every human being is an unprecedented miracle.","People who treat other people as less than human must not be surprised when the bread they have cast on the waters comes floating back to them, poisoned.","The purpose of education...is to create in a person the ability to look at the world for himself, to make his own decisions.","For nothing is fixed, forever and forever, it is not fixed; the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock. Generations do not cease to be born, and we are responsible to them because we are the only witnesses they have. The sea rises, the light fails, lovers cling to each other and children cling to us. The moment we cease to hold each other, the moment we break faith with one another, the sea engulfs us and the light goes out.","The place in which I\'ll fit will not exist until I make it.","People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction.","The hope of the world lies in what one demands, not of others, but of oneself.","Freedom is not something that anybody can be given. Freedom is something people take, and people are as free as they want to be","I love America more than any other country in the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.","We are responsible for the world in which we find ourselves, if only because we are the only sentient force which can change it.","Trust life, and it will teach you, in joy and sorrow, all you need to know.","I\'m not interested in anybody\'s guilt. Guilt is a luxury that we can no longer afford. I know you didn\'t do it, and I didn\'t do it either, but I am responsible for it because I am a man and a citizen of this country and you are responsible for it, too, for the very same reason... Anyone who is trying to be conscious must begin to dismiss the vocabulary which we\'ve used so long to cover it up, to lie about the way things are.","It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.","The American idea of racial progress is measured by how fast I become white.","The role of the artist is exactly the same as the role of the lover. If I love you, I have to make you conscious of the things you don\u2019t see.","The world is before you, and you need not take it or leave it as it was when you came in.","A civilization is not destroyed by wicked people; it is not necessary that people be wicked but only that they be spineless.","You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read.","It is astonishing the lengths to which a person, or a people, will go in order to avoid a truthful mirror.","In order to have a conversation with someone you must reveal yourself.","The most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose.","It took many years of vomiting up all the filth I\u2019d been taught about myself, and half-believed, before I was able to walk on the earth as though I had a right to be here.","I think that the inability to love is the central problem, because that inability masks a certain terror, and that terror is the terror of being touched. And if you can\'t be touched, you can\'t be changed. And if you can\'t be changed, you can\'t be alive.","A liberal: someone who thinks he knows more about your experience than you do.","The civilized have created the wretched, quite coldly and deliberately, and do not intend to change the status quo; are responsible for their slaughter and enslavement; rain down bombs on defenseless children whenever and wherever they decide that their \\"vital interests\\" are menaced, and think nothing of torturing a man to death: these people are not to be taken seriously when they speak of the \\"sanctity\\" of human life, or the \\"conscience\\" of the civilized world.","It demands great spiritual resilience not to hate the hater whose foot is on your neck, and an even greater miracle of perception and charity not to teach your child to hate.","Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.","The victim who is able to articulate the situation of the victim has ceased to be a victim: he or she has become a threat.","You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was Dostoevsky and Dickens who taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who ever had been alive. Only if we face these open wounds in ourselves can we understand them in other people.","Artists are here to disturb the peace.","Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.","The paradox of education is precisely this - that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society in which he is being educated.","There are so many ways of being despicable it quite makes one\u2019s head spin. But the way to be really despicable is to be contemptuous of other people\u2019s pain.","It comes as a great shock\u2026to discover that the flag to which you have pledged allegiance\u2026has not pledged allegiance to you. It comes as a great shock to see Gary Cooper killing off the Indians, and although you are rooting for Gary Cooper, that the Indians are you.","This is the charged, the dangerous moment, when everything must be re-examined, must be made new, when nothing at all can be taken for granted.","Color is not a human or a personal reality; it is a political reality.","You\'ve got to tell the world how to treat you. If the world tells you how you are going to be treated, you are in trouble.","What passes for identity in America is a series of myths about one\'s heroic ancestors. It\'s astounding to me, for example, that so many people really seem to believe that the country was founded by a band of heroes who wanted to be free.","If I am not what you say I am, then you are not who you think you are.","Know from whence you came. If you know whence you came, there are absolutely no limitations to where you can go.","The challenge is in the moment; the time is always now.","We should certainly know by now that it is one thing to overthrow a dictator or repel an invader and quite another thing really to achieve a revolution. Time and time and time again, the people discover that they have merely betrayed themselves into the hands of yet another Pharaoh, who, since he was necessary to put the broken country together, will not let them go.","Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up.","Talent is insignificant. I know a lot of talented ruins. Beyond talent lie all the usual words: discipline, love, luck, but, most of all, endurance.","God be thanked for books! They are the voices of the distant and the dead.","People can cry much easier than they can change.","People don\'t have any mercy. They tear you limb from limb, in the name of love. Then, when you\'re dead, when they\'ve killed you by what they made you go through, they say you didn\'t have any character. They weep big, bitter tears - not for you. For themselves, because they\'ve lost their toy.","Whatever you describe to another person is also a revelation of who you are and who you think you are. You can not describe anything without betraying your point of view, your aspirations, your fears, your hopes. Everything.","I am what time, circumstance, history, have made of me, certainly, but I am also, much more than that. So are we all.","You don\'t realize that you\'re intelligent until it gets you into trouble.","Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within. I use the word \\"love\\" here not merely in the personal sense but as a state of being, or a state of grace - not in the infantile American sense of being made happy but in the tough and universal sense of quest and daring and growth.","People who believe that they are strong-willed and the masters of their destiny can only continue to believe this by becoming specialists in self-deception.","The reason people think it\'s important to be white is that they think it\'s important not to be black.","Please try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity","Drive to the heart of every answer and expose the question the answer hides.","It is very nearly impossible... to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind.","To accept one\u2019s past \u2013 one\u2019s history \u2013 is not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it. An invented past can never be used; it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought.","There is never time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment; the time is always now.","Be careful what you set your heart upon - for it will surely be yours.","It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who had ever been alive.","Precisely at the point when you begin to develop a conscience you must find yourself at war with your society.","The white man discovered the Cross by way of the Bible, but the black man discovered the Bible by way of the Cross.","The power of the white world is threatened whenever a black man refuses to accept the white world\'s definitions.","White people will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this - which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never - the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.","It is dangerous to be an American Negro male. America has never wanted its Negroes to be men, and does not, generally, treat them as men. It treats them as mascots, pets, or things.","The trick is to love somebody.... If you love one person, you see everybody else differently.","Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them.","It is rare indeed that people give. Most people guard and keep; they suppose that it is they themselves and what they identify with themselves that they are guarding and keeping, whereas what they are actually guarding and keeping is their system of reality and what they assume themselves to be.","I can\'t be a pessimist, because I am alive.","I conceive of God, in fact, as a means of liberation and not a means to control others.","If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time we got rid of Him.","Nobody is more dangerous than he who imagines himself pure in heart; for his purity, by definition, is unassailable.","A person does not lightly elect to oppose his society. One would much rather be at home among one\'s compatriots than be mocked and detested by them. And there is a level on which the mockery of people, even their hatred, is moving, because it is so blind: It is terrible to watch people cling to their captivity and insist on their own destruction.","When the white man came to Africa, the white man had the Bible and the African had the land, but now it is the white man who is being, reluctantly and bloodily, separated from the land, and the African who is still attempting to digest or to vomit up the Bible.","If the word \'integration\' means anything, this is what it means that we, with love, shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it.","When Americans look out on the world, they see nothing but dark and menacing strangers who appear to have no sense of rhythm at all, nor any respect or affection for white people; and white Americans really do not know what to make of all this, except to increase the defense budget.","Whoever debases others is debasing himself.","Hatred, which could destroy so much, never failed to destroy the man who hated, and this was an immutable law.","There are too many things we do not wish to know about ourselves. People are not, for example, terribly anxious to be equal (equal, after all, to what and to whom?) but they love the idea of being superior.","A society must assume that it is stable, but the artist must know, and he must let us know, that there is nothing stable under heaven.","The past is what makes the present coherent, and the past will remain horrible for exactly as long as we refuse to assess it honestly.","The great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do.","Most of us, no matter what we say, are walking in the dark, whistling in the dark. Nobody knows what is going to happen to him from one moment to the next, or how one will bear it. This is irreducible. And it\'s true of everybody. Now, it is true that the nature of society is to create, among its citizens, an illusion of safety; but it is also absolutely true that the safety is always necessarily an illusion. Artists are here to disturb the peace.","One writes out of one thing only - one\'s own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give. This is the only real concern of the artist, to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art.","It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death-- ought to decide, indeed, to earn one\'s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible to life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return. One must negotiate this passage as nobly as possible, for the sake of those who are coming after us.","And love will simply have no choice but to go into battle with space and time, and furthermore, to win.","Great art can only be created out of love.","Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death - ought to decide, indeed, to earn one\'s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life.","This world is white no longer, and it will never be white again.","The price one pays for pursuing any profession or calling is an intimate knowledge of its ugly side.","One day, to everyone\u2019s astonishment, someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up.","Allegiance, after all, has to work two ways; and one can grow weary of an allegiance which is not reciprocal.","Recognizing a problem doesn\'t always bring a solution, but until we recognize that problem, there can be no solution.","The universe, which is not merely the stars and the moon and the planets, flowers, grass and trees, but other people, has evolved no terms for your existence, has made no room for you, and if love will not swing wide the gates, no other power will or can. And if one despairs-- as who has not?-- of human love, God\'s love alone is left.","You write in order to change the world, knowing perfectly well that you probably can\'t, but also knowing that literature is indispensable to the world... The world changes according to the way people see it, and if you alter, even by a millimeter, the way... people look at reality, then you can change it.","We all commit our crimes. The thing is to not lie about them -- to try to understand what you have done, why you have done it. That way, you can begin to forgive yourself. That\'s very important. If you don\'t forgive yourself you\'ll never be able to forgive anybody else and you\'ll go on committing the same crimes forever.","Everyone wishes to be loved, but in the event, nearly no one can bear it. Everyone desires love but also finds it impossible to believe that he deserves it.","Neither love nor terror makes one blind: indifference makes one blind.","The poet or the revolutionary is there to articulate the necessity, but until the people themselves apprehend it, nothing can happen ... Perhaps it can\'t be done without the poet, but it certainly can\'t be done without the people. The poet and the people get on generally very badly, and yet they need each other. The poet knows it sooner than the people do. The people usually know it after the poet is dead; but that\'s all right. The point is to get your work done, and your work is to change the world.","You have to go the way your blood beats. If you don\'t live the only life you have, you won\'t live some other life, you won\'t live any life at all.","Perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.","A child cannot be taught by anyone who despises him, and a child cannot afford to be fooled.","If you\'re afraid to die, you will not be able to live.","There is a \'sanctity\' involved with bringing a child into this world: it is better than bombing one out of it.","People pay for what they do, and still more for what they have allowed themselves to become, and they pay for it, very simply, by the lives they lead.","Any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known it, the loss of all that gave one an identity, the end of safety.","To be born in a free society and not to be born free is to be born into a lie. To be told by co-citizens and co-Christians that you have no value, no history, have never done anything that is worthy of human respect destroys you because in the beginning you believe it.","I\'ve always believed that you can think positive just as well as you can think negative.","For, while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard. There isn\'t any other tale to tell, it\'s the only light we\'ve got in all this darkness.","Hatred is always self hatred, and there is something suicidal about it.","There is something terribly radical about believing that one\'s own experience and images are important enough to speak about, much less to write about and to perform","No people come into possession of a culture without having paid a heavy price for it.","Any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known it, the loss of all that gave one an identity, the end of safety. And at such a moment, unable to see and not daring to imagine what the future will now bring forth, one clings to what one knew, or dreamed that one possessed. Yet, it is only when a man is able, without bitterness or self-pity, to surrender a dream he has long cherished or a privilege he has long possessed that he is set free - he has set himself free - for higher dreams, for greater privileges.","It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one\'s own: in the face of one\'s victim, one sees oneself.","But the relationship of morality and power is a very subtle one. Because ultimately power without morality is no longer power.","Nothing is more desirable than to be released from an affliction, but nothing is more frightening than to be divested of a crutch.","There are people in the world for whom \\"coming along\\" is a perpetual process, people who are destined never to arrive.","Identity would seem to be the garment with which one covers the nakedness of the self: in which case, it is best that the garment be loose, a little like the robes of the desert, through which one\'s nakedness can always be felt, and, sometimes, discerned. This trust in one\'s nakedness is all that gives one the power to change one\'s robes.","There are too many things we do not wish to know about ourselves.","People can\'t, unhappily, invent their mooring posts, their lovers and their friends, anymore than they can invent their parents. Life gives these and also takes them away and the great difficulty is to say Yes to life.","The interior life is a real life, and the intangible dreams of people have a tangible effect on the world.","Fires can\'t be made with dead embers, nor can enthusiasm be stirred by spiritless men. Enthusiasm in our daily work lightens effort and turns even labor into pleasant tasks.","People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state on innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.","You want to write a sentence as clean as a bone. That is the goal.","You write in order to change the world ... if you alter, even by a millimeter, the way people look at reality, then you can change it.","The moment we break faith with one another, the sea engulfs us and the light goes out.","American history is longer, larger, more various, more beautiful, and more terrible than anything anyone has ever said about it.","Art has to be a kind of confession. I don\'t mean a true confession in the sense of that dreary magazine. The effort it seems to me, is: if you can examine and face your life, you can discover the terms with which you are connected to other lives, and they can discover them, too - the terms with which they are connected to other people.","For nothing is more unbearable, once one has it, than freedom.","The impossible is the least that one can demand.","To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.","All racists are irresponsible.","A writer has to take all the risks of putting down what he sees. No one can tell him about that. No one can control that reality. It reminds me of something Pablo Picasso was supposed to have said to Gertrude Stein while he was painting her portrait. Gertrude said, \u201cI don\u2019t look like that.\u201d And Picasso replied, \u201cYou will.\u201d And he was right.","The only thing that white people have that black people need, or should want, is power-and no one holds power forever.","The occurrence of an event is not the same thing as knowing what it is that one has lived through. Most people had not lived -- nor could it, for that matter, be said that they had died-- through any of their terrible events. They had simply been stunned by the hammer. They passed their lives thereafter in a kind of limbo of denied and unexamined pain. The great question that faced him this morning was whether or not had had ever, really, been present at his life.","Not only was I not born to be a slave; I was not born to hope to become the equal of the slave master.","Education is indoctrination if you\'re white - subjugation if you\'re black.","It is said that the camera cannot lie, but rarely do we allow it to do anything else, since the camera sees what you point it at: the camera sees what you want it to see.","Writing is a political instrument.","The sea rises, the light fails, lovers cling to each other and children cling to us. The moment we cease to hold each other, the moment we break faith with one another, the sea engulfs us and the light goes out.","When a man asks himself what is meant by action he proves that he isn\'t a man of action. Action is a lack of balance. In order to act you must be somewhat insane. A reasonably sensible man is satisfied with thinking.","Love is like the lightning, and your maturity is signaled by the extent to which you can accept the dangers and the power and the beauty of love.","True rebels after all, are as rare as true lovers,and in both cases, to mistake a fever for passion can destroy one\'s life","We can make America what America must become.","If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving. And, after all, one can give freedom only by setting someone free.","Love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters?","For these are all our children, we will all profit by or pay for whatthey become.","I love America more than any other country in the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually. I think all theories are suspect, that the finest principles may have to be modified, or may even be pulverized by the demands of life, and that one must find, therefore, one\'s own moral center and move through the world hoping that this center will guide one aright.","There are, forever, swamps to be drained, cities to be created, mines to be exploited, children to be fed ... But the conquest of the physical world is not man\u2019s only duty. He is also enjoined to conquer the great wilderness of himself. The precise role of the artist, then, is to illuminate that darkness, blaze roads through vast forests, so that we will not, in all our doing, lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.","No man is a devil in his own mind.","Somebody,\\" said Jacques, \\"your father or mine, should have told us that not many people have ever died of love. But multitudes have perished, and are perishing every hour - and in the oddest places! - for the lack of it.","The primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid: the state of being alone.","All art is a kind of confession, more or less oblique. All artists, if they are to survive, are forced, at last, to tell the whole story, to vomit the anguish up.","Yr crown has been bought and paid for. All you have to do is put it on yr head","Man cannot live by profit alone.","It is a great shock at the age of five or six to find that in a world of Gary Coopers you are the Indian.","Our dehumanization of the Negro then is indivisible from our dehumanization of ourselves; the loss of our own identity is the price we pay for our annulment of his.","I must oppose any attempt that Negroes may make to do to others what has been done to them. . . . I know the spiritual wasteland to which that road leads . . . whoever debases others is debasing himself.","A writer has to take all the risks of putting down what he sees.","To act is to be committed, and to be committed is to be in danger.","Sentimentality, the ostentatious parading of excessive and spurious emotion, is the mark of dishonesty, the inability to feel.","People who cling to their illusions find it difficult, if not impossible, to learn anything worth learning: a people under the necessity of creating themselves must examine everything, and soak up learning the way the roots of a tree soak up water.","Experience is a private, very largely speechless affair.","There are few things more dreadful than dealing with a man who knows he is going under, in his own eyes, and in the eyes of others. Nothing can help that man. What is left of that man flees from what is left of human attention.","It will be hard James but you come from sturdy peasant stock men who picked cotton and dammed rivers and built railroads and in the teeth of the most terrifying odds achieved an unassailable and monumental dignity You come from a long line of great poets some of the greatest poets since Homer. One of them said \\"The very time I thought I was lost My dungeon shook and my chains fell off.\\" You know and I know that the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too soon. We cannot be free until they are free. God bless you James and Godspeed.","What passes for identity in America is a series of myths about one\'s heroic ancestors. It\'s astounding to me, for example, that so many people really appear to believe that the country was founded by a band of heroes who wanted to be free. That happens not to be true. What happened was that some people left Europe because they couldn\'t stay there any longer and had to go somewhere else to make it. That\'s all. They were hungry, they were poor, they were convicts. Those who were making it in England, for example, did not get on the Mayflower. That\'s how the country was settled.","The responsibility of a writer is to excavate the experience of the people who produced him.","Money, it turned out, was exactly like sex, you thought of nothing else if you didn\'t have it and thought of other things if you did.","The American ideal is, after all, that everyone should be as much alike as possible.","Societies never know it, but the war of an artist with his society is a lover\'s war, and he does, at his best, what lovers do, which is to reveal the beloved to himself and, with that revelation, to make freedom real.","There are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent, accumulating contempt and hatred of a people.","Confusion is a luxury which only the very, very young can possibly afford and you are not that young anymore","Each of us, helplessly and forever, contains the other - male in female, female in male, white in black, and black in white. We are part of each other. Many of my countrymen appear to find this fact exceedingly inconvenient and even unfair, and so, very often, do I. But none of us can do anything about it.","The artistic image is not intended to represent the thing itself, but, rather, the reality of the force the thing contains.","To be sensual, I think, is to respect and rejoice in the force of life, of life itself, and to be present in all that one does, from the effort of loving to the breaking of bread.","A real writer is always shifting and changing and searching.","When one begins to live by habit and by quotation, one has begun to stop living.","It must be remembered that in those great days I was considered to be an \\"integrationist\\" - this was never, quite, my own idea of myself - and Malcolm was considered to be a \\"racist in reverse.\\" This formulation, in terms of power - and power is the arena in which racism is acted out - means absolutely nothing: it may even be described as a cowardly formulation. The powerless, by definition, can never be \\"racists,\\" for they can never make the world pay for what they feel or fear except by the suicidal endeavor which makes them fanatics or revolutionaries, or both.","People are trapped in history and history is trapped in them.","When human rights are abused on a grand scale, the broth of purity boils and feeds the rebellion of a new order.","Society is held together by our need; we bind it together with legend, myth, coercion, fearing that without it we will be hurled into that void, within which, like the earth before the Word was spoken, the foundations of society are hidden.","Do I really want to be integrated into a burning house?","If you are going to be a writer there is nothing I can say to stop you; if you\'re not going to be a writer nothing I can say will help you. What you really need at the beginning is somebody to let you know that the effort is real.","To defend oneself against a fear is simply to insure that one will, one day, be conquered by it; fears must be faced.","I am aware that no man is a villain in his own eyes.","To be with God is really to be involved in some enormous, overwhelming desire, and joy, and power which you cannot control, which controls you.","You know, it\'s not the world that was my oppressor, because what the world does to you, if the world does it to you long enough and effectively enough, you begin to do to yourself.","We are very cruelly trapped between what we would like to be and what we actually are. And we cannot possibly become what we would like to be until we are willing to ask ourselves just why the lives we lead on this continent are mainly so empty, so tame, and so ugly.","You don\u2019t have a home until you leave it and then, when you have left it, you never can go back.","Unless a writer is extremely old when he dies, in which case he has probably become a neglected institution, his death must always be seen as untimely. This is because a real writer is always shifting and changing and searching. The world has many labels for him, of which the most treacherous is the label of Success.","The real victim of bigotry is the white man who hides his weakness under his myth of superiority.","Pessimists are the people who have no hope for themselves or for others. Pessimists are also people who think the human race is beneath their notice, that they\'re better than other human beings.","All I know about music is that not many people ever really hear it. And even then, on the rare occasions when something opens within, and the music enters, what we mainly hear, or hear corroborated, are personal, private, vanishing evocations. But the man who creates the music is hearing something else, is dealing with the roar rising from the void and imposing order on it as it hits the air. What is evoked in him, then, is of another order, more terrible because it has no words, and triumphant, too, for that same reason. And his triumph, when he triumphs, is ours.","All art is a kind of confession.","Because I was raised in a Christian culture I never considered myself to be a totally free human being.","It is hard for anyone under twenty to realise that death has already assigned them a number, which is going to come up one day.","Everybody\'s journey is individual. If you fall in love with a boy, you fall in love with a boy. The fact that many Americans consider it a disease says more about them than it does about homosexuality.","Freaks are called freaks and are treated as they are treated \u2013 in the main, abominably \u2013 because they are human beings who cause to echo, deep within us, our most profound terrors and desires.","The world\'s definitions are one thing and the life one actually lives is quite another. One cannot allow oneself, nor one\'s family, friends, or lovers - to say nothing of one\'s children - to live according to the world\'s definitions: one must find a way, perpetually, to be stronger and better than that.","When you\'re writing you\'re trying to find out something which you don\'t know.","The purpose of art is to lay bare the questions that have been hidden by the answers.","Everything now, we must assume, is in our hands; we have no right to assume otherwise. If we do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world.","If you think too far ahead, if you even try to think too far ahead, you\'ll never make it.","The writer\'s only real task: to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art","People are continually pointing out to me the wretchedness of white people in order to console me for the wretchedness of blacks. But an itemized account of the American failure does not console me and it should not console anyone else. That hundreds of thousands of white people are living, in effect, no better than the \\"niggers\\" is not a fact to be regarded with complacency. The social and moral bankruptcy suggested by this fact is of the bitterest, most terrifying kind.","What passes for identity in America is a series of myths about one\'s heroic ancestors.","There exists among the intolerable degraded, the perverse and powerful desire to force into the arena of the actual those fantastic crimes of which they have been accused, achieving their vengeance and their own destruction through making the nightmare real.","Hatred destroys the person who hates.","When the South has trouble with its Negroes - when the Negroes refuse to remain in their \\"place\\" - it blames \\"outside agitators\\" and \\"Northern interference.\\" When the nation has trouble with the Northern Negro, it blames the Kremlin.","Everything in life depends on how that life accepts its limits.","An identity would seem to be arrived at by the way in which the person faces and uses his experience.","Any writer, I suppose, feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent.","Then I buckled up my shoes, and I started.","It is astonishing that in a country so devoted to the individual, so many people should be afraid to speak.","I will no longer take anyone\'s word for my experience.","I started reading. I read everything I could get my hands on...By the time I was thirteen I had read myself out of Harlem. I had read every book in two libraries and had a card for the Forty-Second Street branch.","You don\'t need numbers; you need passion, and this is proven by the history of the world!","I think white gay people feel cheated because they were born, in principle, in a society in which they were supposed to be safe. The anomaly of their sexuality puts them in danger, unexpectedly.","No one can possibly know what is about to happen: it is happening, each time, for the first time, for the only time.","America sometimes resembles, at least from the point of view of a black man, an exceedingly monotonous minstrel show; the same dances, same music, same jokes. One has done (or been) the show so long that one can do it in one\u2019s own sleep.","Whoever is born in New York is ill-equipped to deal with any other city: all other cities seem, at best, a mistake, and, at worst, a fraud. No other city is so spitefully incoherent.","But to look back from the stony plain along the road which led one to that place is not at all the same thing as walking on the road; the perspective to say the very least, changes only with the journey; only when the road has, all abruptly and treacherously, and with an absoluteness that permits no argument, turned or dropped or risen is one able to see all that one could not have seen from any other place.","Most of us are about as eager to change as we were to be born, and go through our changes in a similar state of shock.","If the relationship of father to son could really be reduced to biology, the whole earth would blaze with the glory of fathers and sons.","In my case, I think my exile saved my life, for it inexorably confirmed something which Americans appear to have great difficulty accepting. Which is, simply, this: a man is not a man until he is able and willing to accept his own vision of the world, no matter how radically this vision departs from others.","I remember standing on a street corner with the black painter Beauford Delaney down in the Village, waiting for the light to change, and he pointed down and said, \'Look.\' I looked and all I saw was water. And he said, \'Look again,\' which I did, and I saw oil on the water and the city reflected in the puddle. It was a great revelation to me. I can\'t explain it. He taught me how to see, and how to trust what I saw. Painters have often taught writers how to see. And once you\'ve had that experience, you see differently.","People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen forget.","The future is like heaven-everyone exalts it but no one wants to go there now.","It is impossible to pretend that you are not heir to, and therefore, however inadequately or unwillingly, responsible to, and for, the time and place that give you life -- without becoming, at very best, a dangerously disoriented human being.","At bottom, to be colored means that one has been caught in some utterly unbelievable cosmic joke, a joke so hideous and in such bad taste that it defeats all categories and definitions.","Those kids aren\'t dumb. But the people who run these schools want to make sure they don\'t get smart: they are really teaching the kids to be slaves.","History is not a procession of illustrious people. It\'s about what happens to a people. Millions of anonymous people is what history is about.","When the book comes out it may hurt you - but in order for me to do it, it had to hurt me first. I can only tell you about yourself as much as I can face about myself.","Rage cannot be hidden, it can only be dissembled. This dissembling deludes the thoughtless, and strengthens rage and adds, to rage, contempt.","All I know about music is that not many people ever really hear it.","It is a very rare man who does not victimize the helpless.","The noblest spirit is most strongly attracted by the love of glory.","A man\'s balance depends on the weight he carries between his legs.","Youth must be the worst time in anybody\'s life. Everything\'s happening for the first time, which means that sorrow, then, lasts forever. Later, you can see that there was something very beautiful in it. That\'s because you ain\'t got to go through it no more.","Americans, unhappily, have the most remarkable ability to alchemize all bitter truths into an innocuous but piquant confection and to transform their moral contradictions, or public discussion of such contradictions, into a proud decoration, such as are given for heroism on the field of battle.","I met a lot of people in Europe. I even encountered myself.","All of us know, whether or not we are able to admit it, that mirrors can only lie, that death by drowning is all that awaits one there. It is for this reason that love is so desperately sought and so cunningly avoided. Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.","Passion is not friendly. It is arrogant, superbly contemptuous of all that is not itself, and, as they very definition of passion implies the impulse to freedom, it has a might intimidiating power. It contains a challenge. It contains an unspeakable hope.","Freedom lurked around us and I understood, at last, that he could help us be free if we would listen, that he would never be free until we did.","And I was yet aware that this was only a moment, that the world waited outside, as hungry as a tiger, and that trouble stretched above us, longer than the sky.","The face of a lover is an unknown, precisely because it is invested with so much of oneself. It is a mystery, containing, like all mysteries, the possibility of torment.","Whatever white people do not know about Negroes reveals, precisely and inexorably, what they do not know about themselves.","If you\'re treated a certain way you become a certain kind of person. If certain things are described to you as being real they\'re real for you whether they\'re real or not.","Sometimes you hear a person speak the truth and you know that they are speaking the truth. But you also know that they have not heard themselves, do not know what they have said: do not know that they have revealed much more than they have said. This may be why the truth remains, on the whole, so rare.","The states of birth, suffering, love, and death, are extreme states: extreme, universal, and inescapable. We all know this, but we would rather not know it. The artist is present to correct the delusions to which we are all prey in our attempts to avoid this knowledge.\\" - James Baldwin, \\"The Creative Process","People are too various to be treated so lightly. I am too various to be trusted.","Experience, which destroys innocence, also leads one back to it.","It is perfectly possible to be enamoured of Paris while remaining totally indifferent or even hostile to the French.","You took the best, so why not take the rest?","The writer\'s greed is appalling. He wants, or seems to want, everything and practically everybody, in another sense, and at the same time, he needs no one at all.","In overlooking, denying, evading this complexity--which is nothing more than the disquieting complexity of ourselves--we are diminished and we perish; only within this web of ambiguity, paradox, this hunger, danger, darkness, can we find at once ourselves and the power that will free us from ourselves. It is this power of revelation that is the business of the novelist, this journey toward a more vast reality which must take precedence over other claims.","I began plotting novels at about the time I learned to read. The story of my childhood is the usual bleak fantasy, and we can dismiss it with the restrained observation that I certainly would not consider living it again.","After my best friend jumped off the bridge, I knew that I was next. So-Paris. With forty dollars and a one-way ticket.","The betrayal of a belief is not the same thing as ceasing to believe. If this were not so there would be no moral standards in the world at all.","Even the most incorrigible maverick has to be born somewhere. He may leave the group that produced him-he may be forced to-but nothing will efface his origins, the marks of which he carries with him everywhere. I think it is important to know this and even find it a matter for rejoicing, as the strongest people do, regardless of their station. On this acceptance, literally, the life of a writer depends.","You think your pains and heartbreaks are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. [and then you discover that others have suffered much more than you and your problems look good in comparison]","The male cannot bear very much humiliation; and he really cannot bear it, it obliterates him.","I really do believe in the New Jerusalem.  I really do believe that we can all become better than we are.  I know we can.  But the price is enormous and people are not yet willing to pay it.","If you really want to know something about solitude, become famous.","It is a very grave matter to be forced to imitate a people for whom you know-which is the price of your performance and survival-you do not exist. It is hard to imitate a people whose existence appears, mainly, to be made tolerable by their bottomless gratitude that they are not, thank heaven, you.","After departure, only invisible things are left, perhaps the life of the world is held together by invisible chains of memory and loss and love. So many things, so many people, depart! And we can only repossess them in our minds.","Yet I also suspected that what I was seeing was but a part of the truth and perhaps not even the most important part; beneath these faces, these clothes, accents, rudenesses, was power and sorrow, both unadmitted, unrealized, the power of inventors, the sorrow of the disconnected.","The world tends to trap you in the role you play and it is always extremely hard to maintain a watchful, mocking distance between oneself as one appears to be and oneself as one actually is.","Any honest examination of the national life proves how far we are from the standard of human freedom with which we began. The recovery of this standard demands of everyone who loves this country a hard look at himself, for the greatest achievements must begin somewhere, and they always begin with the person.","One can only face in others what one can face in oneself.","The occurrence of an event is not the same thing as knowing what it is that one has lived through.","In order for this to happen, your entire frame of reference will have to change, and you will be forced to surrender many things that you now scarcely know you have.","If we do not now dare everything, the fulfillment of that prophecy, re-created from the Bible in song by a slave, is upon us: God gave Noah the rainbow sign. No more water, fire next time.","The wretched of the earth do not decide to become extinct, they resolve, on the contrary, to multiply: life is their weapon against life, life is all that they have.","Women manage, quite brilliantly, on the whole, and to stunning and unforeseeable effect, to survive and surmount being defined by others. They dismiss the definition, however dangerous or wounding it may be-- or even, sometimes, find a way to utilize it.","We cannot discuss the state of our minorities until we first have some sense of what we are, who we are, what our goals are, and what we take life to be. The question is not what we can do now for the hypothetical Mexican, the hypothetical Negro. The question is what we really want out of life, for ourselves, what we think is real.","The moral authority in the Western world is gone. And it is gone forever. It is gone, not because of the criminal record--everybody\'s record is criminal. It is gone because you cannot do one thing and pretend you\'re doing another! None of us, who are sitting around in some of the true limbo out-of-space, which we call \\"now,\\" waiting to be saved, civilized, or discovered, have the moral authority to say anything.","The South is very beautiful but its beauty makes one sad because the lives that people live here, and have lived here, are so ugly.","I am certainly convinced that it is one of the greatest impulses of mankind to arrive at something higher than a natural state.","No one knows very much about the life of another. This ignorance becomes vivid, if you love another. Love sets the imagination on fire, and, also, eventually, chars the imagination into a harder element: imagination cannot match love, cannot plunge so deep, or range so wide.","He may be a very nice man. But I haven\'t got the time to figure that out. All I know is, he\'s got a uniform and a gun and I have to relate to him that way. That\'s the only way to relate to him because one of us may have to die.","I thought of the people before me who had looked down at the river and gone to sleep beneath it. I wondered about them. I wondered how they had done it--it, the physical act. I simply wondered about the dead because their days had ended and I did not know how I would get through mine.","The miracle is that some have stepped out of the rags of the Republic\'s definition to assume the great burden and glory of their humanity and their responsibility for one another. It is an extraordinary achievement to be trapped in the dungeon of color and to dare to shake down its walls and to step out of it leaving the jailkeeper in the rubble.","Heavenly witnesses are a tricky lot, to be used by whoever is closest to Heaven at the time. And legend and theology, which are designed to sanctify our fears, crimes, and aspirations, also reveal them for what they are.","You go into a book and you\'re in the dark, really. You go in with a certain fear and trembling. You know one thing. You know you will not be the same person when this voyage is over. But you don\'t know what\'s going to happen to you between getting on the boat and stepping off.","An American Negro, however deep his sympathies, or however bright his rage, ceases to be simply a black man when he faces a black man from Africa.","Tell me, he said, \\"What is this thing about time? Why is it better to be late than early? People are always saying, we must wait, we must wait. what are they waiting for?\\" \\"Well [\u2026] I guess people wait in order to make sure of what they feel.\\" \\"And when you have waited\u2014-has it made you sure?","We do not trust educated people and rarely, alas, produce them, for we do not trust the independence of mind which alone makes a genuine education possible.","It happened, as many things do, imperceptibly, in many ways at once. I date it - the slow crumbling of my faith, the pulverization of my fortress - from the time, about a year after I had begun to preach, when I began to read again. I justified this desire by the fact that I was still in school, and I began, fatally, with Dostoyevsky.","We have all had the experience of finding that our reactions and perhaps even our deeds have denied beliefs we thought were ours.","Being in the pulpit, was like being in the theatre; I was behind the scenes and knew how the illusion worked.","But it was not the room\u2019s disorder which was frightening; it was the fact that when one began searching for the key to this disorder, one realized that it was not to be found in any of the usual places. For this was not a matter of habit or circumstance or temperament; it was a matter of punishment and grief.","Such figures as Boy George do not disturb me nearly so much as do those relentlessly hetero (sexual?) keepers of the keys and seals, those who know what the world needs in the way of order and who are ready and willing to supply that order.","An identity is questioned only when it is menaced, as when the mighty begin to fall, or when the wretched begin to rise, or when the stranger enters the gates, never, thereafter, to be a stranger.","I had never before thought of how awful the relationship must be between the musician and his instrument. He has to fill it, this instrument, with the breath of life, his own. He has to make it do what he wants it to do. And a piano is just a piano. It\'s made out of so much wood and wires and little hammers and big ones, and ivory. While there\'s only so much you can do with it, the only way to find this out is to try; to try and make it do everything.","You write in order to change the world.","To ask questions of the universe, and then learn to live with those questions, is the way he achieves his own identity.","It seems to be typical of life in America ... that the second generation has no time to talk to the first.","Europe has what we [Americans] do not have yet, a sense of the mysterious and inexorable limits of life, a sense, in a word, of tragedy. And we have what they sorely need: a sense of life\'s possibilities.","Fonny and I just sat there... while the voices of the congregation rose and rose around us, without mercy... Teddy had the tambourine, and gave the cue to the piano player-I never got to know him: a long dark, evil-looking brother, with hands made for strangling; and with these hands he attacked the keyboard like he was beating the brains out of someone he remembered. No doubt the congregation had their memories, too, and they went to pieces. The church began to rock.","Perhaps, as we say in America, I wanted to find myself. This is an interesting phrase, not current as far as I know in the language of any other people, which certainly does not mean what it says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced. I think now that if I had any intimation that the self I was going to find would turn out to be only the same self from which I had spent so much time in flight, I would have stayed at home.","Years ago, when he was around fourteen, he\'d been all hipped on the idea of going to India. He read books about people sitting on rocks, naked, in all kinds of weather, but mostly bad, naturally, and walking barefoot through hot coals and arriving at wisdom. I used to say that it sounded to me as though they were getting away from wisdom as fast as they could. I think he sort of looked down on me for that.","My friend was about to introduce me when she looked at me and smiled and said, \\"Whose little boy are you?\\"","We cannot discuss the state of our minorities until we first have a sense of what we are, who we are, what our goals are, and what we take life to be.","All over Harlem, Negro boys and girls are growing into stunted maturity, trying desperately to find a place to stand; and the wonder is not that so many are ruined but that so many survive.","The greatest significance of the present student generation is that it is through them that the point of view of the subjugated is finally and inexorably being expressed.","You\'re getting to be a big boy,\' I said desperately, \'it\'s time you started thinking about your future.\' \'I\'m thinking about my future,\' said Sonny, grimly. \'I think about it all the time.","There is a fearful splendor in absolute desolation.","He leaned up a little and watched her face. Her face would now be, forever, more mysterious and impenetrable than the face of any stranger. Strangers\' faces hold no secrets because the imagination does not invest them with any. But the face of a lover is an unknown precisely because it is invested with so much of oneself. It is a mystery, containing, like all mysteries, the possibility of torment.","People who have been wronged will attempt to right the wrong; they would not be people if they didn\'t. They can rarely afford to be scrupulous about the means they will use. They will use such means as come to hand. Neither, in the main, will they distinguish one oppressor from another, nor see through to the root principle of their oppression.","People said that he was very nice, but I confess that his utter grotesqueness made me uneasy; perhaps in the same way that the sight of monkeys eating their own excrement turns some people\u2019s stomachs. They might not mind so much if monkeys did not- so grotesquely- resemble human beings.","When you\u2019re writing, you\u2019re trying to find out something which you don\u2019t know. The whole language of writing for me is finding out what you don\u2019t want to know, what you don\u2019t want to find out. But something forces you to anyway.","I was in his hands, he called me by the thunder at my ear. I was in his hands: I was being changed; all that I could do was cling to him. I did not realize, until I realized it, that I was also kissing him, that everything was breaking and changing and turning in me and moving toward him.","The relatively conscious whites and the relatively conscious blacks, who must, like lovers, insist on, or create, the consciousness of the others in order to end the racial nightmare and acheive our country.","The establishment of democracy on the American continent was scarcely as radical a break with the past as was the necessity, which Americans faced, of broadening this concept to include black men.","Secrets hidden at the heart of midnight are simply waiting to be dragged to the light, as, on some unlucky high noon, they always are. But secrets shrouded in the glare of candor are bound to defeat even the most determined and agile inspector for the light is always changing and proves that the eye cannot be trusted.","The determination to outwit one\'s situation means that one has no models, only object lessons.","We take our shape, it is true, within and against that cage of reality bequeathed us at our birth; and yet it is precisely through our dependence on this reality that we are most endlessly betrayed.","Most people... find a disorientating mismatch between the long-term nature of their liabilities and the increasingly short-term nature of their assets.","Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018Paris is old, is many centuries. You feel, in Paris, all the time gone by. That isn\u2019t what you feel in New York \u2014 \u2019He was smiling. I stopped. \u2018What do you feel in New York?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Perhaps you feel,\u2019 I told him, \u2018all the time to come. There\u2019s such power there, everything is in such movement. You can\u2019t help wondering\u2014I can\u2019t help wondering\u2014what it will all be like\u2014 many years from now.","Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time.","All of Africa will be free before we can get a lousy cup of coffee.","There is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that *they* must accept *you*. The really terrible thing, old buddy, is that you must accept them. And I mean that very seriously. You must accept them and accept them with love.","The making of an American begins at the point where he himself rejects all other ties, any other history, and himself adopts the vesture of his adopted land.","If all you want to do is make money, the very last thing you need is imagination.","how can one respect, let alone adopt, the values of a people who do not, on any level whatever, live the way they say they do, or the way they say they should?","I\'m beginning to think that maybe everything that happens makes sense. Like, if it didn\'t make sense, how could it happen?","There was no room in God\'s army for the coward heart, no crown awaiting him who put mother or father, sister or brother, sweetheart or friend above God\'s will. Let the church cry amen to this!","A ghetto can be improved in one way only: out of existence.","Unless a writer is extremely old when he dies, in which case he has probably become a neglected institution, his death must always seem untimely.","In the invincible and indescribable squalor of Harlem ... I was tormented. I felt caged, like an animal. I wanted to escape. I felt if I did not get out I would slowly strangle.","Negro servants have been smuggling odds and ends out of white homes for generations, and white people have been delighted to have them do it, because it has assuaged a dim guilt and testified to the intrinsic superiority of white people.","Sentimentality, the ostentatious parading of excessive and spurious emotion, is the mark of dishonesty...the wet eyes of the sentimentalist betray his aversion to experience, his fear of life, his arid heart; and it is always, therefore, the signal of secret and violent humanity, the mark of cruelty.","But, when the chips are down, its better to be furious with someone you love, or frightened for someone you love, than be put through the merciless horror of being ashamed of someone you love.","People can cry much easier than they can change, a rule of psychology people like me picked up as kids on the street.","I prefer sinners and madmen, who can learn, who can change, who can teach-or people like myself, if I may say so, who are not afraid to eat a lobster alone as they take on their shoulders the monumental weight of thirty years","James Joyce is right about history being a nightmare-- but it may be that nightmare from which no one can awaken. People are trapped in history and history in trapped in them.","These boys, now, were living as we\'d been living then, they were growing up with a rush and their heads bumped abruptly against the low ceiling of their actual possibilities. They were filled with rage. All they really knew were two darknesses, the darkness of their lives, which were now closing in on them, and the darkness of the movies, which had blinded them to that other darkness, and in which they now, vindictively, dreamed, at once more together than they were at any other time, and more alone.","One is responsible to life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return.","Rage can only with difficulty, and never entirely, be brought under the domination of the intelligence, and therefore is not susceptible to any arguments whatsoever.","She was twenty and had come to realize that, though she had a voice, she wasn\'t a singer; that to endure and embrace the life of a singer demands a whole lot more than a voice.","Whoever is born in New York is ill-equipped to deal with any other city: all other cities seem, at best, a mistake, and, at worst, a fraud. No other city is so spitefully incoherent. Whereas other cities flaunt there history - their presumed glory - in vividly placed monuments, squares, parks, plaques, and boulevards, such history as New York has been unable entirely to obliterate is to be found, mainly, in the backwaters of Wall Street, in the goat tracks of Old and West Broadway, in and around Washington Square, and, for the relentless searcher, in grimly inaccessible regions of The Bronx.","I think Americans are terrified of feeling anything. I never met a people more infantile in my life.","I was guilty and irritated and full of love and pain. I wanted to kick him and I wanted to take him in my arms.","If I could make you stay, I would,\u2019 he shouted. \u2018If I had to beat you, chain you, starve you\u2014if I could make you stay, I would.\u2019 He turned back into the room; the wind blew his hair. He shook his finger at me, grotesquely playful. \u2018One day, perhaps, you will wish I had.","I want to be an honest man and a good writer.","Every legend, moreover, contains its residuum of truth, and the root function of language is to control the universe by describing it.","The American ideal of sexuality appears to be rooted in the American ideal of masculinity. This idea has created cowboys and Indians, good guys and bad guys, punks and studs, tough guys and softies, butch and faggot, black and white. It is an ideal so paralytically infantile that it is virtually forbidden - as an unpatriotic act - that the American boy evolve into the complexity of manhood","I often wonder what I\'d do if there weren\'t any books in the world.","Nakedness has no color: this can come as news only to those who have never covered, or been covered by, another naked human being.","Voyagers discover that the world can never be larger than the person that is in the world; but it is impossible to foresee this, it is impossible to be warned.","Life is more important than art; that\'s what makes art important.","It is only because the world looks on his talent with such a frightening indifference that the artist is compelled to make his talent important.","At four o\'clock in the morning, when everyone is drunk enough, then extraordinary things can happen.","Americans should never come to Europe,\' she said, and tried to laugh and began to cry, \'it means they never can be happy again. What\'s the good of an American who isn\'t happy? Happiness was all we had.","Employment is my right my destiny.","A devotion to humanity is... too easily equated with a devotion to a Cause, and Causes, as we know, are notoriously bloodthirsty.","Christianity has operated with an unmitigated arrogance and cruelty - necessarily, since a religion ordinarily imposes on those who have discovered the true faith the spiritual duty of liberating the infidels.","Confronted with the impossibility of remaining faithful to one\'s beliefs, and the equal impossibility of becoming free of them, one can be driven to the most inhuman excesses.","One writes out of one thing only - one\'s own experience.","The questions which one asks oneself begin, at least, to illuminate the world, and become one\'s key to the experience of others.","It was as though we were a picture, trapped in time: this had been happening for hundreds of years, people sitting in a room, waiting for dinner, and listening to the blues.","The young think that failure is the Siberian end of the line, banishment from all the living, and tend to do what I then did - which was to hide.","European society has always been divided into classes in a way that American society never has been. A European writer considers himself to be part of an old and honorable tradition--of intellectual activity, of letters--and his choice of a vocation does not cause him any uneasy wonder as to whether or not it will cost him all his friends. But this tradition does not exist in America.","There is no way of conveying to the corpse the reasons you have made him one--you have the corpse, and you are, thereafter, at themercy of a fact which missed the truth, which means that the corpse has you.","Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give.","The question of sexual dominance can exist only in the nightmare of that soul which has armed itself, totally, against the possibility of the changing motion of conquest and surrender, which is love.","To hold in the mind forever two ideas which seemed to be in opposition. The first . . . acceptance totally without rancor, of life as it is, and men as they are [;] . . . the second . . . that one must never, in one\'s life, accept . . . injustices as commonplace but must fight them with all one\'s strength.","I don\'t know, now, when I first looked at Hella and found her stale, found her body uninteresting, her presence grating. It seemed to happen all at once\u2014I suppose that only means that it had been happening for a long time.","You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.","Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.","Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death--ought to decide, indeed, to earn one\'s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible for life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return.","I love America more than any other country in the world and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.","All art is a kind of confession, more or less oblique. All artists, if they are to survive, are forced, at last, to tell the whole story; to vomit the anguish up.","People pay for what they do, and still more for what they have allowed themselves to become. And they pay for it very simply; by the lives they lead.","Love takes off the masks we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.","It is very nearly impossible to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind.","Tell me, he said, \\"What is this thing about time? Why is it better to be late than early? People are always saying, we must wait, we must wait. what are they waiting for?\\"\\"Well [\u2026] I guess people wait in order to make sure of what they feel.\\"\\"And when you have waited\u2014-has it made you sure?","For I am\u2014or I was\u2014one of those people who pride themselves in on their willpower, on their ability to make a decision and carry it through. This virtue, like most virtues, is ambiguity itself. People who believe that they are strong-willed and the masters of their destiny can only continue to believe this by becoming specialists in self-deception. Their decisions are not really decisions at all\u2014a real decision makes one humble, one knows that it is at the mercy of more things than can be named\u2014but elaborate systems of evasion, of illusion, designed to make themselves and the world appear to be what they and the world are not. This is certainly what my decision, made so long ago in Joey\u2019s bed, came to. I had decided to allow no room in the universe for something which shamed and frightened me. I succeeded very well\u2014by not looking at the universe, by not looking at myself, by remaining, in effect, in constant motion.","If you cannot love me, I will die. Before you came I wanted to die, I have told you many times. It is cruel to have made me want to live only to make my death more bloody.","The American Negro has the great advantage of having never believed the collection of myths to which white Americans cling: that their ancestors were all freedom-loving heroes, that they were born in the greatest country the world has ever seen, or that Americans are invincible in battle and wise in peace, that Americans have always dealt honorably with Mexicans and Indians and all other neighbors or inferiors, that American men are the world\'s most direct and virile, that American women are pure. Negroes know far more about white Americans than that; it can almost be said, in fact, that they know about white Americans what parents\u2014or, anyway, mothers\u2014know about their children, and that they very often regard white Americans that way. And perhaps this attitude, held in spite of what they know and have endured, helps to explain why Negroes, on the whole, and until lately, have allowed themselves to feel so little hatred. The tendency has really been, insofar as this was possible, to dismiss white people as the slightly mad victims of their own brainwashing.","Those who say it can\'t be done are usually interrupted by others doing it.","The subtle and deadly change of heart that might occur in you would be involved with the realization that a civilization is not destroyed by wicked people; it is not necessary that people be wicked but only that they be spineless.","Our crown has already been bought and paid for. All we have to do is wear it","I thought of the people before me who had looked down at the river and gone to sleep beneath it. I wondered about them. I wondered how they had done it--it, the physical act.I simply wondered about the dead because their days had ended and I did not know how I would get through mine.","You do not,\u2019 cried Giovanni, sitting up, \u2018love anyone! You never have loved anyone, I am sure you never will! You love your purity, you love your mirror\u2014you are just like a little virgin, you walk around with your hands in front of you as though you had some precious metal, gold, silver, rubies, maybe diamonds down there between your legs! You will never give it to anybody, you will never let anybody touch it\u2014man or woman. You want to be clean. You think you came here covered with soap and you think you will go out covered with soap\u2014and you do not want to stink, not even for five minutes, in the meantime.\u2019 He grasped me by the collar, wrestling and caressing at once, fluid and iron at once: saliva spraying from his lips and his eyes full of tears, but with the bones of his face showing and the muscles leaping in his arms and neck. \u2018You want to leave Giovanni because he makes you stink. You want to despise Giovanni because he is not afraid of the stink of love. You want to kill him in the name of all your lying little moralities. And you\u2014you are immoral. You are, by far, the most immoral man I have met in all my life. Look, look what you have done to me. Do you think you could have done this if I did not love you? Is this what you should do to love?","People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget.","Love him,\u2019 said Jacques, with vehemence, \u2018love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters? And how long, at the best, can it last, since you are both men and still have everywhere to go? Only five minutes, I assure you, only five minutes, and most of that, helas! in the dark. And if you think of them as dirty, then they will be dirty\u2014 they will be dirty because you will be giving nothing, you will be despising your flesh and his. But you can make your time together anything but dirty, you can give each other something which will make both of you better\u2014forever\u2014if you will not be ashamed, if you will only not play it safe.\u2019 He paused, watching me, and then looked down to his cognac. \u2018You play it safe long enough,\u2019 he said, in a different tone, \u2018and you\u2019ll end up trapped in your own dirty body, forever and forever and forever\u2014like me.","And this was perhaps the first time in my life that death occurred to me as a reality. I thought of the people before me who had looked down at the river and gone to sleep beneath it. I wondered about them. I wondered how they had done it\u2014it, the physical act. I had thought of suicide when I was much younger, as, possibly, we all have, but then it would have been for revenge, it would have been my way of informing the world how awfully it had made me suffer. But the silence of the evening, as I wandered home, had nothing to do with that storm, that far off boy. I simply wondered about the dead because their days had ended and I did not know how I would get through mine.","If a society permits one portion of its citizenry to be menaced or destroyed, then, very soon, no one in that society is safe. The forces thus released in the people can never be held in check, but run their devouring course, destroying the very foundations which it was imagined they would save.But we are unbelievably ignorant concerning what goes on in our country--to say nothing of what goes on in the rest of the world--and appear to have become too timid to question what we are told. Our failure to trust one another deeply enough to be able to talk to one another has become so great that people with these questions in their hearts do not speak them; our opulence is so pervasive that people who are afraid to lose whatever they think they have persuade themselves of the truth of a lie, and help disseminate it; and God help the innocent here, that man or womn who simply wants to love, and be loved. Unless this would-be lover is able to replace his or her backbone with a steel rod, he or she is doomed. This is no place for love. I know that I am now expected to make a bow in the direction of those millions of unremarked, happy marriages all over America, but I am unable honestly to do so because I find nothing whatever in our moral and social climate--and I am now thinking particularly of the state of our children--to bear witness to their existence. I suspect that when we refer to these happy and so marvelously invisible people, we are simply being nostalgic concerning the happy, simple, God-fearing life which we imagine ourselves once to have lived. In any case, wherever love is found, it unfailingly makes itself felt in the individual, the personal authority of the individual. Judged by this standard, we are a loveless nation. The best that can be said is that some of us are struggling. And what we are struggling against is that death in the heart which leads not only to the shedding of blood, but which reduces human beings to corpses while they live.","Many have given up. They stay home and watch the TV screen, living on the earnings of their parents, cousins, bothers, or uncles, and only leave the house to go to the movies or to the nearest bar. \\"How\'re you making it?\\" on may ask, running into them along the block, or in the bar. \\"Oh, I\'m TV-ing it\\"; with the saddest, sweetest, most shamefaced of smiles, and from a great distance. This distance one is compelled to respect; anyone who has traveled so far will not easily be dragged again into the world. There are further retreats, of course, than the TV screen or the bar. There are those who are simply sitting on their stoops, \\"stoned,\\" animated for a moment only, and hideously, by the approach of someone who may lend them the money for a \\"fix.\\" Or by the approach of someone from whom they can purchase it, one of the shrewd ones, on the way to prison or just coming out.","Perhaps everybody has a garden of Eden, I don\'t know; but they have scarcely seen their garden before they see the flaming sword. Then, perhaps, life only offers the choice of remembering the garden or forgetting it. Either, or: it takes strength to remember, it takes another kind of strength to forget, it takes a hero to do both. People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget. Heroes are rare.","I know what the world has done to my brother and how narrowly he has survived it. And I know, which is much worse, and this is the crime of which I accuse my country and my countrymen, and for which neither I nor time nor history will ever forgive them, that they have destroyed and are destroying hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it. One can be, indeed one must strive to become, tough and philosophical concerning destruction and death, for this is what most of mankind has been best at since we have heard of man. (But remember: most of mankind is not all of mankind.) But it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be innocent. It is the innocence which constitutes the crime.","There is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you. The terrible thing, old buddy, is that you must accept them. And I mean that very seriously. You must accept them and accept them with love. For these innocent people have no other hope. They are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it. They have had to believe for many years, and for innumerable reasons, that black men are inferior to white men. Many of them, indeed, know better, but, as you will discover, people find it very difficult to act on what they know.","You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason. The limits of your ambition were, thus, expected to be set forever. You were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity, and in as many ways as possible, that you were a worthless human being. You were not expected to aspire to excellence: you were expected to make peace with mediocrity. Wherever you have turned, James, in your short time on this earth, you have been told where you could go and what you could do (and how you could do it) and where you could live and whom you could marry. I know your countrymen do not agree with me about this, and I hear them saying \\"You exaggerate.\\" They do not know Harlem, and I do. So do you. Take no one\'s word for anything, including mine- but trust your experience. Know whence you came.","For nothing is fixed, forever and forever and forever, it is not fixed; the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock. Generations do not cease to be born, and we are responsible to them because we are the only witnesses they have. The sea rises, the light fails, lovers cling to each other, and children cling to us. The moment we cease to hold each other, the sea engulfs us and the light goes out.","With everything in me screaming No! yet the sum of me sighed Yes.","To accept one\'s past - one\'s history - is not the same things as drowning in it. An invented past can never be used; it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought.","Passion is not friendly. It is arrogant,superbly contemptuous of all that is notitself, and, as they very definition of passionimplies the impulse to freedom, it has a mightintimidiating power. It contains a challenge.It contains an unspeakable hope.","Any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known it, the loss of all that gave one an identity, the end of safety. And at such a moment, unable to see and not daring to imagine what the future will now bring forth, one clings to what one knew, or dreamed that one possessed. Yet, it is only when a man is able, without bitterness or self-pity, to surrender a dream he has long possessed that he is set free - he has set himself free - for higher dreams, for greater privileges.","We can disagree and still love each other unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist.","I guess it can\u2019t be too often that two people can laugh and make love, too, make love because they are laughing, laugh because they\u2019re making love. The love and the laughter come from the same place: but not many people go there","Colour is not a human or a personal reality; it is a political reality.","...love brought you here. If you trusted love this far, don\'t panic now.","Sentimentality, the ostentatious parading of excessive and spurious emotion, is the mark of dishonesty...the wet eyes of the sentimentalist betray his aversion to experience, his fear of life, his arid heart; and it is always, therefore, the signal of secret and violent inhumanity, the mark of cruelty.","You write in order to change the world, knowing perfectly well that you probably can\'t, but also knowing that literature is indispensable to the world... The world changes according to the way people see it, and if you alter, even but a millimeter the way people look at reality, then you can change it.","Perhaps he is a fool or a coward but almost everybody is one or the other and most people are both.","Literature is indispensable to the world. The world changes according to the way people see it, and if you alter, even by a millimeter, the way a person looks at reality, then you can change it.","The trouble with a secret life is that it is very frequently a secret from the person who lives it and not at all a secret for the people he encounters. He encounters, because he must encounter, those people who see his secrecy before they see anything else, and who drag these secrets out of him; sometimes with the intention of using them against him, sometimes with more benevolent intent; but, whatever the intent, the moment is awful and the accumulating revelation is an unspeakable anguish. The aim of the dreamer, after all, is merely to go on dreaming and not to be molested by the world. His dreams are his protection against the world. But the aims of life are antithetical to those of the dreamer, and the teeth of the world are sharp.","It\'s a miracle to realize that somebody loves you.","Giovanni had awakened an itch, had released a gnaw in me. I realized it one afternoon, when I was taking him to work via the Boulevard Montparnasse. We had bought a kilo of cherries and we were eating them as we walked along. We were both insufferably childish and high-spirited that afternoon and the spectacle we presented, two grown men jostling each other on the wide sidewalk and aiming the cherry pits, as though they were spitballs, into each other\'s faces, must have been outrageous. And I realized that such childishness was fantastic at my age and the happiness out of which it sprang yet more so; for that moment I really loved Giovanni, who had never seemed more beautiful than he was that afternoon.","I am what time, circumstance, history, have made of me, certainly, but I am also so much more than that. So are we all.","Life is tragic simply because the earth turns, and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death \u2013 ought to decide, indeed, to earn one\u2019s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life.","I don\'t like people who like me because I\'m a Negro; neither do I like people who find in the same accident grounds for contempt. I love America more than any other country in the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually. I think all theories are suspect, that the finest principles may have to be modified, or may even be pulverized by the demands of life, and that one must find, therefore, one\'s own moral center and move through the world hoping that this center will guide one aright. I consider that I have many responsibilities, but none greater than this: to last, as Hemingway says, and get my work done.I want to be an honest man and a good writer.","I can\'t be a pessimist because I am alive. To be a pessimist means that you have agreed that human life is an academic matter. So, I am forced to be an optimist. I am forced to believe that we can survive, whatever we must survive.","The American ideal, after all, is that everyone should be as much alike as possible.","I hope that nobody has ever had to look at anybody they love through glass.","Most of us are about as eager to be changed as we were to be born, and go through our changes in a similar state of shock.","If one wishes to be instructed--not that anyone does--concerning the treacherous role that memory plays in a human life, consider how relentlessly the water of memory refuses to break, how it impedes that journey into the air of time. Time: the whisper beneath that word is death. With this unanswerable weight hanging heavier and heavier over one\'s head, the vision becomes cloudy, nothing is what it seems... How then, can I trust my memory concerning that particular Sunday afternoon?...Beneath the face of anyone you ever loved for true--anyone you love, you will always love, love is not at the mercy of time and it does not recognize death, they are strangers to each other--beneath the face of the beloved, however ancient, ruined, and scarred, is the face of the baby your love once was, and will always be, for you. Love serves, then, if memory doesn\'t, and passion, apart from its tense relation to agony, labors beneath the shadow of death. Passion is terrifying, it can rock you, change you, bring your head under, as when a wind rises from the bottom of the sea, and you\'re out there in the craft of your mortality, alone.","Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018Paris is old, is many centuries. You feel, in Paris, all the time gone by. That isn\u2019t what you feel in New York \u2014 \u2019He was smiling. I stopped.\u2018What do you feel in New York?\u2019 he asked.\u2018Perhaps you feel,\u2019 I told him, \u2018all the time to come. There\u2019s such power there, everything is in such movement. You can\u2019t help wondering\u2014I can\u2019t help wondering\u2014what it will all be like\u2014many years from now.","No one is more dangerous than he who imagines himself pure in heart: for his purity, by definition, is unassailable.","I am what time, circumstance, history, have made of me, certainly, but I am, also, much more than that. So are we all.","The sea rises, the light fails, lovers cling to each other, and children cling to us. The moment we cease to hold each other, the moment we break faith with one another, the sea engulfs us and the light goes out.","Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have.","And with every step I took it became more impossible for me to turn back. And my mind was empty\u2014or it was as though my mind had become one enormous, anaesthetized wound. I thought only, One day I\'ll weep for this. One of these days I\'ll start to cry.","Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death\u2014ought to decide, indeed, to earn one\'s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible to life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return. One must negotiate this passage as nobly as possible, for the sake of those who are coming after us.","For these are all our children, we will all profit by or pay for what they become.","I can\'t be a pessimist because I\'m alive. To be a pessimist means that you have agreed that human life is an academic matter.","There is an illusion about America, a myth about America to which we are clinging which has nothing to do with the lives we lead and I don\'t believe that anybody in this country who has really thought about it or really almost anybody who has been brought up against it--and almost all of us have one way or another--this collision between one\'s image of oneself and what one actually is is always very painful and there are two things you can do about it, you can meet the collision head-on and try and become what you really are or you can retreat and try to remain what you thought you were, which is a fantasy, in which you will certainly perish.","I have met only a very few people - and most of these were not Americans - who had any real desire to be free. Freedom is hard to bear. It can be objected that I am speaking of political freedom in spiritual terms, but the political institutions of any nation are always menaced and are ultimately controlled by the spiritual state of that nation. We are controlled here by our confusion, far more than we know, and the American dream has therefore become something much more closely resembling a nightmare, on the private, domestic, and international levels. Privately, we cannot stand our lives and dare not examine them; domestically, we take no responsibility for (and no pride in) what goes on in our country; and, internationally, for many millions of people, we are an unmitigated disaster. Whoever doubts this last statement has only to open his ears, his heart, his mind, to the testimony of - for example - any Cuban peasant or any Spanish poet, and ask himself what he would feel about us if he were the victim of our performance in pre-Castro Cuba or in Spain. We defend our curious role in Spain by referring to the Russian menace and the necessity of protecting the free world. It has not occurred to us that we have simply been mesmerized by Russia, and that the only real advantage Russia has in what we think of as a struggle between the East and the West is the moral history of the Western world. Russia\'s secret weapon is the bewilderment and despair and hunger of millions of people of whose existence we are scarecely aware. The Russian Communists are not in the least concerned about these people. But our ignorance and indecision have had the effect, if not of delivering them into Russian hands, of plunging them very deeply in the Russian shadow, for which effect - and it is hard to blame them - the most articulate among them, and the most oppressed as well, distrust us all the more... We are capable of bearing a great burden, once we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is. Anyway, the point here is that we are living in an age of revolution, whether we will or no, and that America is the only Western nation with both the power, and, as I hope to suggest, the experience that may help to make these revolutions real and minimize the human damage.","History is not the past. It is the present. We carry our history with us. We are our history. If we pretend otherwise, we are literally criminals. I attest to this: the world is not white; it never was white, cannot be white. White is a metaphor for power, and that is simply a way of describing Chase Manhattan Bank.","There appears to be a vast amount of confusion on this point, but I do not know many Negroes who are eager to be \\"accepted\\" by white people, still less to be loved by them; they, the blacks, simply don\'t wish to be beaten over the head by the whites every instant of our brief passage on this planet. White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this -- which will not be tomorrow and will not be today and may very well be never -- the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.","It began to seem that one would have to hold in the mind forever two ideas which seemed to be in opposition. The first idea was acceptance, the acceptance, totally without rancor, of life as it is, and men as they are: in the light of this idea, it goes without saying that injustice is a commonplace. But this did not mean that one could be complacent, for the second idea was of equal power: that one must never, in one\'s own life, accept these injustices as commonplace but must fight them with all one\'s strength. This fight begins, however, in the heart and it now had been laid to my charge to keep my own heart free of hatred and despair. This intimation made my heart heavy and, now that my father was irrecoverable, I wished that he had been beside me so that I could have searched his face for the answers which only the future would give me now.","If dirty words frighten you...I really don\u2019t know how you have managed to live so long. People are full of dirty words. The only time they do not use them, most people I mean, is when they are describing something dirty.","Perhaps everybody has a garden of Eden, I don\'t know; but they have scarcely seen their garden before they see the flaming sword. Then, perhaps, life only offers the choice of remembering the garden or forgetting it. Either, or: it takes strength to remember, it takes another kind of strength to forget, it takes a hero to do both.","One writes out of one thing only--one\'s own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give. This is the only real concern of the artist, to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art.","Love was a country he knew nothing about.","Art has to be a kind of confession. I don\u2019t mean a true confession in the sense of that dreary magazine. The effort it seems to me, is: if you can examine and face your life, you can discover the terms with which you are connected to other lives, and they can discover them, too \u2014 the terms with which they are connected to other people. This has happened to every one of us, I\u2019m sure. You read something which you thought only happened to you, and you discovered it happened 100 years ago to Dostoyevsky. This is a very great liberation for the suffering, struggling person, who always thinks that they are alone. This is why art is important. Art would not be important if life were not important, and life is important. Most of us, no matter what we say, are walking in the dark, whistling in the dark. Nobody knows what is going to happen to them from one moment to the next, or how one will bear it. This is irreducible. And it\u2019s true for everybody. Now, it is true that the nature of society is to create, among its citizens, an illusion of safety; but it is also absolutely true that the safety is always necessarily an illusion. Artists are here to disturb the peace. They have to disturb the peace. Otherwise, chaos.","Whose little boy are you?","One of the most terrible, most mysterious things about a life is that a warning can be heeded only in retrospect: too late.","We should certainly know by now that it is one thing to overthrow a dictator or repel an invader and quite another thing really to achieve a revolution. Time and time and time again, the people discover that they have merely betrayed themselves into the hands of yet another Pharaoh who, since he was necessary to put the broken country together, will not let them go.","Please try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do and cause you to endure, does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear.","White people...have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this -- which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never -- the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.","And if the word integration means anything, this is what it means: that we, with love, shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it. For this is your home, my friend, do not be driven from it; great men have done great things here, and will again, and we can make America what America must become.","What white people have to do is try and find out in their own hearts why it is necessary to have a \'nigger\' in the first place, because I\'m not a nigger. I\'m a man. But if you think I\'m a nigger, it means you need it.","The summer ended. Day by day, and taking its time, the summer ended. The noises in the street began to change, diminish, voices became fewer, the music sparse. Daily, blocks and blocks of children were spirited away. Grownups retreated from the streets, into the houses. Adolescents moved from the sidewalk to the stoop to the hallway to the stairs, and rooftops were abandoned. Such trees as there were allowed their leaves to fall - they fell unnoticed - seeming to promise, not without bitterness, to endure another year. At night, from a distance, the parks and playgrounds seemed inhabited by fireflies, and the night came sooner, inched in closer, fell with a greater weight. The sound of the alarm clock conquered the sound of the tambourine, the houses put on their winter faces. The houses stared down a bitter landscape, seeming, not without bitterness, to have resolved to endure another year.","She knows Daddy better than I do. I think it\'s because she\'s felt since we were children that our Daddy maybe loved me more than he loves her. This isn\'t true, and she knows that now--people love different people in different ways--but it must have seemed that way to her when we were little. I look as though I just can\'t make it, she looks like can\'t nothing stop her. If you look helpless, people react to you in one way and if you look strong, or just come on strong, people react to you in another way, and, since you don\'t see what they see, this can be very painful. I think that\'s why Sis was always in front of that damn mirror all the time, when we were kids. She was saying, \'I don\'t care. I got me.\' Of course, this only made her come on stronger than ever, which was the last effect she desired: but that\'s the way we are and that\'s how we can sometimes get so fucked up. Anyway, she\'s past all that. She knows who she is, or, at least, she knows who she damn well isn\'t.","You think...that my life is shameful because my encounters are. And they are. But you should ask yourself why they are.Why are they\u2014shameful?Because there is no affection in them, and no joy. It\u2019s like putting an electric plug in a dead socket. Touch, but no contact. All touch, but no contact and no light.","You read something which you thought only happened to you, and you discover that it happened 100 years ago to Dostoyevsky. This is a very great liberation for the suffering, struggling person, who always thinks that he is alone. This is why art is important.","It is easy to proclaim all souls equal in the sight of God; it is hard to make men equal on earth in the sight of men.","If we- and now I mean the relatively conscious whites and the relatively conscious blacks, who must, like lovers, insist on, or create, the consciousness of the others- do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world","We don\u2019t know enough about ourselves. I think it\u2019s better to know that you don\u2019t know, that way you can grow with the mystery as the mystery grows in you. But, these days, of course, everybody knows everything, that\u2019s why so many people are so lost.","It takes strength to remember, it takes another kind of strength to forget, it takes a hero to do both. People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget. Heroes are rare.","Money, iit turned out, was exactly like sex, you thought of nothing else if you didn\'t have it and thought of otherthings if you did.","It\'s astounding the first time you realize that a stranger has a body - the realization that he has a body makes him a stranger. It means that you have a body, too. You will live with this forever, and it will spell out the language of your life.","To accept one\'s past\u2014one\'s history\u2014is not the same thing as drowning it it; it is learning how to use it. An invented past can never be used; it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought.","Every white person in this country-and I do not care what he or she says-knows one thing. They may not know, as they put, \\"what I want\\",but they know they would not like to be black here.If they know that, then they know everything they need to know, and whatever else they say is a lie.","Only a man can see in the face of a woman the girl she was. It is a secret which can be revealed only to a particular man, and, then, only at his insistence. But men have no secrets, except from women, and never grow up in the way women do. It is very much harder, and it takes much longer, for a man to grow up, and he could never do it at all without women. This is a mystery which can terrify and immobilize a woman, and it is always the key to her deepest distress. She must watch and guide, but he must lead, and he will always appear to be giving far more of his real attention to his comrades than he is giving to her. But that noisy, outward openness of men with each other enables them to deal with the silence and secrecy of women, that silence and secrecy which contains the truth of a man, and releases it. I suppose that the root of the resentment\u2014a resentment which hides a bottomless terror\u2014has to do with the fact that a woman is tremendously controlled by what the man\u2019s imagination makes of her\u2014literally, hour by hour, day by day; so she becomes a woman. But a man exists in his own imagination, and can never be at the mercy of a woman\u2019s.\u2014Anyway, in this fucked up time and place, the whole thing becomes ridiculous when you realize that women are supposed to be more imaginative than men. This is an idea dreamed up by men, and it proves exactly the contrary. The truth is that dealing with the reality of men leaves a woman very little time, or need, for imagination. And you can get very fucked up, here, once you take seriously the notion that a man who is not afraid to trust his imagination (which is all that men have ever trusted) if effeminate. It says a lot about this country, because, of course, if all you want to do is make money, the very last thing you need is imagination. Or women, for that matter: or men.","It was a gesture of great despair and I knew that she was giving herself, not to me, but to that lover who would never come.","You don\'t know what\'s happening on the other side of the wall, because you don\'t want to know.","The Constitution gives you the right, as a white man, to have a rifle in your home. The Constitution gives you the right to protect yourself. Why is it \u2018ominous\u2019 when black people even talk of having rifles? Why don\u2019t we have the right to self-defense? Is it because maybe you know we\u2019re going to have to defend ourselves against you?","This was the last time I ever saw my mother alive. Just the same, this picture gets all mixed up in my mind with pictures I had of her when she was younger. The way I always see her is the way she used to be on Sunday afternoon, say, when the old folks were talking after the big Sunday dinner. I always see her wearing pale blue. She\'d be sitting on the sofa. And my father would be sitting in the easy chair, not far from her. And the living room would be full of church folks and relatives. There they sit, in chairs all around the living room, and the night is creeping up outside, but nobody knows it yet. You can see the darkness growing against the windowpanes and you hear the street noises every now and again, or maybe the jangling beat of a tambourine from one of the churches close by, but it\'s real quiet in the room. For a moment nobody\'s talking, but every face looks darkening, like the sky outside. And my mother rocks a little from the waist, and my father\'s eyes are closed. Everyone is looking at something a child can\'t see. For a minute they\'ve forgotten the children. Maybe a kid is lying on the rug, half asleep. Maybe somebody\'s got a kid in his lap and is absent-mindedly stroking the kid\'s head. Maybe there\'s a kid, quiet and big-eyed, curled up in a big chair in the corner. The silence, the darkness coming, and the darkness in the faces frighten the child obscurely. He hopes that the hand which strokes his forehead will never stop-- will never die. He hopes that there will never come a time when the old folks won\'t be sitting around the living room, talking about where they\'ve come from, and what they\'ve seen, and what\'s happened to them and their kinfolk.But something deep and watchful in the child knows that this is bound to end, is already ending. In a moment someone will get up and turn on the light. Then the old folks will remember the children and they won\'t talk anymore that day. And when light fills the room, the child is filled with darkness. He knows that every time this happens he\'s moved just a little closer to that darkness outside. The darkness outside is what the old folks have been talking about. It\'s what they\'ve come from. It\'s what they endure. The child knows that they won\'t talk anymore because if he knows too much about what\'s happened to them, he\'ll know too much too soon, about what\'s going to happen to him.","People are not, for example, terribly anxious to be equal (equal, after all, to what and to whom?) but they love the idea of being superior.","I simply wondered about the dead because their days had ended and I did not know how I would get through mine.","Nobody can stay in the garden of Eden,\\" Jacques said. And then: \\"I wonder why.","Then I wanted to beg him to forgive me. But this would have been too great a confession; any yielding at that moment would have locked me forever in that room with him. And in a way this was exactly what I wanted.","Being in trouble can have a funny effect on the mind. I don\'t know if I can explain this. You go through some days and you seem to be hearing people and you seem to be talking to them and you seem to be doing your work, or, at least, your work gets done; but you haven\'t seen or heard a soul and if someone asked you what you have done that day you\'d have to think awhile before you could answer. But at the same time, and even on the self-same day-- and this is what is hard to explain--you see people like you never saw them before.","Time: the word tolled like the bells of a church. Fonny was doing: time. In six months time, our baby would be here. Somewhere, in time, Fonny and I had met: somewhere, in time, we had loved; somewhere, no longer in time, but, now, totally, at time\u2019s mercy, we loved.","In my experience - and this is a very awkward way to put it, since I don\'t really know what the word experience means - the strangest people in one\'s life are the people one has known and loved, still know and will always love. Here, both I and the vocabulary are both in trouble, for strangest does not imply stranger. A stranger is a stranger is a stranger, simply, and you watch the stranger to anticipate his next move. But the people who elicit from you a depth of attention and wonder which we helplessly call love are perpetually making moves which cannot possibly be anticipated. Eventually, you realize that it never occurred to you to anticipate their next move, not only because you couldn\'t but because you didn\'t have to: it was not a question of moving on the next move, but simply, of being present. Danger, true, you try to anticipate and you prepare yourself, without knowing it, to stand in the way of death. For the strangest people in the world are those people recognized, beneath one\'s senses, by one\'s soul - the people utterly indispensable for one\'s journey.","The very time I thought I was lost, my dungeon shook and my chains fell off.","Dickens has not seen it all. The wretched of the earth do not decide to become extinct, they resolve, on the contrary, to multiply: life is their only weapon against life, life is all that they have. This is why the dispossessed and starving will never be convinced (though some may be coerced) by the population-control programs of the civilized. I have watched the dispossessed and starving laboring in the fields which others own, with their transistor radios at their ear, all day long: so they learn, for example, along with equally weighty matters, that the pope, one of the heads of the civilized world, forbids to the civilized that abortion which is being, literally, forced on them, the wretched. The civilized have created the wretched, quite coldly and deliberately, and do not intend to change the status quo; are responsible for their slaughter and enslavement; rain down bombs on defenseless children whenever and wherever they decide that their \u2018vital interests\u2019 are menaced, and think nothing of torturing a man to death: these people are not to be taken seriously when they speak of the \u2018sanctity\u2019 of human life, or the \u2018conscience\u2019 of the civilized world. There is a \u2018sanctity\u2019 involved with bringing a child into this world: it is better than bombing one out of it. Dreadful indeed it is to see a starving child, but the answer to that is not to prevent the child\u2019s arrival but to restructure the world so that the child can live in it: so that the \u2018vital interest\u2019 of the world becomes nothing less than the life of the child. However\u2014I could not have said any of this then, nor is so absurd a notion about to engulf the world now. But we were all starving children, after all, and none of our fathers, even at their most embittered and enraged, had ever suggested that we \u2018die out.\u2019 It was not we who were supposed to die out: this was, of all notions, the most forbidden, and we learned this from the cradle. Every trial, every beating, every drop of blood, every tear, were meant to be used by us for a day that was coming\u2014for a day that was certainly coming, absolutely certainly, certainly coming: not for us, perhaps, but for our children. The children of the despised and rejected are menaced from the moment they stir in the womb, and are therefore sacred in a way that the children of the saved are not. And the children know it, which is how they manage to raise their children, and why they will not be persuaded\u2014by their children\u2019s murderers, after all\u2014to cease having children.","Don\u2019t let it make you bitter. Try to understand. Try to understand. The world\u2019s already bitter enough, we got to try to be better than the world.","The American revolution, the terms are these: not that I drive you out or that you drive me out, but that we come together and embrace and learn to live together. That is the only way that we can have achieved the American revolution. Now, if we can face this, it involves facing a great many things. It demands that white people face the fact that I, for example, or any black person they will ever meet or have ever met\u2014I am not an exotic rarity. I am not a stranger. I am none of those things. On the contrary, for all you know, for all you know, I might be your uncle, your brother, your cousin, among other things. One of the things that has happened here\u2014and the pathology of the Deep South proves it; so does the pathology of the North, which dictates to them that they move out and I move in\u2014among other things which have to be excavated here is the fact that this long history is also the history of a love affair.","Any writer, I suppose, feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent--which attitude certainly has a great deal to support it. On the other hand, it is only because the world looks on his talent with such frightening indifference that the artist is compelled to make his talent important.","The glorification of one race and the consequent debasement of another\u2014or others\u2014always has been and always will be a recipe for murder. There is no way around this. If one is permitted to treat any group of people with special disfavor because of their race or the color of their skin, there is no limit to what one will force them to endure, and, since the entire race has been mysteriously indicted, no reason not to attempt to destroy it root and branch.","I remember what it was...to be young, very young. When everything, touching and tasting-everything- was so new, and even suffering was wonderful because it was so complete.","Until I die there will be those moments, moments seeming to rise up out of the ground like Macbeth\'s witches, when his face will come before me, that face in all its changes, when the exact timbre of his voice and tricks of his speech will nearly burst my ears, when his smell will overpower my nostrils. Sometimes, in the days which are coming--God grant me the grace to live them-- in the glare of the grey morning, sour-mouthed, eyelids raw and red, hair tangled and damp from stormy sleep, facing, over coffee and cigarette smoke, last night\'s impenetrable, meaningless boy who will shortly rise and vanish like the smoke, I will see Giovanni again, as he was that night, so vivid, so winning, all of the light of that gloomy tunnel trapped around his head.","I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain.","You can not describe anything without betraying your point of view, your aspirations, your fears, your hopes. Everything.","I know that people can be better than they are. We are capable of bearing a great burden, once we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is.","Perhaps now, though, he had hit bottom. One thing about the bottom, he told himself, you can\'t fall any further. He tried to take comfort from this thought. Yet there knocked in his heart the suspicion that the bottom did not really exist.","It is not too much to say that whoever wishes to become a truly moral human being ... must first divorce himself from all the prohibitions, crimes, and hypocrisies of the Christian church. If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time we got rid of Him.","I remembered that life in that room seemed to be occuring beneath the sea, time flowed past indiffrently above us, hours and days had no meaning.","Incontestably, alas, most people are not, in action, worth very much; and yet, every human being is an unprecedented miracle. One tries to treat them as the miracles they are, while trying to protect oneself against the disasters they\u2019ve become.","I was in a terrible confusion. Sometimes I thought, but this is your life. Stop fighting it. Stop fighting. Or I thought, but I am happy. And he loves me. I am safe. Sometimes, when he was not near me, I thought, I will never let him touch me again. Then, when he touched me, I thought it doesn\u2019t matter, it is only the body, it will soon be over. When it was over I lay in the dark and listened to his breathing and dreamed of the touch of hands, of Giovanni\u2019s hands, or anybody\u2019s hands, hands which would have the power to crush me and make me whole again.","You never had to look at me. I had to look at you. I know more about you than you know about me. Not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.","All that hatred down there,\\" he said, \\"all that hatred and misery and love. It\'s a wonder it doesn\'t blow the avenue apart.","The time has come to realize that the interracial drama acted out on the American continent has not only created a new black man, it has created a new white man, too. No road whatever will lead Americans back to the simplicity of this European village where white men still have the luxury of looking on me as a stranger. I am not, really, a stranger any longer for any American alive. One of the things that distinguishes Americans from other people is that no other people has ever been so deeply involved in the lives of black men, and vice versa. This fact faced, with all its implications, it can be seen that the history of the American Negro problem is not merely shameful, it is also something of an achievement. For even when the worst has been said, it must also be added that the perpetual challenge posed by this problem was always, somehow, perpetually met. It is precisely this black-white experience which may prove of indispensable value to us in the world we face today. This world is white no longer, and it will never be white again.","Sentimentality, the ostentatious parading of excessive and spurious emotion, is the mark of dishonesty, the inability to feel; the wet eyes of the sentimentalist betray his aversion to experience, his fear of life, his arid heart; and it is always, therefore, the signal of secret and violent inhumanity, the mask of cruelty.","It is rare indeed that people give. Most people guard and keep; they suppose that it is they themselves and what they identify with themselves that they are guarding and keeping, whereas what they are actually guarding and keeping is their system of reality and what they assume themselves to be. One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself -- that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving.","It doesn\'t do any good to fight with Sonny. Sonny just moves back, inside himself, where he can\'t be reached.","She fitted in my arms, she always had, and the shock of holding her caused me to feel that my arms had been empty since she had been away.","White Americans find it as difficult as white people elsewhere do to divest themselves of the notion that they are in possession of some intrinsic value that black people need, or want. And this assumption\u2014which, for example, makes the solution to the Negro problem depend on the speed with which Negroes accept and adopt white standards\u2014is revealed in all kinds of striking ways, from Bobby Kennedy\'s assurance that a Negro can become President in forty years to the unfortunate tone of warm congratulation with which so many liberals address their Negro equals.","The question is banal but one of the real troubles with living is that living is so banal. Everyone, after all, goes the same dark road \u2014 and the road has a trick of being most dark, most treacherous, when it seems most bright \u2014 and it\u2019s true that nobody stays in the garden of Eden...Perhaps everybody has a garden of Eden, I don\u2019t know; but they have scarcely seen their garden before they see the flaming sword. Then, perhaps, life only offers the choice of remembering the garden or forgetting it. Either, or: it takes strength to remember, it takes another kind of strength to forget, it takes a hero to do both. People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget. Heroes are rare.","Time is just common, it\'s like water for a fish. Everybody\'s in this water, nobody gets out of it, or if he does the same thing happens to him that happens to the fish, he dies. And you know what happens in this water, time? The big fish eat the little fish. That\'s all. The big fish eat the little fish and the ocean doesn\'t care.","If one is continually surviving the worst that life can bring, one eventually ceases to be controlled by a fear of what life can bring; whatever it bring must be borne. And at this level of experience one\'s bitterness begins to be palatable, and hatred becomes too heavy a sack to carry.","This past, this endless struggle to achieve and reveal and confirm a human identity, human authority, yet contains, for all its horror, something very beautiful. I do not mean to be sentimental about suffering \u2013 enough is certainly as good as a feast \u2013 but people who cannot suffer can never grow up, can never discover who they are. That man who is forced each day to snatch his manhood, his identity, out of the fire of human cruelty that rages to destroy it knows, if he survives his effort, and even if he does not survive it, something about himself and human life that no school on earth \u2013 and indeed, no church \u2013 can teach. He achieves his own authority, and that is unshakable. This is because, in order to save his life, he is forced to look beneath appearances, to take nothing for granted, to hear the meaning behind the words. If one is continually surviving the worse that life can bring, one eventually ceases to be controlled by a fear of what life can bring; whatever it brings must be borne. And at this level of experience one\u2019s bitterness begins to be palatable, and hatred becomes too heavy a sack to carry.","The face of a lover is an unknown, precisely because it is invested so much within oneself. It is a mystery, containing, like all mysteries, the possibility of torment.","But it\u2019s not possible to forget anybody you were that hung up on, who was that hung up on you. You can\u2019t forget anything that hurt so badly, went so deep, and changed the world forever. It\u2019s not possible to forget anybody you\u2019ve destroyed.","What are you doing all the time? And why do you say nothing? You are evil, you know, and sometimes when you smiled at me I hated you. I wanted to strike you. I wanted to make you bleed. You smiled at me the way you smiled at everyone, you told me what you told everyone\u2014 and you tell nothing but lies. What are you always hiding? And do you think I did not know when you made love to me, you were making love to no one? No one! Or everyone\u2014but not me, certainly. I am nothing to you, nothing, and you bring me fever but no delight.","Though we do not wholly believe it yet, the interior life is a real life, and the intangible dreams of people have a tangible effect on the world.","Take no one\u2019s word for anything, including mine - but trust your experience.","And they didn\'t even read; depressed populations don\'t have the time or energy to spare. The affluent populations, which should have been their help, didn\'t, as far as could be discovered, read either\u2014they merely bought books and devoured them, but not in order to learn: in order to learn new attitudes.","The details and symbols of your life have been deliberately constructed to make you believe what white people say about you. Please try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do and cause you to endure, does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear.","We held each other so close that we might indeed have been one body.","It\u2019s a long way, John said slowly, \u201cain\u2019t it? It\u2019s a hard way. It\u2019s uphill all the way.\u201d","The root of the black man\'s hatred is rage, and he does not so much had the white manas simply as want the out of his way,and, more than that,out of his children\'s way. The root of the white man\'s hatred is terror, a bottomless and nameless terror, which focuses on this dread figure, an entity which lives only in his mind.","All of us know, whether or not we are able to admit it, that mirrors can only lie, that death by drowning is all that awaits one there. It is for this reason that love is so desperately sought and so cunningly avoided. Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within. I use the word \\"love\\" here not merely in the personal sense but as a state of being, or a state of grace--not in the infantile American sense of being made happy but in the tough and universal sense of quest and daring and growth.","Now, one hears from a long time ago that \\"white is merely a state of mind.\\" I add to that, white is a moral choice. It\'s up to you to be as white as you want to be and pay the price of that ticket. You cannot tell a black man by the color of skin, either. But this is a democracy.","Not a thousand years ago, it was illegal to teach a slave to read. Not a thousand years ago, the Supreme Court decided that separate could not be equal. And today, as we sit here, no one is learning anything in this country. You see a nation which is the leader of the rest of the world, that had to pay the price of that ticket, and the price of that ticket is we\'re sitting in the most illiterate nation in the world. THE MOST ILLITERATE NATION IN THE WORLD. A monument to illiteracy. And if you doubt me, all you have to do is spend a day in Washington. I am serious as a heart attack.","Until i die there will be these moments, moments seeming to rise up out of the ground like Macbeth\'s witches, when his face will come before me, that face in all its changes, when the exact timbre of his voice and tricks of his speech will nearly burst my ears, when his smell will overpower my nostrils.

We don\'t know enough about ourselves. I think it\'s better to know that you don\'t know, that way you can grow with the mystery as the mystery grows in you. But, these days, of course, everybody knows everything, that\'s why so many people are so lost.","Of course, I must say that I don\'t think America is God\'s gift to anybody--if it is, God\'s days have got to be numbered. That God these people say they serve--and do serve, in ways that they don\'t know--has got a very nasty sense of humor. Like you\'d beat the shit out of Him, if He was a man. Or: if you were.","He smiled, \\"Why, you will go home and then you will find that home is not home anymore. Then you will really be in trouble. As long as you stay here, you can always think: One day I will go home.\\" He played with my thumb and grinned. \\"N\'est-ce pas?\\"\\"Beautiful logic,\\" I said. \\"You mean I have a home to go to as long as I don\'t go there?\\"He laughed. \\"Well, isn\'t it true? You don\'t have a home until you leave it and then, when you have left it, you never can go back.","But I felt that it was my heart which was broken. Something had broken in me to make me so cold and so perfectly still and far away.","People who believe that they are strong-willed and the masters of their destiny can only continue to believe this by becoming specialists in self-deception. Their decisions are not really decisions at all\u2014a real decision makes one humble, one knows that it is at the mercy of more things than can be named\u2014but elaborate systems of evasion, of illusion, designed to make themselves and the world appear to be what they and the world are not.","The morning of that day, as Gabriel rose and started out to work, the sky was low and nearly black and the air too thick to breath. Late in the afternoon the wind rose, the skies opened, and the rain came. The rain came down as though once more in Heaven the Lord had been persuaded of the good uses of a flood. It drove before it the bowed wanderer, clapped children into houses, licked with fearful anger against the high, strong wall, and the wall of the lean-to, and the wall of the cabin, beat against the bark and the leaves of trees, trampled the broad grass, and broke the neck of the flower. The world turned dark, forever, everywhere, and windows ran as though their glass panes bore all the tears of eternity, threatening at every instant to shatter inward against this force, uncontrollable, so abruptly visited on the earth.","In the realm of power, Christianity has operated with an unmitigated arrogance and cruelty\u2014necessarily, since a religion ordinarily imposes on those who have discovered the true faith the spiritual duty of liberating the infidels. This particular true faith, moreover, is more deeply concerned about the soul than it is about the body, to which fact the flesh (and the corpses) of countless infidels bears witness.","A real decision makes one humble, one knows that it is at the mercy of more things that can be named.","His mind was like the sea itself: troubled, and too deep for the bravest man\'s descent, throwing up now and again, for the naked eye to wonder at, treasure and debris long forgotten on the bottom\u2014bones and jewels, fantastic shells, jelly that had once been flesh, pearls that had once been eyes. And he was at the mercy of this sea, hanging there with darkness all around him.","All the western nations are caught in a lie, the lie of their pretended humanism: this means that their history has no moral justification, and that the West has no moral authority.","Sometimes, when he was not near me, I thought, I will never let him \'Touch\' me again. Then, when he \'Touched\' me, I thought, it doesn\'t matter, it is only the body, it will soon be over. When it was over, I lay in the dark and listened to his breathing and dreamed of the \'Touch\' of hands, of Giovanni\'s hands, or anybody\'s hands, hands which would have the power to crush me and make me whole again.","I remember that life in that room seemed to be occurring beneath the sea, time flowed past indifferently above us, hours and days had no meaning. In the beginning our life held a joy and amazement which was newborn every day. Beneath the joy, of course, was anguish and beneath the amazement was fear; but they did not work themselves to the beginning until our high beginning was aloes on our tongues. By then anguish and fear had become the surface on which we slipped and slid, losing balance, dignity, and pride.","And yet - when one begins to search for the crucial, the definitive moment, the moment which changed all others, one finds one-self pressing, in great pain, through a maze of false signals and abruptly locking doors.","Why am I going home? he asked himself. But he knew why. It was time. In order not to lose all that he had gained, he had to move forward and risk it all.","It\'s terrible sometimes, inside,\\" he said, \\"that\'s what\'s the trouble. You walk these streets, black and funky and cold, and there\'s not really a living ass to talk to, and there\'s nothing shaking, and there\'s no way of getting it out- that storm inside. You can\'t talk it and you can\'t make love with it, and when you finally try to get with it and play it, you realize nobody\'s listening. So you\'ve got to listen. You got to find a way to listen.","Every writer has only one story to tell, and he has to find a way of telling it until the meaning becomes clearer and clearer, until the story becomes at once more narrow and larger, more and more precise, more and more reverberating.","For, you see, he had found his center, his own center, inside him: and it showed. He wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s nigger. And that\u2019s a crime, in this fucking free country. You\u2019re suppose to be somebody\u2019s nigger. And if you\u2019re nobody\u2019s nigger, you\u2019re a bad nigger: and that\u2019s what the cops decided when Fonny moved downtown.","So what can we really do for each other except--just love each other and be each other\'s witness? And haven\'t we got the right to hope--for more? So that we can really stretch into whoever we really are?","People are full of surprise, even for themselves, if they have been stirred enough.","In a way, I owe the invitation to the incredible, abysmal, and really cowardly obtuseness of white liberals. Whether in private debate or in public, any attempt I made to explain how the Black Muslim movement came about, and how it has achieved such force, was met with a blankness that revealed the little connection that the liberals\' attitudes have with their perceptions or their lives, or even their knowledge\u2014revealed, in fact, that they could deal with the Negro as a symbol or a victim but had no sense of him as a man.","In the beginning\u2014and neither can this be overstated\u2014a Negro just cannot believe that white people are treating him as they do; he does not know what he has done to merit it. And when he realizes that the treatment accorded him has nothing to do with anything he has done, that the attempt of white people to destroy him\u2014for that is what it is\u2014is utterly gratuitous, it is not hard for him to think of white people as devils.","A mob cannot afford to doubt: that the Jews killed Christ or that niggers want to rape their sisters or that anyone who fails to make it in the land of the free and the home of the brave deserves to be wretched. But these ideas do not come from the mob. They come from the state, which creates and manipulates the mob. The idea of a black persons as property, for example, does not come from the mob. It is not a spontaneous idea. It does not come from the people, who knew better, who thought nothing of intermarriage until they were penalized for it: this idea comes from the architects of the American State. These architects decided that the concept of Property was more important\u2014more real\u2014than the possibilities of the human being.","I scarcely know how to describe that room. It became, in a way, every room I had ever been in and every room I find myself in hereafter will remind me of Giovanni\u2019s room.","If we know, then we must fight for your life as though it were our own-which it is-and render impassable with our bodies the corridors to the gas chamber. For if they come for you in the morning, they will be coming for us that night.","The way to be really despicable is to be contemptuous of other people\'s pain.","One must say Yes to life and embrace it wherever it is found\u2014and it is found in terrible places; nevertheless, there it is.","There is never a time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment, the time is always now.","The rebirth of the soul is perpetual; only rebirth every hour could stay the hand of Satan.","Terrifying, that the loss of intimacy with one person results in the freezing over of the world, and the loss of oneself! And terrifying that the terms of love are so rigorous, its checks and liberties so tightly bound together\u2026 Their relationship depended on her restraint\u2026 The premise of their affair, or the basis of their comedy, was that they were two independent people, who needed each other for a time, who would always be friends, but who, probably, would not always be lovers. Such a premise forbids the intrusion of the future, or too vivid an exhibition of need.","Much has been written of love turning to hatred, of the heart growing cold with the death of love. It is a remarkable process. It is far more terrible than anything I have ever read about it, more terrible than anything I will ever be able to say.","To accept one\'s past - one\'s history - is not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it.","Yet it is only when one is able, without bitterness or self-pity, to surrender a dream one has long cherished, or a privilege one has long possessed, that one is set free\u2026that one has set oneself free, for higher dreams, for greater privileges. James Baldwin","I was just as black as I had been the day that I was born. Therefore, when I faced a congregation, it began to take all the strength I had not to stammer, not to curse, not to tell them to throw away their Bibles and get off their knees and go home and organize, for example, a rent strike. When I watched all the children, their copper, brown, and beige faces staring up at me as I taught Sunday school, I felt that I was committing a crime in talking about the gentle Jesus, in telling them to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life. Were only Negroes to gain this crown? Was Heaven, then, to be merely another ghetto?","Nobody can stay in the garden of Eden,\\" Jacques said. And then: \\"I wonder why.\\"...Everyone, after all, goes the same dark road--and the road has a trick of being most dark, most treacherous, when it seems most bright--and it\'s true that nobody stays in the garden of Eden. ... Perhaps everybody has a garden of Eden, I don\'t know; but they have scarcely seen their garden before they see the flaming sword. Then, perhaps, life only offers the choice of remembering the garden or forgetting it. Either, or: it takes strength to remember, it takes another type of strength to forget, it takes a hero to do both. People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of the pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget. Heroes are rare.","The person who distrusts himself has no touchstone for reality\u2014for this touchstone can be only oneself.","You\'re getting to be a big boy,\' I said desperately, \'it\'s time you started thinking about your future.\'\'I\'m thinking about my future,\' said Sonny, grimly. \'I think about it all the time.","The young think that failure is the Siberian end of the line, banishment from all the living, and tend to do what I then did--which was to hide.","His touch could never fail to make me feel desire; yet his hot, sweet breath also made me want to vomit.","Time could not be bought. The only coin time accepted was life.","Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor; and if one is a member of a captive population, economically speaking, one\'s feet have simply been placed on the treadmill forever.","[I am] someone who represents a very complex country which insists on being simple-minded. And simplicity, it occurs to me, it has occurred to me more than once, in my somewhat stormy life, simplicity is taken to be a great American virtue, along with sincerity. And the result of this is, if you are simple-minded enough, you can become\u2014I didn\u2019t want to go that far [laughs]. And as long as you\u2019re sincere in what you say, you haven\u2019t got to know what you\u2019re talking about. These are the American virtues\u2014two of them anyway. One of the results of this is that immaturity is taken to be a virtue too.","No matter how it seems now, I must confess: I loved him. I do not think that I will ever love anyone like that again. And this might be a great relief if I did not also know that, when the knife has fallen, Giovanni, if he feels anything will feel relief.","I loved her as much as ever and I still did not know how much that was.","It was better not to judge the man who had gone down under an impossible burden. It was better to remember: Thou knowest this man\'s fall, but thou knowest not his wrassling.","hatred, which could destroy so much, never failed to destroy the one who hated, and this is an immutable law...i imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense that once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.","You don\u2019t know, and there\u2019s no way in the world for you to find out, what it\u2019s like to be a black girl in this world, and the way white men, and black men, too, baby, treat you.","You can\'t see yourself all over. But I can. Part of you is honey, part of you is copper, some of you is gold--","She was in a terrible state, for she found that she could neither take her eyes off him nor look at him.","One would never defeat one\'s circumstances by working and saving one\'s pennies; one would never, by working, acquire that many pennies, and, besides, the social treatment accorded even the most successful Negroes proved that one needed, in order to be free, something more than a bank account. One needed a handle, a lever, a means of inspiring fear. It was absolutely clear that the police would whip you and take you in as long as they could get away with it, and that everyone else\u2014housewives, taxi-drivers, elevator boys, dishwashers, bartenders, lawyers, judges, doctors, and grocers\u2014would never, by the operation of any generous human feeling, cease to use you as an outlet for his frustrations and hostilities.","For nothing is fixed, forever and forever and forever, it is not fixed; the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock. Generations do not cease to be born, and we are responsible to them because we are the only witnesses they have.","Love him,\' said Jacques, with vehemence, \'love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters?","And I was alone, had been for a while, and might be for a while, but it no longer frightened me the way it had. I was discovering something terrifyingly simple: there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. I was discovering this in the way, I suppose, that everybody does, but having tried, endlessly, to do something about it. You attach yourself to someone, or you allow someone to attach themselves to you. This person is not for you, and you, really, are not for that person--and that\'s it, son. But you try, you both try. The only result of all your trying is to make absolutely real the unconquerable distance between you: to dramatize, in a million ways, the absolutely unalterable truth of this distance. Side by side, and hand in hand, your sunsets, nevertheless are not occurring in the same universe. It is not merely that the rain falls differently on each of you, for that can be a wonder and a joy: it is that what is rain for the one is not rain for the other. Your elements will not mix, unless one agrees that the elements be pulverized--and the result of that is worse than being alone. The result of that is to become one of the living dead. The most dreadful people I have ever known are those who have been \\"saved,\\" as they claim, by Christ--they could not possibly be more deluded--those for whom the heavenly telephone is endlessly ringing, always with disastrous messages for everybody else. Or those people who have been cured by their psychiatrists, a cure which has rendered them a little less exciting than oatmeal. I prefer sinners and madmen, who can learn, who can change, who can teach--or people like myself, if I may say so, who are not afraid to eat a lobster alone as they take on their shoulders the monumental weight of thirty years.","I am very much concerned that American Negroes achieve their freedom here in the United States. But I am also concerned for their dignity, for the health of their souls, and must oppose any attempt that Negroes may make to do to others what has been done to them.","Men - not just babies like you, but old men, too - they always need to have a woman tell them the truth. Les hommes, ils sont impossibles.","The only thing white people have that black people need, or should want, is power\u2014and no one holds power forever. White people cannot, in the generality, be taken as models of how to live.","Yes, he had heard it all his life, but it was only now that his ears were opened to this sound that came from darkness, that could only come from darkness, that yet bore such sure witness to the glory of the light. And now in his moaning, and so far from any help, he heard it in himself--it rose from his bleeding, his cracked-open heart. It was a sound of rage and weeping which filled the grave, rage and weeping from time set free, but bound now in eternity; rage that had no language, weeping with no voice--which yet spoke now, to John\'s startled soul, of boundless melancholy, of the bitterest patience, and the longest night; of the deepest water, the strongest chains, the most cruel lash; of humility most wretched, the dungeon most absolute, of love\'s bed defiled, and birth dishonored, and most bloody, unspeakable, sudden death. Yes, the darkness hummed with murder: the body in the water, the body in the fire, the body on the tree. John looked down the line of these armies of darkness, army upon army, and his soul whispered: Who are these? Who are they? And wondered: Where shall I go?","It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death--ought to decide, indeed, to earn one\'s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible to life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return. One must negotiate this passage as nobly as possible....It is the responsibility of free men to trust and to celebrate what is constant--birth, struggle, and death are constant, and so is love, though we may not always think so--and to apprehend the nature of change, to be able and willing to change. I speak of change not on the surface but in the depths--change in the sense of renewal. But renewal becomes impossible if one supposes things to be constant that are not--safety, for example, or money, or power. One clings then to chimeras, by which one can only be betrayed, and the entire hope--the entire possibility of freedom disappears.","People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.","John\u2019s heart was hardened against the Lord. His father was God\u2019s minister, the ambassador of the King of Heaven, and John could not bow before the throne of grace without first kneeling to his father.","In any event, the sloppy and fatuous nature of American good will can never be relied upon to deal with hard problems. These have been dealt with, when they have been dealt with at all, out of necessity\u2014and in political terms, anyway, necessity means concessions made in order to stay on top.","The question is really a kind of apathy and ignorance, which is the price we pay for segregation. That\u2019s what segregation means. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening on the other side of the wall, because you don\u2019t want to know.","In the context of the Negro problem neither whites nor blacks, for excellent reasons of their own, have the faintest desire to look back; but I think that the past is all that makes the present coherent, and further, that the past will remain horrible for exactly as long as we refuse to assess it honestly.","But I know about suffering; if that helps. I know that it ends. I ain\u2019t going to tell you no lies, like it always ends for the better. Sometimes it ends for the worse. You can suffer so bad that you can be driven to a place where you can\u2019t ever suffer again: and that\u2019s worse.","There appears to be a vast amount of confusion on this point, but I do not know many Negroes who are eager to be \\"accepted\\" by white people, still less to be loved by them; they, the blacks, simply don\'t wish to be beaten over the head by the whites every instant of our brief passage on this planet.","Time catches up with kingdoms and crushes them, gets its teeth into doctrines and rends them; time reveals the foundations on which any kingdom rests, and eats at those foundations, and it destroys doctrines by proving them to be untrue.","And he knew again that she was not saying everything she meant; in a kind of secret language she was telling him today something that he must remember and understand tomorrow. He watched her face, his heart swollen with love for her and with an anguish, not yet his own, that he did not understand and that frightened him.","Yet one must also recognize that morality is based on ideas and that all ideas are dangerous\u2014dangerous because ideas can only lead to action and where the action leads no man can say.","Try to imagine how you would feel if you woke up one morning to find the sun shining and all the stars aflame. You would be frightened because it is out of the order of nature. Any upheaval in the universe is terrifying because it so profoundly attacks one\'s sense of one\'s own reality. Well, the black man has functioned in the white man\'s world as a fixed star, as an immovable pillar: and as he moves out of his place, heaven and earth are shaken to their foundation.","Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death\u2014ought to decide, indeed, to earn one\'s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible to life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return. One must negotiate this passage as nobly as possible, for the sake of those who are coming after us.","Oedipus did not remember the thongs that bound his feet; nevertheless the marks they left testified to that doom toward which his feet were leading him. The man does not remember the hand that struck him, the darkness that frightened him, as a child; nevertheless, the hand and the darkness remain with him, indivisible from himself forever, part of the passion that drives him wherever he thinks to take flight.","She, who had descended with such joy and pain, had begun her upward climb\u2014upward, with her baby, on the steep, steep side of the mountain.","You don\'t know how much I needed to hear from you. I wanted to write you many a time but I dug how much I must have hurt you and so I didn\'t write. But now I feel like a man who\'s been trying to climb up out of some deep, really deep and funky hole and just saw the sun up there, outside. I got to get outside.","We cannot escape our origins, however hard we try, those origins which contain the key -could we but find it- to all we later become","But he had the tendency of all wildly disorganised people to suppose that the lives of others were tamer and less sensual and more cerebral than his own.","We stared at each other across a narrow space that was full of danger, that almost seemed to roar, like flame.\u2018Come,\u2019 he said.","I saw myself, sharply, as a wanderer, an adventurer, rocking through the world, unanchored.[...]The wind of my life was blowing me away.[...]I take the blue envelope...and tear it slowly into many pieces, watching them dance in the wind, watching the wind carry them away. Yet as I turn and begin walking toward the waiting people, the wind blows some of them back on me.","We live in a nation of pigs and murderers.","Elisha,\' he said, \'no matter what happens to me, where I go, what folks say about me, no matter what anybody says, you remember - please remember - I was saved. I was there.","A child cannot be taught by anyone who despises him, and a child cannot afford to be fooled. A child cannot be taught by anyone whose demand, essentially, is that the child repudiate his experience, and all that gives him sustenance.","You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason. The limits of your ambition were, thus, expected to be set forever. You were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity, and in as many ways as possible, that you were a worthless human being. You are not expected to aspire to excellence: you were expected to make peace with mediocrity.","Loving anybody and being loved by anybody is a tremendous danger, a tremendous responsibility. Loving of children, raising of children. The terrors homosexuals go through in this society would not be so great if the society itself did not go through so many terrors which it doesn\u2019t want to admit. The discovery of one\u2019s sexual preference doesn\u2019t have to be a trauma. It\u2019s a trauma because it\u2019s such a traumatized society.","This innocent country set you down in a ghetto in which, in fact, it intended that you should perish.","And the darkness of John\'s sin was like the darkness of the church on Saturday evenings[...] It was like his thoughts as he moved about the tabernacle in which his life had been spent; the tabernacle that he hated, yet loved and feared[...] The darkness of his sin was in the hardheartedness with which he resisted God\'s power; in the scorn that was often his while he listened to the crying, breaking voices, and watched the black skin glisten while they lifted up their arms and fell on their faces before the Lord. For he had made his decision. He would not be like his father, or his father\'s fathers. He would have another life.","It began to seem that one would have to hold in the mind forever two ideas which seemed to be in opposition. The first idea was acceptance, the acceptance, totally without rancor, of life as it is, and men as they are: in the light of this idea, it goes without saying that injustice is a commonplace. But this did not mean that one could be complacent, for the second idea was of equal power: that one must never, in one own\'s life, accept these injustices as commonplace but must fight them with all one\'s strength...","The price of the liberation of the white people is the liberation of the blacks\u2014the total liberation, in the cities, in the towns, before the law, and in the mind.","I kissed her salty tears and murmured, murmured I don\u2019t know what. I felt her body straining, straining to meet mine and I felt my own contracting and drawing away and I knew that I had begun the long fall down.","The menfolk, they die, all right. And it\'s us women who walk around, like the Bible says, and mourn. The menfolk, they die, and it\'s over for them, but we women, we have to keep on living and try to forget what they done to us.","Nothing tamed or broke her, nothing touched her, neither kindness, nor scorn, nor hatred, nor love. She had never thought of prayer. It was unimaginable that she would ever bend her knees and come crawling along a dusty floor to anybody\u2019s altar, weeping for forgiveness. Perhaps her sin was so extreme that it could not be forgiven; perhaps her pride was so great that she did not need forgiveness. She had fallen from that high estate which God had intended for men and women, and she made her fall glorious because it was so complete.","Maybe everything bad that happens to you makes you weaker,\\" said Giovanni, as though he had not heard me, \\"and so you can stand less and less.","Whereas Jesus and his disciples were distrusted by the state largely because they respected the poor and shared everything, the fundamentalists of the present hour would appear not to know that the poor exist.","I think people ought to do what they want to do, what else are they alive for?","Some escaped the trap, most didn\'t. Those who got out always left something of themselves behind, as some animals amputate a leg and leave it in the trap. It might be said, perhaps, that I had escaped, after all, I was a school teacher; or that Sonny had, he hadn\'t lived in Harlem for years. Yet, as the cab moved uptown through streets which seemed, with a rush, to darken with dark people, and as I covertly studied Sonny\'s face, it came to me that what we both were seeking through our separate cab windows was that part of ourselves which had been left behind. It\'s always at the hour of trouble and confrontation that the missing member aches.","Yves did not like showers, he preferred long, scalding baths, with newspapers, cigarettes, and whiskey on a chair next to the bathtub, and with Eric nearby to talk to, to shampoo his hair, and to scrub his back.","I had to get out of there for my face showed too much, the war in my body was dragging me down. My feet refused to carry me over to him again. The wind of my life was blowing me away.","Nothing is more unbearable, once has it, than freedom.","Joyce is right about history being a nightmare\u2014but it may be the nightmare from which no one can awaken. People are trapped in history and history is trapped in them.","A big, sandy-haired man held his daughter on his shoulders, showing her the Statue of Liberty. I would never know what this statue meant to others, she had always been an ugly joke for me. And the American flag was flying from the top of the ship, above my head. I had seen the French flag drive the French into the most unspeakable frenzies, I had seen the flag which was nominally mine used to dignify the vilest purposes: now I would never, as long as I lived, know what other saw when they saw a flag.","I remember, for example, when the ex-Attorney General, Mr. Robert Kennedy, said that it was conceivable that in forty years in America we might have a Negro president. And that sounded like a very emancipated statement, I suppose, to white people. They were not in Harlem when this statement was first heard. They did not hear (and possibly will never hear) the laughter and the bitterness and the scorn with which this statement was greeted. From the point of view of the man in the Harlem barbershop, Bobby Kennedy only got here yesterday and now he\'s already on his way to the presidency. We\'ve been here for four hundred years and now he tells us that maybe in forty years, if you\'re good, we may let you become president.","We had bought a kilo of cherries and we were eating them as we walked along. We were both insufferably childish and high-spirited that afternoon and th spectacle we presented, two grown men, jostling each other on the wide sidewalk, and aiming the cherry-pips, as though they were spitballs, into each other\'s facesm must have been outrageous. And I realized that such childishness was fantastic at my age and the happiness out of which it sprang yet more so; for that moment I really loved Giovanni, who had never seemed more beautiful than he was that afternoon. And, watching his face, I realized that it meant much to me that I could make his face so bright. I saw that I might be willing to give a great deal not to lose that power. And I felt myself flow toward him, as a river rushes when the ice breaks up.","He grins again, and everything inside me moves. Oh, love. Love.","It is not really a \u201cNegro revolution that is upsetting the country. What is upsetting the country is a sense of its own identity. If, for example, one managed to change the curriculum in all the schools so that Negroes learned more about themselves and their real contributions to this culture, you would be liberating not only Negroes, you\u2019d be liberating white people who know nothing about their own history. And the reason is that if you are compelled to lie about one aspect of anybody\u2019s history, you must lie about it all. If you have to lie about my real role here, if you have to pretend that I hoed all that cotton just because I loved you, then you have done something to yourself. You are mad.\u201d","A man is not a man until he\u2019s able and willing to accept his own vision of the world, no matter how radically this vision departs from that of others.","But what was the point, the purpose, of my salvation if it did not permit me to behave with love toward others, no matter how they behaved toward me? What others did was their responsibility, for which they would answer when the judgment trumpet sounded.","It is your responsibility to change the society if you think yourself as an educated person","Looking at his face, it sometimes came to her that all women had been cursed from the cradle; all, in one fashion or another, being given the same cruel destiny, born to suffer the weight of men. Frank claimed that she got it all wrong side up: it was men who suffered because they had to put up with the ways of women\u2014and this from the time that they were born until the day they died.","I have been carried into precinct basements often enough, and I have seen and heard and endured the secrets of desperate white men and women, which they knew were safe with me, because even if I should speak, no one would believe me. And they would not believe me precisely because they would know that what I said was true.","No curtain under heaven is heavier than that curtain of guilt and lies behind which white Americans hide.","For here you were, Big James, named for me\u2014you were a big baby, I was not\u2014here you were, to be loved. To be loved, baby, hard, at once, and forever, to strengthen you against the loveless world.","Beneath the face of anyone you ever loved for true - anyone you love, you will always love, love is not at the mercy of time and it does not recognize death, they are strangers to each other - beneath the face of the beloved, however ancient, ruined, and scarred, is the face of the baby your love once was, and will always be, for you. Love serves, then, if memory doesn\'t, and passion, apart from its tense relation to agony, labors beneath the shadow of death. Passion is terrifying, it can rock you, change you, bring your head under, as when a wind rises from the bottom of the sea, and you\'re out there in the craft of your mortality, alone.","One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself - that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving","Ultimately, the artist and the revolutionary function as they function, and pay whatever dues they must pay behind it because they are both possessed by a vision, and they do not so much follow this vision as find themselves driven by it. Otherwise, they could never endure, much less embrace, the lives they are compelled to lead.","People make you pay for the way you look, which is also the way you think you look, and what time writes is a record of that collision.","but the Atlantic Ocean is deep and wide and money doesn\'t hurry from the other side.","To act is to be committed, and to be committed is to be in danger. In this case, the danger, in the minds of most white Americans, is the loss of their identity.","he was one of those poets who escaped the terrors of writing by writing all the time.","I may be drunk by morning but that will not do any good. I shall take the train to Paris anyway. The train will be the same, the people, struggling for comfort and, even, dignity on the straight-backed, wooden, third-class seats will be the same, and I will be the same. We will ride through the same changing countryside northward, leaving behind the olive trees and the sea and all of the glory of the stormy southern sky, into the mist and rain of Paris. Someone will offer to share a sandwich with me, someone will offer me a sip of wine, someone will ask me for a match. People will be roaming the corridors outside, looking out of windows, looking in at us. At each stop, recruits in their baggy brown uniforms and colored hats will open the compartment door to ask Complet? We will all nod Yes, like conspirators, smiling faintly at each other as they continue through the train. Two or three of them will end up before our compartment door, shouting at each other in their heavy, ribald voices, smoking their dreadful army cigarettes. There will be a girl sitting opposite me who will wonder why I have not been flirting with her, who will be set on edge by the presence of the recruits. It will all be the same, only I will be stiller.","And then: \'Here comes your baby. Sois sage. Sois chic.\' He moved slightly away and began talking to the boy next to him. And here my baby came indeed, through all that sunlight, his face flushed and his hair flying, his eyes, unbelievably, like morning stars.","On days like this,\\" Cass said, suddenly, \\"I remember what it was like--I think I remember--to be young, very young.\\" She looked up at him. \\"When everything, touching and tasting--everything--was so new, and even suffering was wonderful because it was so complete.","We\u2019re getting old, he thought, and it damn sure didn\u2019t take long.","The poor are always crossing the Sahara. And the lawyers and bondsmen and all that crowd circle around the poor, exactly like vultures. Of course, they\u2019re not any richer than the poor, really, that\u2019s why they\u2019ve turned into vultures, scavengers, indecent garbage men, and I\u2019m talking about the black cats, too, who, in so many ways, are worse.","But it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be innocent. It is the innocence which constitutes the crime.","I don\'t believe in this nonsense about time. Time is just common, it\'s like water for a fish. Everybody\'s in this water, nobody gets out of it, or if he does the same thing happens to him that happens to the fish, he dies. And you know what happens in this water, time? The big fish eat the little fish. That\'s all. The big fish eat the little fish and the ocean doesn\'t care.","...but no one was interested in the facts. They preferred the invention because this invention expressed and corroborated their hates and fears so perfectly.","The American idea of sexuality appears to be rooted in the American idea of masculinity. Idea may not be the precise word, for the idea of one\u2019s sexuality can only with great violence be divorced or distanced from the idea of the self. Yet something resembling this rupture has certainly occurred (and is occurring) in American life, and violence has been the American daily bread since we have heard of America. This violence, furthermore, is not merely literal and actual but appears to be admired and lusted after, and the key to the American imagination.All countries or groups make of their trials a legend or, as in the case of Europe, a dubious romance called \u2018history.\u2019 But no other country has ever made so successful and glamorous a romance out of genocide and slavery; therefore, perhaps, the word I am searching for is not idea, but ideal.The American IDEAL, then, of sexuality appears to be rooted in the American IDEAL of masculinity. This ideal has created cowboys and Indians, good guys and bad guys, punks and studs, tough guys and softies, butch and f****t, black and white. It is an ideal so paralytically infantile that is is virtually forbidden\u2014as an unpatriotic act\u2014that the American boy evolve into the complexity of manhood.","Now I think there is a very good reason why the Negro in this country has been treated for such a long time in such a cruel way, and some of the reasons are economic and some of them are political. We have discussed these reasons without ever coming to any kind of resolution for a very long time. Some of them are social, and these reasons are somewhat more important because they have to do with our social panic, with our fear of losing status. This really amounts sometimes to a kind of social paranoia. One cannot afford to lose status on this peculiar ladder, for the prevailing notion of American life seems to involve a kind of rung-by-rung ascension to some hideously desirable state. If this is one\u2019s concept of life, obviously one cannot afford to slip back one rung. When one slips, one slips back not a rung but back into chaos and no longer knows who he is. And this reason, this fear, suggests to me one of the real reasons for the status of the Negro in this country.","But in order to deal with the untapped and dormant force of the previously subjugated, in order to survive as a human, moving, moral weight in the world, America and all the Western nations will be forced to re\xebxamine themselves and release themselves from many things that are now taken to be sacred, and to discard nearly all the assumptions that have been used to justify their lives and their anguish and their crimes so long.","I smiled and I really felt at that moment that Judas and the Savior had met in me. [...] And yet even this was not as real as my despairing sense that nothing was real for me again\u2014unless, indeed, this sensation of falling was reality.","It is not a racial problem. It is a problem of whether or not you\'re willing to look at your life and be responsible for it, and then begin to change it.","To be liberated from the stigma of blackness by embracing it is to cease, forever, one\'s interior argument and collaboration with the authors of one\'s degradation. It abruptly reduces the white enemy to a contest merely physical, which he can win only physically.","The sons of the masters were roaming the world, looking for arms to hold them. And the arms that might have held them--could not forgive.","This is the only real concern of the artist, to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art.","He and his boys up there were keeping it new, at the risk of ruin, destruction, madness, and death, in order to find new ways to make us listen. For, while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard. There isn\'t any other tale to tell, it\'s the only light we\'ve got in all this darkness.","Well, the black man has functioned in the white man\'s world as a fixed star, as an immovable pillar: and as he moves out of his place, heaven and earth are shaken to their foundations. You, don\'t be afraid. I said that it was intended that you should perish in the ghetto, perish by never being allowed to go behind the white man\'s definitions, by never being allowed to spell your proper name. You have, and many of us have, defeated this intention; and, by a terrible law, a terrible paradox, those innocents who believed that your imprisonment made them safe are losing their grasp of reality. But these men are your brothers - your lost, younger brothers. And if the word integration means anything, this is what it means: that we, with love, shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it. For this is your home, my friend, do not be driven from it; great men have done great things here, and will again, and we can make America what America must become. It will be hard, James, but you come from sturdy, peasant stock, men who picked cotton and damned rivers and built railroads, and, in the teeth of the most terrifying odds, achieved an unassailable and monumental dignity. You come from a long line of great poets, some of the greatest poets since Homer. One of them said, The very time I thought I was lost, My dungeon shook and my chains fell off.","The real troubles with living is that living is so banal. Everyone, after all, goes the same dark road\u2014and the road has a trick of being the most dark, most treacherous, when it seems most bright\u2014and it\u2019s true that nobody stays in the garden of Eden.","He is not here for anything he has done. He has always known that, but now he knows it with a difference. At meals, in the showers, up and down the stairs, in the evening, just before everyone is locked in again, he looks at the others, he listens: what have they done? Not much. To do much is to have the power to place these people where they are, and keep them where they are. These captive men are the hidden price for a hidden lie: the righteous must be able to locate the damned. To do much is to have the power and the necessity to dictate to the damned.","Fonny had found something that he could do, that he wanted to do, and this saved him from the death that was waiting to overtake the children of our age. Though the death took many forms, though people died early in many different ways, the death itself was very simple and the cause was simple, too: as simple as a plague: the kids had been told that they weren\'t worth shit and everything they saw around them proved it. They struggled, they struggled, but they fell, like flies, and they congregated on the garbage heaps of their lives, like flies. And perhaps I clung to Fonny, perhaps Fonny saved me because he was just about the only boy I knew who wasn\'t fooling around with the needles or drinking cheap wine or mugging people or holding up stores - and he never got his hair conked: it just stayed nappy. He started working as a short-order cook in a barbecue joint, so he could eat, and he found a basement where he could work on his wood and he was at our house more often than he was at his own house.","An artist is a sort of emotional or spiritual historian. His role is to make you realize the doom and glory of knowing who you are and what you are. He has to tell, because nobody else in the world can tell, what it is like to be alive. All I\u2019ve ever wanted to do is tell that, I\u2019m not trying to solve anybody\u2019s problems, not even my own. I\u2019m just trying to outline what the problems are.I want to be stretched, shook up, to overreach myself, and to make you feel that way too.","And these nights were being acted out under a foreign sky, with no one to watch, no penalties attached\u2014it was this last fact which was our undoing for nothing is more unbearable, once one has it, than freedom. I suppose this was why I asked her to marry me: to give myself something to be moored to. Perhaps this was why, in Spain, she decided that she wanted to marry me. But people can\u2019t, unhappily, invent their mooring posts, their lovers and their friends, anymore than they can invent their parents. Life gives these and also takes them away and the great difficulty is to say Yes to life.","We spend vast amounts of our time an emotional energy in learning how not to be natural and in eluding the trap of our own nature and it therefore becomes very difficult to know exactly what is meant when we speak of the unnatural. It is not possible to have it both ways, to use nature at one time as the final arbiter of human conduct and at another to oppose her as angrily as we do.","In any case, white people, who had robbed black people of their liberty and who profited by this theft every hour that they lived, had no moral ground on which to stand. They had the judges, the juries, the shotguns, the law\u2014in a word, power. But it was a criminal power, to be feared but not respected, and to be outwitted in any way whatever. And those virtues preached but not practiced by the white world were merely another means of holding Negroes in subjection.","Books taught me that things that tormented me the most were the very things that connected me to everyone who is alive and who had ever been alive.","Well, I may or may not be bitter, but if I were I would have good reasons for it: chief among them that American blindness, or cowardice, which allows us to pretend that life presents no reasons for being bitter.","Folks can change their ways much as they want to. But I don\u2019t care how many times you change your ways, what\u2019s in you is in you, and it\u2019s got to come out.","You face reality, not the lights. The lights go off as quickly as they come on.","she was disquietingly fluid\u2014fluid without, however, being able to flow. I felt a hardness and a constriction in her, a grave mistrust, created already by too many men like me ever to be conquered now.","I don\'t believe there\'s a white man in this country, baby, who can get his dick hard, without he hear some nigger moan.","This was not the man they had known, but they had scarcely expected to be confronted with him; this was, in a sense deeper than questions of fact, the man they had not known, and the man they had not known may have been the real one. The real man, whoever he had been, had suffered and now he was dead: this was all that was sure and all that mattered now.","Tell me,\' he said, \'what is this thing about time? Why is it better to be late than early? People are always saying, we must wait. What are they waiting for?","You know, and I know, that the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too soon. We cannot be free until they are free.","It is entirely unacceptable that I should have no voice in the political affairs of my own country, for I am not a ward of America; I am one of the first Americans to arrive on these shores.","There are few things more dreadful than dealing with a man who know that he is going under in his own eyes, and in the eyes of others. Nothing can help that man.","It comes as a great shock to see Gary Cooper killing off the Indians and, although you are rooting for Gary Cooper, that the Indians is you","We had our arms round each other. It was like holding in my hand some rare, exhausted, nearly doomed bird which I had miraculously happened to find.","In this endeavor to wed the vision of the Old World with that of the New, it is the writer, not the statesman, who is our strongest arm. Though we do not wholly believe it yet, the interior life is a real life, and the intangible dreams of people have a tangible effect on the world.","It ain\'t only the bad ones, nor yet the dumb ones that gets sucked under.","He wanted me to come home--to come home, as he said, and settle down, and whenever he said that I thought of the sediment at the bottom of a stagnant pond.","it is the responsibility of free men to trust and celebrate what is constant\u2014birth, struggle, and death are constant, and so is love, though we may not always think so\u2014and to apprehend the nature of change, to be able and willing to change.","The people who think of themselves as White have the choice of becoming human or irrelevant.Or--as they are, indeed, already, in all but actual fact: obsolete. For, if trouble don\'t last always, as the Preacher tells us, neither does Power, and it is on the fact or the hope or the myth of Power that that identity which calls itself White has always seemed to depend.","It goes without saying, I believe, that if we understood ourselves better, we would damage ourselves less.","If we understood ourselves better we would damage ourselves less.","Strangers\' faces hold no secrets because the imagination does not invest them with any. But the face of a lover is an unknown precisely because it is invested with so much of oneself. It is a mystery, containing, like all mysteries, the possibility of torment.","One writes out of one thing only\u2014one\u2019s own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give.","But the conquest of the physical world is not man\u2019s only duty. He is also enjoined to conquer the great wilderness of himself. The precise role of the artist, then, is to illuminate that darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest, so that we will not, in all our doing, lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.","Everything was as it had been between us, and at the same time everything was different.","White man, hear me! History, as nearly no one seems to know, is not merely something to be read. And it does not refer, merely, or even principally, to the past. On the contrary, the great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do.","I was thinking, no doubt, of our nights in bed, of the peculiar innocence and confidence, which will never come again, which had made those nights so delightful, so unrelated to past, present, or anything to come, so unrelated, finally, to my life since it was not necessary for me to take any but the most mechanical responsibility for them. And these nights were being acted out under a foreign sky, with no one to watch, no penalties attached\u2014it was this last fact which was our undoing, for nothing is more unbearable, once one has it, than freedom.","There are so many ways of being despicable it quite makes one\u2019s head spin. But the way to be really despicable is to be contemptuous of other people\u2019s pain. You ought to have some apprehension that the man you see before you was once even younger than you are now and arrived at his present wretchedness by imperceptible degrees.",". . . and what in the world was I by now but an aging, lonely, sexually dubious, politically outrageous, unspeakably erratic freak?","To encounter oneself is to encounter the other: and this is love. If I know that my soul trembles, I know that yours does, too: and if I can respect this, both of us can live. Neither of us, truly, can live without the other: a statement which would not sound so banal if one were not so endlessly compelled to repeat it, and act on that belief.","The first love disappears, but never goes. That ache becomes reconciliation.","Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know you love me. You believe we going to make it?","That was how I met her, in a bar in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\xe9s, she was drinking and watching, and that was why I liked her, I thought she would be fun to have fun with.","From my own point of view, the fact of the Third Reich alone makes obsolete forever any question of Christian superiority, except in technological terms. White people were, and are, astounded by the holocaust in Germany. They did not know that they could act that way. But I very much doubt whether black people were astounded\u2014at least, in the same way.","Life, it is true, is a process of decisions and alternatives, the conscious awareness and acceptance of limitations. Experience, nevertheless, to say nothing of history, seems clearly to indicate that it is not possible to banish or to falsify any human need without ourselves undergoing falsification and loss.","He wanted to go home and lock his door and sleep. He was tired of the troubles of real people. He wanted to get back to the people he was inventing, whose troubles he could bear.","I don\'t give a damn if there\'s any hope for them or not. But I know that I am not about to be bugged by any more white jokers who still can\'t figure out whether I\'m human or not. If they don\'t know, baby, sad on them, and I hope they drop dead slowly, in great pain.","To be sensual, I think, is to respect and rejoice in the force of life, of life itself, and to be present in all that one does, from the effort of loving to the breaking of bread. It will be a great day for America, incidentally, when we begin to eat bread again, instead of the blasphemous and tasteless foam rubber that we have substituted for it. And I am not being frivolous now, either. Something very sinister happens to the people of a country when they begin to distrust their own reactions as deeply as they do here, and become as joyless as they have become.","She marched into the street, found a liquor store and bought a bottle; and the weight of the bottle in her straw handbag somehow made everything real; as the purchase of a railroad ticket proves the imminence of a journey.","The questions which one asks oneself begin, at last, to illuminate the world, and become one\'s key to the experience of others. One can only face in others what one can face in oneself. On this confrontation depends the measure of our wisdom and compassion. This energy is all that one finds in the rubble of vanished civilizations, and the only hope for ours.","He stood for a moment on the melting snow, distracted, and then began to run down the hill, feeling himself fly as the descent became more rapid, and thinking: \u201cI can climb back up. If it\u2019s wrong, I can always climb back up.","There they stood, in twos and threes and fours, in their Cub Scout uniforms and with their Cub Scout faces, totally unprepared, as is the way with American he-men, for anything that could not be settled with a club or a fist or a gun.","Europeans never had the remotest intention of raising Africans to the Western level, of sharing with them the instruments of physical, political or economic power. It was precisely their intention, their necessity, to keep the people they ruled in a state of cultural anarchy, that is, simply in a barbaric state. \u201cThe famous inferiority complex one is pleased to observe as a characteristic of the colonized is no accident but something very definitely desired and deliberately inculcated by the colonizer.","They have never put it into words, they cannot; but each absence is a threat. They never felt this way in New York - they moved all over New York. Here each is afraid that one of the others will get into some terrible trouble before he is seen again, and before anyone can help him. It is the spirit of the people, the eyes which endlessly watch them, eyes which never meet their eyes. Something like lust, something like hatred, seems to hover in the air along the country roads, shifting like mist or steam, but always there, gripping the city streets like fog, making every corner a dangerous corner. They spend more of themselves, each day, than they can possibly afford, they are living beyond their means; they drop into bed each evening, exhausted, into an exhausting sleep. And no one can help them. The people who live here know how to do it - so it seems, anyway - but they cannot teach the secret. The secret can be learned only by watching, by emulating the models, by dangerous trial and possibly mortal error.","You read something which you thought only happened to you, and you discover that it happened 100 years ago to Dostoyevsky. This is a very great liberation for the suffering, struggling person, who always thinks that he is alone. This is why art is important. Art would not be important if life were not important, and life is important.","The colors on the river faded, the rain began, and the river began to rise. It was apparent that the sun would soon give up the tremendous struggle it cost her to get to Paris for a few hours every day.","I know what I\'m asking is impossible. But in our time, as in every time, the impossible is the least that one can demand-and one is, after all, emboldened by the spectacle of human history in general, and the American Negro history in particular, for it testifies to nothing less than the perpetual achievement of the impossible.","the things that most white people imagine that they can salvage from the storm of life is really, in sum, their innocence. It was this commodity precisely which I had to get rid of at once, literally, on pain of death. I am afraid that most of the white people I have ever known impressed me as being in the grip of a weird nostalgia, dreaming of a vanished state of security and order, against which dream, unfailingly and unconsciously, they tested and very often lost their lives. It is a terrible thing to say, but I am afraid that for a very long time the troubles of white people failed to impress me as being real trouble. They put me in mind of children crying because the breast has been taken away. Time and love have modified my tough-boy lack of charity, but the attitude sketched above was my first attitude and I am sure that there is a great deal of it left.","The real reason that nonviolence is considered to be a virtue in Negroes\u2014I am not speaking now of its racial value, another matter altogether\u2014is that white men do not want their lives, their self-image, or their property threatened.","The morning weighs on my shoulders with the dreadful weight of hope and I take the blue envelope which Jacques has sent me and tear it slowly into many pieces, watching them dance in the wind, watching the wind carry them away. Yet, as I turn and begin walking toward the waiting people, the wind blows some of them back on me.","I had decided to allow no room in the universe for something which shamed and frightened me.","The treatment accorded the Negro during the Second World War marks, for me, a turning point in the Negro\u2019s relation to America. To put it briefly, and somewhat too simply, a certain hope died, a certain respect for white Americans faded. One began to pity them, or to hate them. You must put yourself in the skin of a man who is wearing the uniform of his country, is a candidate for death in its defense, and who is called a \u201cnigger by his comrades-in-arms and his officers; who is almost always given the hardest, ugliest, most menial work to do; who knows that the white G.I. has informed the Europeans that he is subhuman (so much for the American male\u2019s sexual security); who does not dance at the U.S.O. the night white soldiers dance there, and does not drink in the same bars white soldiers drink in; and who watches German prisoners of war being treated by Americans with more human dignity than he has ever received at their hands. And who, at the same time, as a human being, is far freer in a strange land than he has ever been at home.\u201d","Why, you will go home and then you will find that home is not home any more. Then you will really be in trouble. As long as you stay here, you can always think: One day I will go home.","When he died I had been away from home for a little over a year. In that year I had had time to become aware of the meaning of all my father\u2019s bitter warnings, had discovered the secret of his proudly pursed lips and rigid carriage: I had discovered the weight of white people in the world. I saw that this had been for my ancestors and now would be for me an awful thing to live with and that the bitterness which had helped to kill my father could also kill me.","In Harlem, Negro policemen are feared more than whites, for they have more to prove and fewer ways to prove it","I did not know, however, that ancient glories imply, at least in the middle of the present century, present fatigue and, quite probably, paranoia; that there is a limit to the role of intelligence in human affairs; and that no people come into possession of a culture without having paid a heavy price for it.","Anyway, I have long had a very definite tendency to tune out the moment I come anywhere near either a pulpit or a soapbox.","About my interests: I don\u2019t know if I have any, unless the morbid desire to own a sixteen-millimeter camera and make experimental movies can be so classified. Otherwise, I love to eat and drink \u2013 it\u2019s my melancholy conviction that I\u2019ve scarcely ever had enough to eat (this is because it\u2019s impossible to eat enough if you\u2019re worried about the next meal) \u2013 and I love to argue with people who do not disagree with me too profoundly, and I love to laugh. I do not like bohemia, or bohemians, I do not like people whose principal aim is pleasure, and I do not like people who are earnest about anything. I don\u2019t like people who like me because I\u2019m a Negro; neither do I like people who find in the same accident grounds for contempt. I love America more than any other country in the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually. I think all theories are suspect, that the finest principles may have to be modified, or may even be pulverized by the demands of life, and that one must find, therefore, one\u2019s own moral center and move through the world hoping that this center will guide one aright. I consider that I have many responsibilities, but none greater than this: to last, as Hemingway says, and get my work done.","With this fearful intimation there opened in me a hatred for Giovanni which was as powerful as my love and which was nourished by the same roots.","No. It would help if I were able to feel guilty.But the end of innocence is also the end of guilt (112)","But, Cass, ask yourself, look out and ask yourself \u2013 wouldn\u2019t you hate all white people if they kept you in prison here?\u2019 They were rolling up startling Seventh Avenue. The entire population seemed to be in the streets, draped, almost, from lamp-posts, stoops, and hydrants, and walking through the traffic as though it were not there. \u2018Kept you here, and stunted you and starved you, and made you watch your mother and father and sister and lover and brother and son and daughter die or go mad or go under, before your very eyes? And not in a hurry, like from one day to the next, but, every day, every day, for years, for generations? Shit. They keep you here because you\u2019re black, while they go around jerking themselves off with all the jazz about the land of the free and the home of the brave. And they want you to jerk yourself off with the same music, too, only keep your distance. Some days, honey, I wish I could turn myself into one big fist and grind this miserable country to powder. Some days, I don\u2019t believe it has a right to exist. Now, you\u2019ve never felt like that, and Vivaldo\u2019s never felt like that. Vivaldo didn\u2019t want to know my brother was dying because he doesn\u2019t want to know that my brother would still be alive if he hadn\u2019t been born black.","For the history of the American Negro is unique also in this: that the question of his humanity, and of his rights therefore as a human being, became a burning one for several generations of Americans, so burning a question that it ultimately became one of those used to divide the nation.","There\'s no way not to suffer. But you try all kinds of ways to keep from drowning in it.","We are in the middle of an immense metamorphosis here, a metamorphosis which will, it is devoutly to be hoped, rob us of our myths and give us our history, which will destroy our attitudes and give us back our personalities. The mass culture, in the meantime, can only reflect our chaos: and perhaps we had better remember that this chaos contains life\u2014and a great transforming energy.","It is not too much to say that whoever wishes to become a truly moral human being (and let us not ask whether or not this is possible; I think we must believe that it is possible) must first divorce himself from all the prohibitions, crimes, and hypocrisies of the Christian church. If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time we got rid of Him.","One must be careful not to take refuge in any delusion.","When he was dead I realized that I had hardly ever spoken to him. When he had been dead a long time I began to wish I had. It seems to be typical of life in America, where opportunities, real and fancied, are thicker than anywhere else on the globe, that the second generation has no time to talk to the first.","It\u2019s a great city, Paris, a beautiful city\u2013\u2013and\u2013\u2013it was very good for me.","Love forces, at last, this humility: you cannot love if you cannot be loved, you cannot see if you cannot be seen.","Perhaps everybody has a garden of Eden, I don\u2019t know; but they have scarcely seen their garden before they see the flaming sword. Then, perhaps, life only offers the choice of remembering the garden or forgetting it. Either, or: it takes strength to remember, it takes another kind of strength to forget, it takes a hero to do both. People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget. Heroes are rare.","I saw my mother\'s face again, and felt, for the first time, how the stones of the road she had walked on must have bruised her feet. I saw the moonlit road where my father\'s brother died. And it brought something else back to me, and carried me past it, I saw my little girl again and felt Isabel\'s tears again, and I felt my own tears begin to rise. And I was yet aware that this was only a moment, that the world waited outside, as hungry as a tiger, and that trouble stretched above us, longer than the sky.","Out of this incredible brutality, we get the myth of the happy darky and Gone With the Wind. And the North Americans appear to believe these legends, which they have created and which absolutely nothing in reality corroborates, until today. And when these legends are attacked, as is happening now\u2014all over a globe which has never been and never will be White\u2014my countrymen become childishly vindictive and unutterably dangerous. The","I remember what it was like...to be young, very young. When everything, touching and tasting-everything- was so new, and even suffering was wonderful because it was so complete.James Baldwin","Yet, if the American Negro has arrived at his identity by virtue of the absoluteness of his estrangement from his past, American white men still nourish the illusion that there is some means of recovering the European innocence, of returning to a state in which black men do not exist. This is one of the greatest errors Americans can make. The identity they fought so hard to protect has, by virtue of that battle, undergone a change: Americans are as unlike any other white people in the world as it is possible to be. I do not think, for example, that it is too much to suggest that the American vision of the world-which allows so little reality, generally speaking, for any of the darker forces in human life, which tends until today to paint moral issues in glaring black and white owes a great deal to the battle waged by Americans to maintain between themselves and black men a human separation which could not be bridged. It is only now beginning to be borne in on us, very faintly, it must be admitted, very slowly, and very much against our will--that this vision of the world is dangerously inaccurate, and perfectly useless. For it protects our moral high-mindedness at the terrible expense of weakening our grasp of reality. People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.","She did not know why he so adored things that were so long dead; what sustenance they gave him, what secrets he hoped to wrest from them. But she understood, at least, that they did give him a kind of bitter nourishment, and that the secrets they held for him were a matter of his life and death. It frightened her because she felt that he was reaching for the moon and that he would, therefore, be dashed down against the rocks; but she did not say any of this.","Some moments in a life, and they needn\u2019t be very long or seem very important, can make up for so much in that life; can redeem, justify, that pain, that bewilderment, with which one lives, and invest one with the courage not only to endure it, but to profit from it; some moments teach one the price of the human connection: if one can live with one\u2019s own pain, then one respects the pain of others, and so, briefly, but transcendentally, we can release each other from pain.","It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have. --The Price of the Ticket, \u201cNo Name in the Street (1972; repr. 1985) \xa0 \xa0 The\u201d","When the Israelis pick up guns, or the Poles, or the Irish, or any white man in the world says \\"give me liberty, or give me death,\\" the entire white world applauds.

The country should be proud of them, too, but, alas, not many people in this country even know of their existence. And the reason for this ignorance is that a knowledge of the role these people played\u2014and play\u2014in American life would reveal more about America to Americans than Americans wish to know.","For this is your home, my friend, do not be driven from it; great men have done great things here, and will again, and we can make America what America must become. It will be hard, James, but you come from sturdy, peasant stock, men who picked cotton and dammed rivers and built railroads, and, in the teeth of the most terrifying odds, achieved an unassailable and monumental dignity.","There seems to be a vast amount of confusion in the Western world concerning these matters, but love and sexual activity are not synonymous: Only by becoming inhuman can the human being pretend that they are. The mare is not obliged to love the stallion, nor is the bull required to love the cow. They are doing what comes naturally.","People always seem to band together in accordance to a principle that has nothing to do with love, a principle that releases them from personal responsibility","If you know from whence you came, there are absolutely no limitations on where you can go.","It is cruel to have made me want to live only to make my death more bloody.","It is a fact that every American Negro bears a name that originally belonged to the white man whose chattel he was. I am called Baldwin because I was either sold by my African tribe or kidnapped out of it into the hands of a white Christian named Baldwin, who forced me to kneel at the foot of the cross. I am, then, both visibly and legally the descendant of slaves in a white, Protestant country, and this is what it means to be an American Negro, this is who he is\u2014a kidnapped pagan, who was sold like an animal and treated like one, who was once defined by the American Constitution as \u201cthree-fifths of a man, and who, according to the Dred Scott decision, had no rights that a white man was bound to respect.

I think that our youth is so badly educated--and it is inconceivably badly educated--is because education demands a certain daring, a certain independence of mind.

If there is one thing they cannot think about, very shortly they can\'t think about anything.","In America, though, life seems to move faster than anywhere else on the globe and each generation is promised more than it will get: which creates, in each generation, a furious, bewildered rage, the rage of people who cannot find solid ground beneath their feet. Just","And: the only way anything ever gets done is when you make up your mind to do it.","So that any writer, looking back over even so short a span of time as I am here forced to assess, finds that the things which hurt him and the things which helped him cannot be divorced from each other; he could be helped in a certain way only because he was hurt in a certain way; and his help is simply to be enabled to move from one conundrum to the next\u2014one is tempted to say that he moves from one disaster to the next.","You smiled at me the way you smiled at everyone, you told me what you told everyone\u2014and you tell nothing but lies.

They have forgotten that the religion that is now identified with their virtue and their power\u2014\u201cGod is on our side, says Dr. Verwoerd\u2014came out of a rocky piece of ground in what is now known as the Middle East before color was invented, and that in order for the Christian church to be established, Christ had to be put to death, by Rome, and that the real architect of the Christian church was not the disreputable, sunbaked Hebrew who gave it his name but the mercilessly fanatical and self-righteous St. Paul.\u201d","White people were, and are, astounded by the holocaust in Germany. They did not know that they could act that way. But I very much doubt whether black people were astounded\u2014at least, in the same way.","White Americans have contented themselves with gestures that are now described as \\"tokenism\\". For hard example, white Americans congratulate themselves on the 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation in the schools; they suppose, in spite of the mountain of evidence that has since accumulated to the contrary, that this was proof of a change of heart \u2013 or, as they like to say, progress. Perhaps. It all depends on how one reads the word \\"progress\\". Most of the Negroes I know do not believe that this immense concession would ever have been made if it had not been for the competition of the Cold War, and the fact that Africa was clearly liberating herself and therefore had, for political reasons, to be wooed by the descendants of her former masters. Had it been a matter of love or justice, the 1954 decision would surely have occurred sooner; were it not for the realities of power in this difficult era, it might very well not have occurred yet.","Some of the things written during those years, justifying, for example, the execution of the Rosenbergs, or the crucifixion of Alger Hiss (and the beatification of Whittaker Chambers) taught me something about the irresponsibility and cowardice of the liberal community which I will never forget. Their performance, then, yet more than the combination of ignorance and arrogance with which this community has always protected itself against the deepest implications of black suffering, persuaded me that brilliance without passion is nothing more than sterility. It must be remembered, after all, that I did not begin meeting these people at the point that they began to meet me: I had been delivering their packages and emptying their garbage and taking their tips for years. (And they don\u2019t tip well.) And what I watched them do to each other during the McCarthy era was, in some ways, worse than anything they had ever done to me, for I, at least, had never been mad enough to depend on their devotion. It seemed very clear to me that they were lying about their motives and were being blackmailed by their guilt; were, in fact, at bottom, nothing more than the respectable issue of various immigrants, struggling to hold on to what they had acquired.","The Americans have no sense of doom, none whatever. They do not recognize doom when they see it.","They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change\u2014cannot change\u2014until the North changes. The country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom. In the meantime, generations keep being born, bitterness is increased by incompetence, pride, and folly, and the world shrinks around us. It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one\u2019s own: in the face of one\u2019s victim, one sees oneself. Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we, this nation, have become.","The question of identity is a question involving the most profound panic\u2014a terror as primary as the nightmare of the mortal fall.","And have brought humanity to the edge of oblivion: because they think they are white.","No one in the world -- in the entire world -- know more -- knows Americans better or, odd as this may sound, loves them more than the American Negro. This is because he has had to watch you, outwit you, deal with you, and bear you, and sometimes even bleed and die with you, ever since we got here, that is, since both of us, black and white, got here -- and this is a wedding. Whether I like it or not, or whether you like it or not, we are bound together forever. We are part of each other.","I don\u2019t think that the Negro problem in America can be even discussed coherently without bearing in mind its context; its context being the history, traditions, customs, the moral assumptions and preoccupations of the country; in short, the general social fabric. Appearances to the contrary, no one in America escapes its effects and everyone in America bears some responsibility for it.","It\'s the only light we\'ve got in all this darkness","I cannot accept the proposition that the four-hundred-year travail of the American Negro should result merely in his attainment of the present level of American civilisation. I am far from convinced that being released from the African witch doctor was worthwhile if I am now - in order to support the moral contradictions and the spiritual aridity of my life - expected to become dependent on the American psychiatrist. It is a bargain I refuse.","He did not seem to know enough about the people in his novel. They did not seem to trust him. They were all named, more or less, all more or less destined, the pattern he wished them to describe was clear to him. But it did not seem clear to them. He could move them about but they themselves did not move. He put words in their mouths which they uttered sullenly, unconvinced. With the same agony, or greater, with which he attempted to seduce a woman, he was trying to seduce his people: he begged them to surrender up their privacy. And they refused - without, for all their ugly intransigence, showing the faintest desire to leave him. They were waiting for him to find the key, press the nerve, tell the truth.","In those days my mother was given to the exasperating and mysterious habit of having babies.","Maybe it\u2019s because you see people differently than you saw them before your trouble started.

Until I die there will be those moments, moments seeming to rise up out of the ground like Macbeth\'s witches, when his face will come before me, that face in all its changes, when the exact timbre of his voice and tricks of his speech will nearly burst my ears, when his smell will overpower my nostrils. Sometimes, in the days which are coming - God grant me the grace to live them: in the glare of the grey morning, sour-mouthed, eyelids raw and red, hair tangled and damp from my stormy sleep, facing, over coffee and cigarette smoke, last night\'s impenetrable, meaningless boy who will shortly rise and vanish like the smoke, I will see Giovanni again, as he was that night, so vivid, so winning, all of the light of that gloomy tunnel trapped around his head.","...the righteous must be able to locate the damned.","No society can smash the social contract and be exempt from the consequences, and the consequences are chaos for everybody in society.","The American Negro is a unique creation; he has no counterpart anywhere, and no predecessors.","Some of us, white and black, know how great a price has already been paid to bring into existence a new consciousness, a new people, an unprecedented nation.

For a very long time, for example, America prospered\u2014or seemed to prosper: this prosperity cost millions of people their lives. Now, not even the people who are the most spectacular recipients of the benefits of this prosperity are able to endure these benefits: they can neither understand them nor do without them, nor can they go beyond them. Above all, they cannot, or dare not, assess or imagine the price paid by their victims, or subjects, for this way of life, and so they cannot afford to know why the victims are revolting. They are forced, then, to the conclusion that the victims\u2014the barbarians\u2014are revolting against all established civilized values\u2014which is both true and not true\u2014and, in order to preserve these values, however stifling and joyless these values have caused their lives to be, the bulk of the people desperately seek out representatives who are prepared to make up in cruelty what both they and the people lack in conviction.

Force does not work the way its advocates seem to think it does. It does not, for example, reveal to the victim the strength of his adversary. On the contrary, it reveals the weakness, even the panic of his adversary, and this revelation invests the victim with patience. Furthermore, it is ultimately fatal to create too many victims. The victor can do nothing with these victims, for they do not belong to him, but\u2014to the victims. They belong to the people he is fighting. The people know this, and as inexorably as the roll call\u2014the honor roll\u2014of victims expands, so does their will become inexorable: they resolve that these dead, their brethren, shall not have died in vain. When this point is reached, however long the battle may go on, the victor can never be the victor: on the contrary, all his energies, his entire life, are bound up in a terror he cannot articulate, a mystery he cannot read, a battle he cannot win\u2014he has simply become the prisoner of the people he thought to cow, chain, or murder into submission.","You\u2019ve got to tell the world how to treat you.

And this assumption\u2014which, for example, makes the solution to the Negro problem depend on the speed with which Negroes accept and adopt white standards\u2014is revealed in all kinds of striking ways, from Bobby Kennedy\u2019s assurance that a Negro can become President in forty years to the unfortunate tone of warm congratulation with which so many liberals address their Negro equals. It is the Negro, of course, who is presumed to have become equal\u2014an achievement that not only proves the comforting fact that perseverance has no color but also overwhelmingly corroborates the white man\u2019s sense of his own value.","Why no,\\" he said, reasonably, and looked at his watch, \\"we can wait another hour if you like.

It does not require a spectacular degree of perception to realize that bitterness is here neither dead nor sleeping, and that the white man, believing what he wishes to believe, has misread the symbols. Quite often the Negro preacher descends to levels less abstract and leaves no doubt as to what is on his mind: the pressure of life in Harlem, the conduct of the Italian-Ethiopian war, racial injustice during the recent war, and the terrible possibility of yet another very soon. All these topics provide excellent springboards for sermons thinly coated with spirituality but designed mainly to illustrate the injustice of the white American and anticipate his certain and long overdue punishment.\u201d","Wash me, cried the slave to his Maker, and I shall be whiter, whiter than snow!","I stared at absurd Paris, which was as cluttered now, under the scalding sun, as the landscape of my heart.","N\xe3o adianta nada colocar a culpa nas pessoas ou na \xe9poca - cada um de n\xf3s \xe9 ao mesmo tempo todas essas pessoas. N\xf3s somos a nossa \xe9poca.","That day in Chartres they had passed through town and watched women kneeling at the edge of the water, pounding clothes against a flat, wooden board. Yves had watched them for a long time. They had wandered up and down the old crooked streets, in the hot sun; Eric remembered a lizard darting across a wall; and everywhere the cathedral pursued them. It is impossible to be in that town and not be in the shadow of those great towers; impossible to find oneself on those plains and not be troubled by that cruel and elegant, dogmatic and pagan presence. The town was full of tourists, with their cameras, their three-quarter coats, bright flowered dresses and shirts, their children, college insignia, Panama hats, sharp, nasal cries, and automobiles crawling like monstrous gleaming bugs over the laming, cobblestoned streets. Tourist buses, from Holland, from Denmark, from Germany, stood in the square before the cathedral. Tow-haired boys and girls, earnest, carrying knapsacks, wearing khaki-colored shorts, with heavy buttocks and thighs, wandered dully through the town. American soldiers, some in uniform, some in civilian clothes, leaned over bridges, entered bistros in strident, uneasy, smiling packs, circled displays of colored post cards, and picked up meretricious mementos, of a sacred character. All of the beauty of the town, all the energy of the plains, and all the power and dignity of the people seemed to have been sucked out of them by the cathedral. It was as though the cathedral demanded, and received, a perpetual, living sacrifice. It towered over the town, more like an affliction than a blessing, and made everything seem, by comparison with itself, wretched and makeshift indeed. The houses in which the people lived did not suggest shelter, or safety. The great shadow which lay over them revealed them as mere doomed bits of wood and mineral, set down in the path of a hurricane which, presently, would blow them into eternity. And this shadow lay heavy on the people, too. They seemed stunted and misshapen; the only color in their faces suggested too much bad wine and too little sun; even the children seemed to have been hatched in a cellar. It was a town like some towns in the American South, frozen in its history as Lot\'s wife was trapped in salt, and doomed, therefore, as its history, that overwhelming, omnipresent gift of God, could not be questioned, to be the property of the gray, unquestioning mediocre.","Hope? The word seemed to bang from wall to wall. Hope? No, I don\'t think there\'s any hope. We\'re too empty here...She touched her heart. This isn\'t a country at all, it\'s a collection of football players and Eagle Scouts. Cowards. We think we\'re happy. We\'re not. We\'re doomed.","Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have.","It doesn\'t do any good to blame people or the time-- one is oneself all those people. We are the time.","If you look helpless, people react to you in one way and if you look strong, or just come on strong, people react to you in another way, and, since you don\'t see what they see, this can be very painful.","It is easy for an African to hate the invader and drive him out of Africa, but it is very difficult for an American Negro to do this. He obviously can\'t do this to white people; there\'s no place to drive them. This is a country that belongs equally to us both. One has got to live together here or else there won\'t be any country.","Do you come in here often?\\" asked Giovanni suddenly.\\"No,\\" I said, \\"not very often.\\"\\"But you will come,\\" he teased, with a wonderful, mocking light on his face, \\"more often now?\\"I stammered: \\"Why?\\"\\"Ah!\\" cried Giovanni. \\"Don\'t you know when you have made a friend?\\"I knew I must look foolish and that my question was foolish too: \\"So soon?\\"\\"Why no,\\" he said, reasonably, and looked at his watch, \\"we can wait another hour if you like. We can become friends then. Or we can wait until closing time. We can become friends then. Or we can wait until tomorrow, only that means that you must come in here tomorrow and perhaps you have something else to do.","When Malcolm X, who is considered the movement\u2019s second-in-command, and heir apparent, points out that the cry of \u201cviolence was not raised, for example, when the Israelis fought to regain Israel, and, indeed, is raised only when black men indicate that they will fight for their rights, he is speaking the truth. The conquests of England, every single one of them bloody, are part of what Americans have in mind when they speak of England\u2019s glory. In the United States, violence and heroism have been made synonymous except when it comes to blacks, and the only way to defeat Malcolm\u2019s point is to concede it and then ask oneself why this is so.\u201d","This equation has placed our cities among the most dangerous in the world and has placed our youth among the most empty and most bewildered. The situation of our youth is not mysterious. Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them. They must, they have no other models. That is exactly what our children are doing. They are imitating our immorality, our disrespect for the pain of others.","They were so free that they believed in nothing; and didn\u2019t realize that this illusion was their only truth and that they were doing exactly as they had been told.","One of these days,\\" he said. \\"Everything bad will happen\u2014one of these days.","My progress reportconcerning my journey to the palace of wisdomis discouraging.I lack certain indispensable aptitudes.Furthermore, it appearsthat I packed the wrong things.","The world sees what it wishes to see, or, when the chips are down, what you tell it to see: it does not wish to see who, or what, or why you are.","This is because white Americans have supposed \u201cEurope and \u201ccivilization\u201d to be synonyms\u2014which they are not\u2014and have been distrustful of other standards and other sources of vitality, especially those produced in America itself, and have attempted to behave in all matters as though what was east for Europe was also east for them. What it comes to is that if we, who can scarcely be considered a white nation, persist in thinking of ourselves as one, we condemn ourselves, with the truly white nations, to sterility and decay, whereas if we could accept ourselves as we are, we might bring new life to the Western achievements, and transform them.\u201d","Unless a writer is extremely old when he dies, in which case he has probably become a neglected institution, his death must always be seen as untimely. This is because a real writer is always shifting and changing and searching. The world has many labels for him, of which the most treacherous is the label of \'Success.","The beast which Giovanni had awakened in me would never go to sleep again; but one day I would not be with Giovanni any more. And would I then, like all the others, find myself turning and following all kinds of boys down God knows what dark avenues, into what dark places? With this fearful intimation there opened in me hatred for Giovanni which was as powerful as my love and which was nourished by the same roots.","People, even if they are so thoughtless as to be born black, do not come into this world merely to provide mink coats and diamonds for chattering, trivial, pale matrons, or genocidal opportunities for their unsexed, unloved, and, finally, despicable men\u2014oh, pioneers!There will be bloody holding actions all over the world, for years to come: but the Western party is over, and the white man\'s sun has set. Period.","I went down again. My heart and I went down again. I was aware of her hand. I was aware of my breathing. I could no longer see it, but I was aware of her face.","while the excluded begin to realize, having endured everything, that they can endure everything. They do not know the precise shape of the future, but they know that the future belongs to them. They realize this\u2014paradoxically\u2014by the failure of the moral energy of their oppressors and begin, almost instinctively, to forge a new morality, to create the principles on which a new world will be built.","People find it very difficult to act on what they know. To act is to be committed, and to be committed is to be in danger.","What I find appalling\u2014and really dangerous\u2014is the American assumption that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest. It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult, implying, as it does, that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated. It forcibly suggests that the Southern attitude toward the Negro is also, essentially, the national attitude. When the South has trouble with its Negroes\u2014when the Negroes refuse to remain in their \u201cplace\u2014it blames \u201coutside\u201d agitators and \u201cNorthern interference.\u201d When the nation has trouble with the Northern Negro, it blames the Kremlin. And this, by no means incidentally, is a very dangerous thing to do. We thus give credit to the Communists for attitudes and victories which are not theirs. We make of them the champions of the oppressed, and they could not, of course, be more delighted.\u201d","On each piece of paper I found addresses, telephone numbers, memos of various rendezvous made and kept\u2014or perhaps not kept\u2014people met and remembered, or perhaps not remembered, hopes probably not fulfilled: certainly not fulfilled, or I would not have been standing on that street corner.","Lord, that Hollywood train, forever coming round the bend!","Confusion is a luxury which only the very, very young can possibly afford and you are not that young anymore.","Even the most incorrigible maverick has to be born somewhere. He may leave the group that produced him--he may be forced to--but nothing will efface his origins, the marks of which he carries with him everywhere. I think it is important to know this and even find it a matter for rejoicing, as the strongest people do, regardless of their station. On this acceptance, literally, the life of a writer depends.","People who imagine that history flatters them (as it does, indeed, since they wrote it) are impaled on their history like a butterfly on a pin and become incapable of seeing or changing themselves, or the world. This is the place in which it seems to me, most white Americans find themselves. Impaled. They are dimly, or vividly, aware that the history they have fed themselves is mainly a lie, but they do not know how to release themselves from it, and they suffer enormously from the resulting personal incoherence.","The black man in our midst carried murder in his heart, he wanted vengeance. We carried murder too, we wanted peace.","The real troubles with living is that living is so banal.","It\'s always at the hour of trouble and confrontation that the missing member aches.","Our people\\" have functioned in this country for nearly a century as political weapons, the trump card up the enemies\' sleeve; anything promised Negroes at election time is also a threat leveled at the opposition; in the struggle for mastery the Negro is the pawn.","Life only offers the choice of remembering the garden or forgetting it. Either, or: it takes strength to remember, it takes another kind of strength to forget, it takes a hero to do both. People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget. Heroes are rare.","He was one of those people who, quick to laugh, are slow to anger; so that their anger, when it comes, is all the more impressive, seeming to leap from some unsuspected crevice like a fire which will bring the whole house down.","The journey to the grave is already begun, the journey to corruption is, always, already, half over.","In the Negro world, as in the white world, Negroes who have money band together and try to ignore the existence of their unluckier brothers. That is the way the love of money works. But neither money, nor the love of it, is the root of all evil. The importance of money is simply that power in the world does not exist without it and power in the world is what almost everyone would like to have.","Vile as I am, states one of the characters in Dostoevski\u2019s The Idiot, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the wagons that bring bread to humanity. For the wagons that bring bread to humanity, without any moral basis for conduct, may coldly exclude a considerable part of humanity from enjoying what is brought; so it has been already.\u201d","These captive men are the hidden price for a hiden lie: the righteous must be able to locate the damned.","Some moments in a life, and they needn\'t be very long or seem very important, can make up for so much in that life; can redeem, justify, that pain, that bewilderment, with which one lives, and invest one with the courage not only to endure it, but to profit from it; some moments teach one the price of human connection: if one can live with one\'s own pain, then one respects the pain of others, and so, briefly, but transcendentally, we can release each other from pain.","Most people are not naturally reflective any more than they are naturally malicious, and the white man prefers to keep the black man at a certain human remove because it is easier for him thus to preserve his simplicity and avoid being called to account for crimes committed by his forefathers, or his neighbors.","And her mother still struggled in these white kitchens in town, humming sweet hymns, tiny, mild eyed and bent, her father still labored on the oyster boats; after a lifetime of labor, should they drop dead tomorrow, there would not be a penny for their burial clothes.","It is the responsibility of free men to trust and to celebrate what is constant\u2014birth, struggle, and death are constant, and so is love, though we may not always think so\u2014and to apprehend the nature of change, to be able and willing to change. I speak of change not on the surface but in the depths\u2014change in the sense of renewal. But renewal becomes impossible if one supposes things to be constant that are not\u2014safety, for example, or money, or power. One clings then to chimeras, by which one can only be betrayed, and the entire hope\u2014the entire possibility\u2014of freedom disappears. And by destruction I mean precisely the abdication by Americans of any effort really to be free.","Wright puts this idea can only proceed from the assumption\u2014not entirely unsound\u2014that Americans, who evade, so far as possible, all genuine experience, have therefore no way of assessing the experience of others and no way of establishing themselves in relation to any way of life which is not their own.","A mob is not autonomous: it executes the real will of the people who rule the State.","But our humanity is our burden, our life; we need not battle for it; we need only to do what is infinitely more difficult\u2014that is, accept it.","For the rebirth of the soul was perpetual; only rebirth every hour could stay the hand of Satan.","The projects in Harlem are hated. They are hated almost as much as policemen, and this is saying a great deal. And they are hated for the same reason: both reveal, unbearably, the real attitude of the white world, no matter how many liberal speeches are made, no matter how many lofty editorials are written, no matter how many civil-rights commissions are set up.","Since we live in an age in which silence is not only criminal but suicidal, I have been making as much noise as I can, here in Europe, on radio and television\u2014in fact, have just returned from a land, Germany, which was made notorious by a silent majority not so very long ago.","Men do not like to be protected, it emasculates them. This is what black men know, it is the reality they have lived with; it is what white men do not want to know. It is not a pretty thing to be a father and be ultimately dependent on the power and kindness of some other man for the well-being of your house.","Only a man can see in the face of a woman the girl she was. It is a secret which can be revealed only to a particular man, and, then, only at his insistence. But men have no secrets, except from women, and never grow up in the way that women do. It is very much harder, and it takes much longer, for a man to grow up, and he could never do it at all without women. This is a mystery which can terrify and immobilize a woman, and it is always the key to her deepest distress.","The South is very beautiful but its beauty makes one sad because the lives that people live, and have lived here, are so ugly that now they cannot even speak to one another. It does not demand much reflection to be appalled at the inevitable state of mind achieved by people who dare not speak freely about those things which most disturb them.","I\'m beginning to think,\' she said, \'that growing means learning more and more about anguish. That poison becomes your diet-- you drink a little of it everyday. Once you\'ve seen it, you can\'t stop seeing it-- that\'s the trouble. And it can, it can\' -- she passed her hand wearily over her brown again-- \'drive you mad.","The American soil is full of corpses of my ancestors\u2013 through 400 years and at least three wars. Why is my freedom, my citizenship, in question now?","I don\u2019t know any writers who don\u2019t drink.","The person who distrusts himself has no touchstone for reality - for this touchstone can be only oneself. Such a person interpose between himself and reality nothing less than a labyrinth of attitudes. And these attitudes, furthermore, though the person is usually unaware of it (is unaware of so much), are historical and public attitudes.","At the root of the American Negro problem is the necessity of the American white man to find a way of living with the Negro in order to be able to live with himself.","But art and ideas come out of the passion and torment of experience: it is impossible to have a real relationship to the first if one\u2019s aim is to be protected from the second.","Therefore, whatever white people do not know about Negroes reveals, precisely and inexorably, what they do not know about themselves.","The energy that was buried with the rise of the Christian nations must come back into the world; nothing can prevent it. Many of us, I think, both long to see this happen and are terrified of it, for though this transformation contains the hope of liberation, it also imposes a necessity for great change. But in order to deal with the untapped and dormant force of the previously subjugated, in order to survive as a human, moving, moral weight in the world, America and all the Western nations will be forced to reexamine themselves and release themselves from many thing that are now taken to be sacred, and to discard nearly all the assumptions that have been used to justify their lives and their anguish and their crimes so long.","I love a few people and they love me and some of them are white, and isn\'t love more important than color?","It is said that [Shakespeare\'s] time was easier than ours, but I doubt it\u2014no time can be easy if one is living through it.","Any honest examination of the national life proves how far we are from the standard of human freedom with which we began. The recovery of this standard demands of everyone who loves this country a hard look at himself, for the greatest achievements must begin somewhere, and they always begin with the person. If we are not capable of this examination, we may yet become one of the most distinguished and monumental failures in the history of nations. --\u201cNobody Knows My Name, in Partisan Review\u201d","It had been so once; it had almost been so once. I could make it so again, I could make it real. It only demanded a short, hard strength for me to become myself again.","I know a lot of people done took their own lives and they\'re walking up and down the streets today and some of them is preaching the gospel and some is sitting in the seats of the mighty. Now, you remember that. If the world wasn\'t so full of dead folks maybe those of us that\'s trying to live wouldn\'t have to suffer so bad.","There is something fantastic in the spectacle I now present to myself of having run so far, so hard, across the ocean even, only to find myself brought up short once more before the bulldog in my own backyard\u2014the yard, in the meantime, having grown smaller and the bulldog bigger.","I learned in New Jersey that to be a Negro meant, precisely, that one was never looked at but was simply at the mercy of the reflexes the color of one\u2019s skin caused in other people\u2026That year in New Jersey lives in my mind as though it were the year during which, having an unsuspected predilection for it, I first contracted some dread, chronic disease, the unfailing symptom of which is a kind of blind fever, a pounding in the skull and fire in the bowels\u2026There is not a Negro alive who does not have this rage in his blood\u2013one has the choice, merely, of living with it consciously or surrendering to it. As for me, this fever has recurred in me, and does, and will until the day I die.","History is not the past. It is the present. We carry our history with us. We are our history. If we pretend otherwise, we are literally criminals.","If Americans were not so terrified of their private selves, they would never have needed to invent and could never have become so dependent on what they still call \u201cthe Negro problem. This problem, which they invented in order to safeguard their purity, has made of them criminals and monsters, and it is destroying them; and this not from anything blacks may or may not be doing but because of the role a guilty and constricted white imagination has assigned to the blacks. That the scapegoat pays for the sins of others is well known, but this is only legend, and a revealing one at that. In fact, however the scapegoat may be made to suffer, his suffering cannot purify the sinner; it merely incriminates him the more, and it seals his damnation. The scapegoat, eventually, is released, to death: his murderer continues to live.\u201d","I was also able to see that the principles governing the rites and customs of the churches in which I grew up did not differ from the principles governing the rites and customs of other churches, white. The principles were Blindness, Loneliness, and Terror, the first principle necessarily and actively cultivated in order to deny the two others. I would love to believe that the principles were Faith, Hope, and Charity, but this is clearly not so for most Christians, or for what we call the Christian world.","He wished he could rescue her, that it was within his power to rescue her and make her life less hard. But it was only love which could accomplish the miracle of making a life bearable -- only love, and love itself mostly failed; and he had never loved her. He had used her to find out something about himself. And even this was not true. He had used her in the hope of avoiding a confrontation with himself which he had, nevertheless, and with a vengeance, been forced to endure.","It must be remembered that the oppressed and the oppressor are bound together within the same society; they accept the same criteria, they share the same beliefs, they both alike depend on the same reality.","People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget. Heroes are rare.","Why, you will go home and then you will find that home is not home anymore. Then you will really be in trouble. As long as you stay here, you can always think: One day I will go home.","It was not only colored people who praised John, since they could not, John felt, in any case really know; but white people also said it, in fact had said it first and said it still. It was when John was five years old and in the first grade that he was first noticed; and since he was noticed by an eye altogether alien and impersonal, he began to perceive, in wild uneasiness, his individual existence.","An identity is questioned only when it is menaced...Identity would seem to be the garment with which one covers the nakedness of the self...","It is rare indeed that people give. Most people guard and keep; they suppose that it is they themselves and what they identify with themselves that they are guarding and keeping, whereas what they are actually guarding and keeping is their system of reality and what they assume themselves to be. One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself - that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving. And, after all, one can give freedom only by setting someone free. This, in the case of the Negro, the American republic has never become sufficiently mature to do. White Americans have contented themselves with gestures that are now described as \u2018tokenism.","How can one... dream of power in any other terms than in the symbols of power?","The man does not remember the hand that struck him, the darkness that frightened him, as a child; nevertheless, the hand and darkness remain with him, indivisible from himself forever, part of the passion that drives him wherever he thinks to take flight.","Is it possible to describe as a culture what may simply be, after all, a history of oppression? That is, is this history and these present facts, which involve so many millions of people who are divided from each other by so many miles of the globe, which operates, and has operated, under such very different conditions, to such different effects, and which has produced so many different subhistories, problems, traditions, possibilities, aspirations, assumptions, languages, hybrids\u2014is this history enough to have made of the earth\u2019s black populations anything that can legitimately be described as a culture? For what, beyond the fact that all black men at one time or another left Africa, or have remained there, do they really have in common?","It is part of the price the Negro pays for his position in this society that, as Richard Wright points out, he is almost always acting. A Negro learns to gauge precisely what reaction the alien person facing him desires, and he produces it with disarming artlessness. The friends I had, growing up and going to work, grew more bitter every day; and, conversely, they learned to hide this bitterness and to fit into the pattern Gentile and Jew alike had fixed for them.","The woman on the bed was old, her life was fading as the mist rose. She thought of her mother as already in the grave; and she would not let herself be strangled by the hands of the dead. \u201cI\u2019m going, Ma, she said. \u201cI got to go.\u201d","What it comes to is that if we, who can scarcely be considered a white nation, persist in thinking of ourselves as one, we condemn ourselves, with the truly white nations, to sterility and decay, whereas if we could accept ourselves as we are, we might bring new life to the Western achievements, and transform them.","For the horrors of the American Negro\u2019s life there has been almost no language.","Come out, come out, wherever you are!","The dream of safety dies hard.","It demands great spiritual resilience not to hate the hater whose foot is on your neck, and an even greater miracle of perception and charity not to teach your child to hate. The Negro boys and girls who are facing mobs today come out of a long line of improbable aristocrats\u2014the only genuine aristocrats this country has produced.","I am not trying to be m\xe9chant when I talk about women. I respect women\u2014very much\u2014for their inside life, which is not like the life of a man.","The paradox\u2014and a fearful paradox it is\u2014is that the American Negro can have no future anywhere, on any continent, as long as he is unwilling to accept his past. To accept one\u2019s past\u2014one\u2019s history\u2014is not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it. An invented past can never be used; it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought. How can the American Negro\u2019s past be used? The unprecedented price demanded\u2014and at this embattled hour of the world\u2019s history\u2014is the transcendence of the realities of color, of nations, and of altars.","When I watched all the children, their copper, brown, and beige faces staring up at me as I taught Sunday school, I felt that I was committing a crime in talking about the gentle Jesus, in telling them to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life. Were only Negroes to gain this crown? Was Heaven, then, to be merely another ghetto? Perhaps I might have been able to reconcile myself even to this if I had been able to believe that there was any loving-kindness to be found in the haven I represented. But I had been in the pulpit too long and I had seen too many monstrous things. I don\u2019t refer merely to the glaring fact that the minister eventually acquires houses and Cadillacs while the faithful continue to scrub floors and drop their dimes and quarters and dollars into the plate. I really mean that there was no love in the church. It was a mask for hatred and self-hatred and despair. The transfiguring power of the Holy Ghost ended when the service ended, and salvation stopped at the church door.","Assimilation was frequently but another name for the very special brand of relations between human beings which had been imposed by colonialism. These relations demanded that the individual, torn from the context to which he owed his identity, should replace his habits of feeling, thinking, and acting by another set of habits which belonged to the strangers who dominated him.","It\u2019s very hard to live with that, said Eric. \u201cI mean, with the sense that one is never what one seems \u2014 never \u2014 and yet, what one seems to be is probably, in some sense, almost exactly what one is.\u201d","There is nothing more boring, anyway, than sexual activity as an end in itself, and a great many people who came out of the closet should reconsider.","He looked like a baby, his mouth half open, his cheek flused, his curly hair darkening the pillow and half hiding his damp round forehead and his long eyelashes glinting slightly in the summer sun. We were both naked and the sheet we had used as a cover was tangled around our feet. Joey\'s body was brown, was sweaty, the most beautiful creation I had ever seen til then. I would have touched him to wake him up but something stopped me. I was suddenly afraid. Perhaps it was because he looked so innocent lying there, with such perfect trust; my own body suddenly seemed gross and crushing and the desire which was rising in me seemed monstrous.","That cop,\\" Fonny says, \\"that cop.\\" \\"What about that cop?\\" But I am suddenly, and I don\'t know why, as still and as dry as a stone: with fear. \\"He\'s going to try to get me,\\" Fonny says. \\"How? You didn\'t do anything wrong. The Italian lady said so, and she said that she would swear to it.\\" \\"That\'s why he\'s going to try to get me,\\" Fonny says. \\"White men don\'t like it at all when a white lady tells them, You a boatful of motherfuckers, and the black cat was right, and you can kiss my ass.\\" He grins. \\"Because that\'s what she told him. In front of a whole lot of people. And he couldn\'t do shit. And he ain\'t about to forget it.","It does seem - well, difficult - to be at the mercy of some gross, unshaven stranger before you can begin to be yourself.","Nem o amor nem o terror deixam a gente cega: s\xf3 a indiferen\xe7a faz isso.","I did not tell him my decision, that would have broken my will. I did not wait to have breakfast with him but only drank some coffee and made an excuse to go home. I knew the excuse did not fool Joey; but he did not know how to protest or insist; he did not know that this was all he needed to have done. Then I, who had seen him that summer nearly every day till then, no longer went to see him. He did not come to see me. I would have been very happy to see him if he had, but the manner of my leavetaking had begun a constriction which neither of us knew how to arrest. When I finally did see him, more or less by accident, near the end of the summer, I made up a long and totally untrue story about a girl I was going with and when school began again I picked up with a rougher, older crowd and was very nasty to Joey. And the sadder this made him, the nastier I became. He moved away at last, out of the neighborhood, away from our school, and I never saw him again.","I wish to God I may die if I don\u2019t love you. There ain\u2019t no sky above us if I don\u2019t love you","People who believe that they are strong-willed and the masters of their destiny can only continue to believe this by becoming specialists in self-deception. Their decisions are not really decisions at all\u2014 a real decision makes one humble, one knows that it is at the mercy of more things than can be named\u2014 but elaborate systems of evasion, of illusion, designed to make themselves and the world appear to be what they and the world are not\u2026..I had decided to allow no room in the universe for something which shamed and frightened me. I succeeded very well\u2014 by not looking at the universe, by not looking at myself, by remaining, in effect, in constant motion.","And I felt myself flow toward him, as a river rushes when the ice breaks up.","Yet, if the American Negro has arrived at his identity by virtue of the absoluteness of his estrangement from his past, American white men still nourish the illusion that there is some means of recovering the European innocence, of returning to a state in which black men do not exist.","ANY REAL CHANGE IMPLIES THE breakup of the world as one has always known it, the loss of all that gave one an identity, the end of safety. And at such a moment, unable to see and not daring to imagine what the future will now bring forth, one clings to what one knew, or thought one knew; to what one possessed or dreamed that one possessed. Yet, it is only when a man is able, without bitterness or self-pity, to surrender a dream he has long cherished or a privilege he has long possessed that he is set free\u2014he has set himself free\u2014for higher dreams, for greater privileges. All men have gone through this, go through it, each according to his degree, throughout their lives. It is one of the irreducible facts of life. And remembering this, especially since I am a Negro, affords me almost my only means of understanding what is happening in the minds and hearts of white Southerners today.","We should certainly know by now that it is one thing to overthrow a dictator or repel an invader and quite another thing really to achieve a revolution. Time and time and time again, the people discover that they have merely betrayed themselves into the hands of yet another Pharaoh, who, since he was necessary to put the broken country together, will not let them go. Perhaps, people being the conundrums that they are, and having so little desire to shoulder the burden of their lives, this is what will always happen. But at the bottom of my heart I do not believe this. I think that people can be better than that, and I know that people can be better than they are. We are capable of bearing a great burden, once we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is.","You stop that,\u2019 he said, in a voice which he did not recognise. \u2018You stop that. You stop trying to kill me. It\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m white. It\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re black. It\u2019s not my fault he\u2019s dead.","Her long narrow eyes darkened with whatever it was they were beginning to see.","Terrifying, that the loss of intimacy with one person results in the freezing over of the world, and the loss of oneself! And terrifying that the terms of love are so rigorous, its checks and liberties so tightly bound together.","The fear that I heard in my father\'s voice... when he realized that I really believed I could do, anything a white boy could do, and had every intention of proving it, was not at all like the fear I heard when one of us was ill or had fallen down the stairs or strayed too far from the house. It was another fear, a far that the child, in challenging the white world\'s assumptions, was putting himself in the path of destruction.","It was as though I were yelling up to Heaven and Heaven would not hear me. And if Heaven would not hear me- to wash me, to make me clean- then utter disaster was my portion.","Well, hell, if people keep telling you you ain\u2019t no good\u2019 - she [Leona] tried to laugh - \u2018you bound to turn out pretty bad.","One of the things, though, that has always afflicted the American reality and the American vision is this aversion to history. History is not something you read about in a book, history is not even the past\u2014it\u2019s the present. Because everybody operates, whether or not we know it, out of assumptions which are produced and produced only by our history. Now the history of this country is not bloodier than other countries, but it\u2019s bloody. It is not more criminal than that of other countries, but it\u2019s criminal. Or in short, it\u2019s not worse than the history of France or England or any country we can name\u2014but it\u2019s different.","White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this \u2013 which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never \u2013 the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.","I wish I had heard him more clearly: an oblique confession is always a plea.","My novel\'s about Brooklyn.\\" \\"The tree? Or the kids or the murderers or the junkies?\\" Vivaldo swallowed. \\"All of them.\\" \\"That\'s quite an assignment. And if you don\'t mind my saying so, it sounds just a little bit old fashioned.\\" He put his hand before his mouth and burped. \\"Brooklyn\'s been done. And done.","I do not know what I would do if you left me.\\" For the first time I felt the suggestion of a threat in his voice\u2014or I put it there. \\"I have been alone so long\u2014I do not think I would be able to live if I had to be alone again.","He laughed. \'Baby. Baby. Baby. I love you. And I\'m going to build us a table and a whole lot of folks are going to be eating off it for a long, long time to come.","It was another fear, a fear that the child, in challenging the white world\'s assumptions, was putting himself in the path of destruction.","And they would not believe me precisely because they knew what I said was true.","Yes, Mama. I\u2019m going to try to love the Lord. At this there sprang into his mother\u2019s face something startling, beautiful, unspeakably sad\u2014as though she were looking far beyond him at a long, dark road, and seeing on that road a traveler in perpetual danger. Was it he, the traveler? or herself? or was she thinking of the cross of Jesus?\u201d","He had been bruised, so to speak, so badly that the eyes of strangers lacerated him like salt.","I feel in myself now a faint, a dreadful stirring of what so overwhelmingly stirred in me then, great thirsty heat, and trembling, and tenderness so painful I thought my heart would burst. But out of this astounding, intolerable pain came joy; we gave each other joy that night.","If we\u2014and now I mean the relatively conscious whites and the relatively conscious blacks, who must, like lovers, insist on, or create, the consciousness of the others\u2014do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world. If we do not now dare everything, the fulfillment of that prophecy, re-created from the Bible in song by a slave, is upon us: God gave Noah the rainbow sign, No more water, the fire next time!","The people who think of themselves as White have the choice of becoming human or irrelevant.","The sunlight came into the room with the peacefulness one remembers from rooms in one\'s early childhood\u2014a sunlight encountered later only in one\'s dreams.","consider that I have many responsibilities, but none greater than this: to last, as Hemingway says, and get my work done. I want to be an honest man and a good writer.","Uncle Tom is, for example, if he is called uncle, a kind of saint. He is there, he endures, he will forgive us, and this is a key to that image. But if he is not uncle, if he is merely Tom, he is a danger to everybody. He will wreak havoc on the countryside. When he is Uncle Tom he has no sex\u2014when he is Tom, he does\u2014and this obviously says much more about the people who invented this myth than it does about the people who are the object of it.","There were pauses in the music for the rushing, calling, halting piano. Everything would stop except the climbing of the soloist; he would reach a height and everything would join him, the violins first and then the horns; and then the deep blue bass and the flute and the bitter trampling drums; beating, beating and mounting together and stopping with a crash like daybreak. When I first heard the Messiah I was alone; my blood bubbled like fire and wine; I cried; like an infant crying for its mother\u2019s milk; or a sinner running to meet Jesus.","One would have to hold in the mind forever two ideas which seemed to be in opposition. The first idea was acceptance\u2026 totally without rancor, of life as it is, and men as they are: in the light of this idea, it goes without saying that injustice is a commonplace. But this did not mean that one could be complacent, for the second idea was of equal power: that one must never, in one\u2019s own life, accept these injustices as commonplace but must fight them with all one\u2019s strength. (Baldwin, 84)\u201d","The story of my childhood is the usual bleak fantasy, and we can dismiss it with the restrained observation that I certainly would not consider living it again. In those days my mother was given to the exasperating and mysterious habit of having babies. As they were born, I took them over with one hand and held a book with the other. The children probably suffered, though they have since been kind enough to deny it, and in this way I read Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin and A Tale of Two Cities over and over and over again; in this way, in fact, I read just about everything I could get my hands on\u2014except the Bible, probably because it was the only book I was encouraged to read.","Neither civilized reason nor Christian love would cause any of those people to treat you as they presumably wanted to be treated; only the fear of your power to retaliate would cause them to do that, or to seem to do it, which was (and is) good enough.","Artists are the only people in a society who will tell that society the truth about itself.","To smash something is the ghetto\'s chronic need. Most of the time it is the members of the ghetto who smash each other, and themselves. But as long as the ghetto walls are standing there will always come a moment when these outlets do not work.","He was waiting, I think, for me to cross that space and take him in my arms again\u2014waiting, as one waits at a deathbed for the miracle one dare not disbelieve, which will not happen.","Women don\'t see men the way men want to be seen. They see all the tender places, all the places where blood could flow.","Malcolm\u2014the world\u2019s much more like me than it is likeyou. People recognize me. They see me in their mirror. But they don\u2019t hardly eversee you. You\u2019re not in the mirror with them.","The world tends to trap and immobilize you in the role you play; and it is not always easy\u2014in fact, it is always extremely hard\u2014to maintain a kind of watchful, mocking distance between oneself as one appears to be and oneself as one actually is.","The dead man mattered, the new life mattered; blackness and whiteness did not matter; to believe that they did was to acquiesce in one\'s own destruction. Hatred, which could destroy so much, never failed to destroy the man who hated and this was an immutable law.","...a boy with an unspeakable past was a man with an unendurable future. He was good to look at, good to dance with, probably good to sleep with: but he was no longer good for love.","You might feel different out there, with all the sunshine and oranges and all.","The time has come to realize that the interracial drama acted out on the American continent has not only created a new black man, it has created a new white man, too. . .the history of the American Negro problem is not merely shameful, it is also something of an achievement. For even when the worst has been said, it must also be added that the perpetual challenge posed by this problem was always, somehow, perpetually met. . . This world is white no longer, and it will never be white again.","He made me think of home\u2014perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.","Terrifying, that the loss of intimacy with one person results in the freezing over of the world, and the loss of oneself.","Perhaps it now occurs to him that in this need to establish himself in his relation to his past [the African American] is most American, that this depthless alienation from oneself and one\'s people is, in sum, the American experience.","I am very much concerned that American Negroes achieve their freedom here in the United States. But I am also concerned for their dignity, for the health of their souls, and must oppose any attempt that Negroes may make to do to others what has been done to them. I think I know\u2014we see it around us every day\u2014the spiritual wasteland to which that road leads. It is so simple a fact and one that is so hard, apparently, to grasp: Whoever debases others is debasing himself.","At length, she lay beside him like a burden laid down at evening which must be picked up once more in the morning.","Being in trouble can have a funny effect on the mind. I don\'t know if I can explain this. You go through some days and you seem to be hearing people and you seem to be talking to them and you seem to be doing your work, or, at least, your work gets done; but you haven\'t seen or heard a soul and if someone asked you what you have done that day you\'d have to think awhile before you could answer. But at the same time, and even on the self-same day--and this is what is hard to explain--you see people like you never saw them before. They shine as bright as a razor. Maybe it\'s because you see people differently than you saw them before your trouble started. Maybe you wonder about them more, but in a different way, and this makes them very strange to you. Maybe you get scared and numb, because you don\'t know if you can depend on people for anything, anymore.And, even if they wanted to do something, what could they do?","If you think of them as dirty, then they will be dirty- they will be dirty because you will be giving nothing","he sat in an armchair, overlooking a foreign sea, still struggling to find the grace which would allow him to bear that revelation. For the meaning of revelation is that what is revealed is true, and must be borne.","The body in the mirror forces me to turn and face it. And I look at my body, which is under sentence of death. It is lean, hard, and cold, the incarnation of a mystery. And I do not know what moves in this body, what this body is searching. It is trapped in my mirror as it is trapped in time and it hurries toward revelation.","For Bigger\u2019s tragedy is not that he is cold or black or hungry, not even that he is American, black; but that he has accepted a theology that denies him life, that he admits the possibility of his being sub-human and feels constrained, therefore, to battle for his humanity according to those brutal criteria bequeathed him at his birth. But our humanity is our burden, our life; we need not battle for it; we need only to do what is infinitely more difficult\u2014that is, accept it.","Much has been written of love turning to hatred, of the heart growing cold with the death of love. It is a remarkable process. It is far more terrible than anything I have ever read about it, more terrible than anything I will ever be able to say. I","Other people cannot see what I see whenever I look into your father\'s face, for behind your father\'s face as it is today are all those other faces which were his.","The crime of which you discover slowly you are guilty is not so much that you are aware, which is bad enough, but that other people see that you are and cannot bear to watch it, because it testifies to the fact that they are not.","You were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity, and in as many ways as possible, that you were a worthless human being. You were not expected to aspire to excellence: you were expected to make peace with mediocrity.","But the Negro\u2019s experience of the white world cannot possibly create in him any respect for the standards by which the white world claims to live.","Furthermore, it is now absolutely clear that white people are a minority in the world\u2014so severe a minority that they now look rather more like an invention\u2014and that they cannot possibly hope to rule it any longer. If this is so, why is it not also possible that they achieved their original dominance by stealth and cunning and bloodshed and in opposition to the will of Heaven, and not, as they claim, by Heaven\u2019s will?","In short, we, the black and the white, deeply need each other here if we are really to become a nation- if we really, that is, to achieve our identity, our maturity, as men and women. To create one nation has proved to be a hideously difficult task.","The universe, which is not merely the stars and the moon and the planets, flowers, grass, and trees, but other people, has evolved no terms for your existence, has made no room for you, and if love will not swing wide the gates, no other power will or can. And if one despairs - as who has not? - of human love, God\'s love alone is left.","The only thing white people have that black people need, or should want, is power--and no one holds power forever. White people cannot, in the generality, be taken as models of how to live. Rather, the white man is himself in sore need of new standards, which will release him from his confusion and place him once again in fruitful communion with the depths of his own being.","The occurrence of an event is not the same thing as knowing what it is that one has lived through. Most people had not lived--nor could it, for that matter, be said that they had died--through any of their terrible events. They had simply been stunned by the hammer. They passed their lives thereafter in a kind of limbo of denied and unexamined pain. The great question that faced him this morning was whether of not he had ever, really, been present at his life. For if he had ever been present, then he was present still, and his world would open up before him.","It is considered a rather cheerful axiom that all Americans distrust politicians. (No one takes the further and less cheerful step of considering just what effect this mutual contempt has on either the public or the politicians, who have, indeed, very little to do with one another.)","I am speaking very seriously, and this is not an overstatement: I picked cotton, I carried it to the market, I built the railroads under someone else\'s whip for nothing. For nothing!","Life is tragic, and therefore unutterably beautiful.","What it comes to, finally, is that the nation has spent a large part of its time and energy looking away from one of the principal facts of its life. This failure to look reality in the face diminishes a nation as it diminishes a person, and it can only be described as unmanly. And in exactly the same way that the South imagines that it \u201cknows the Negro, the North imagines that it has set him free. Both camps are deluded. Human freedom is a complex, difficult\u2014and private\u2014thing. If we can liken life, for a moment, to a furnace, then freedom is the fire which burns away illusion. Any honest examination of the national life proves how far we are from the standard of human freedom with which we began. The recovery of this standard demands of everyone who loves this country a hard look at himself, for the greatest achievements must begin somewhere, and they always begin with the person. If we are not capable of this examination, we may yet become one of the most distinguished and monumental failures in the history of nations.\u201d","For, without love, pleasure withers quickly, becomes a foul taste on the palate, and pleasure\u2019s inventions are soon exhausted. There must be a soul within the body you are holding, a soul which you are striving to meet, a soul which is striving to meet yours.","It seemed, then, that a lifetime would not be long enough for me to act with Joey the act of love.","The writer trapped among a speechless people is in danger of becoming speechless himself. For then he has no mirror, no corroborations of his essential reality; and this means that he has no grasp of the reality of the people around him.","But in the end, it is the threat of universal extinction over all the world today that changes totally and forever the nature of reality and brings into devastating question the true meaning of man\u2019s history. We human beings now have the power to exterminate ourselves. This seems to be the entire sum of our achievements. We have taken this journey and arrived at this place in God\u2019s name. This then, is the best that God - the white God - can do. If that is so, then it is time to replace him.","They knew that no one heard, that bloodless people cannot be made to bleed. So they blew what everyone had heard before, they reassured everyone that nothing terrible was happening.","Nevertheless, beneath me\u2014along the river bank, beneath the bridges, in the shadow of the walls, I could almost hear the collective, shivering sigh\u2014were lovers and ruins, sleeping, embracing, coupling, drinking, staring out at the descending night. Behind the walls of the houses I passed, the French nation was clearing away the dishes, putting little Jean Pierre and Marie to bed, scowling over the eternal problems of the sou, the shop, the church, the unsteady State. Those walls, those shuttered windows held them in and protected them against the darkness and the long moan of this long night. Ten years hence, little Jean Pierre or Marie might find themselves out here beside the river and wonder, like me, how they had fallen out of the web of safety. What a long way, I thought, I\u2019ve come\u2014to be destroyed!","The conquests of England - every single one of them bloody - are part of what Americans have in mind when they speak of England\u2019s glory. In the United States, violence and heroism have been made synonymous when it comes to Blacks. And the only way to defeat Malcom\u2019s point is to concede and then ask oneself why this is so.","It is really quite impossible to be affirmative about anything which one refuses to question; one is doomed to remain inarticulate about about anything which one hasn\u2019t, by an act of the imagination, made one\u2019s own.","quoted Djuna Barnes: \u201cToo great a sense of identity makes a man feel he can do no wrong. And too little does the same.","The burden of his salvation seemed to be on me and I could not endure it.","One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself\u2014that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving. And, after all, one can give freedom only by setting someone free.","For he was one of those poets who escaped the terrors of writing by writing all the time.","I must believe, I must believe, that the heavy grace of God, which has brought me to this point, is all that can carry me out of it.","It\u2019s funny about people. Just before something happens, you almost know what it is. You do know what it is, I believe. You just haven\u2019t had the time\u2014and now you won\u2019t have the time\u2014to say it to yourself.","How else, then, to explain my every effort to tell in a novel as best I could the stories of slave masters, black and white, and how slavery crushed their souls every morning they got up from their beds and thanked their god for their dominion over others. If I knew the importance of telling that, it was because Baldwin and his kind had planted the idea long ago. (I give him so much credit because he was in the minority of all the black writers I was reading who understood the importance of giving white people their due as full-fledged human beings. Even before I knew I would get into this writing thing, Baldwin told me this: You do not have to fully humanize your black characters by dehumanizing the white ones.)","one day I\'ll weep for this. One of these days I\'ll start to cry.","They preferred the invention because this invention expressed and corroborated their hates and fears so perfectly. It is just as well to remember that people are always doing this. Perhaps many of those legends, including Christianity, to which the world clings began their conquest of the world with just some such concerted surrender to distortion.","No matter how it seems now, I must confess: I loved him. I do not think that I will ever love anyone like that again.","This fatalistic indifference is something that drives the optimistic American liberal quite mad; he is prone, in his more exasperated moments, to refer to Negroes as political children, an appellation not entirely just. Negro liberals, being consulted, assure us that this is something that will disappear with \u201ceducation, a vast, all-purpose term, conjuring up visions of sunlit housing projects, stacks of copybooks and a race of well-soaped, dark-skinned people who never slur their R\u2019s. Actually, this is not so much political irresponsibility as the product of experience, experience which no amount of education can quite efface. It is, as much as anything else, the reason the Negro vote is so easily bought and sold, the reason for that exclamation heard so frequently on Sugar Hill: \u201cOur people never get anywhere.\u201d","Since Negroes have been in this country their one major, devastating gain was their Emancipation, an emancipation no one regards any more as having been dictated by humanitarian impulses.","People pay for what they do, and, still more, for what they have allowed themselves to become. And they pay for it very simply: by the lives they lead. The crucial thing, here, is that the sum of these individual abdications menaces life all over the world. For, in the generality, as social and moral and political and sexual entities, white Americans are probably the sickest and certainly the most dangerous people, of any color, to be found in the world today.","White people were, and are, astounded by the holocaust in Germany. They did not know that they could act that way. But I very much doubt whether black people were astounded - at least, in the same way. For my part, the fate of the Jews, and the world\'s indifference to it, frightened me very much. i could not but feel, in those sorrowful years, that this human indifference, concerning which I knew so much already, would be my portion on the day that the United States decided to murder its Negroes systematically instead of little by little and catch-as-catch-can.","And here I was, left with only myself to deal with. It was entirely up to me.","The blacks have a song which says, \'I can\'t believe what you say, because I see what you do.\' No American film, relating to blacks, can possibly incorporate this observation.","And if one despairs\u2014as who has not?\u2014of human love, God\u2019s love alone is left. But God\u2014and I felt this even then, so long ago, on that tremendous floor, unwillingly\u2014is white. And if His love was so great, and if He loved all His children, why were we, the blacks, cast down so far?","Best advice I ever got was an old friend of mine, a black friend, who said you have to go the way your blood beats. If you don\u2019t live the only life you have, you won\u2019t live some other life, you won\u2019t live any life at all. That\u2019s the only advice you can give anybody. And it\u2019s not advice, it\u2019s an observation.","But the policemen were doing nothing now. Obviously, this was not because they had become more human but because they were under orders and because they were afraid. And indeed they were, and I was delighted to see it. There they stood, in twos and threes and fours, in their Cub Scout uniforms and with their Cub Scout faces, totally unprepared, as is the way with American he-men, for anything that could not be settled with a club or a fist or a gun.","A mob is not autonomous: it executes the real will of the people who rule the State. The slaughter in Birmingham, Alabama, for example, was not merely the action of a mob.","The romance of treason never occurred to us for the brutally simple reason that you can\'t betray a country you don\'t have. (Think about it).","People evolve a language in order to describe and thus control their circumstances, or in order not to be submerged by a reality that they cannot articulate.","This is, perhaps, a very subtle argument, but black men do not have the same reason to hate white men as white men have to hate blacks. The root of the white man\'s hatred is terror, a bottomless and nameless terror, which focuses on the black, surfacing, and concentrating on this dread figure, an entity which lives only in his mind. But the root of the black man\'s hatred is rage, and he does not so much hate white men as simply want them out his way, and, more than that, out of his children\'s way.","NEGROES IN THE NORTH ARE right when they refer to the South as the Old Country. A Negro born in the North who finds himself in the South is in a position similar to that of the son of the Italian emigrant who finds himself in Italy, near the village where his father first saw the light of day. Both are in countries they have never seen, but which they cannot fail to recognize. The landscape has always been familiar; the speech is archaic, but it rings a bell; and so do the ways of the people, though their ways are not his ways. Everywhere he turns, the revenant finds himself reflected. He sees himself as he was before he was born, perhaps; or as the man he would have become, had he actually been born in this place.","It is savagely, if one may say so, ironical that the only proof the world\u2014mankind\u2014has ever had of White supremacy is in the Black face and voice: that face never scrutinized, that voice never heard. The eyes in that face prove the unforgivable and unimaginable horror of being a captive in the promised land, but also prove that trouble don\u2019t last always: and the voice, once filled with a rage and pain that corroborated the reality of the jailer, is addressing another reality, in other tongues. The people who think of themselves as White have the choice of becoming human or irrelevant. Or\u2014as they are, indeed, already, in all but actual fact: obsolete. For, if trouble don\u2019t last always, as the Preacher tells us, neither does Power, and it is on the fact or the hope or the myth of Power that that identity which calls itself White has always seemed to depend.","I really mean that there was no love in the church. It was a mask for hatred and self-hatred and despair.","The world had prepared no place for you, and if the world had its way, no place would ever exist. Now, this is true for everyone, but, in the case of a Negro, this truth is absolutely naked: if he deludes himself about it, he will die. This is not the way this truth presents itself to white men, who believe the world is theirs and who, albeit unconsciously, expect the world to help them in the achievement of their identity.","I felt so aimless\u2015like a tennis ball, bouncing, bouncing\u2015I began to wonder where I\'d land. I began to feel that I\'d, somewhere, missed the boat.\\" She looked at me. \\"You know the boat I\'m talking about. They make movies about it where I come from. It\'s the boat that, when you miss it, it\'s a boat, but when it comes in, it\'s a ship.","It began to seem that one would have to hold in the mind forever two ideas which seemed to be in opposition. The first idea was acceptance, the acceptance, totally without rancor, of life as it is, and men as they are: in the light of this idea, it goes without saying that injustice is a commonplace. But this did not mean that one could be complacent, for the second idea was of equal power: that one must never, in one\u2019s own life, accept these injustices as commonplace but must fight them with all one\u2019s strength. This fight begins, however, in the heart and it now had been laid to my charge to keep my own heart free of hatred and despair. This intimation made my heart heavy and, now that my father was irrecoverable, I wished that he had been beside me so that I could have searched his face for the answers which only the future would give me now.","It\u2019s not really a mystery except it\u2019s always a mystery about people.","And no matter what I was doing, another me sat in my belly, absolutely cold with terror over the question of my life.","Negro actress once observed to me, that not only does the white world impose the most intolerable conditions on Negro life, they also presume to dictate the mode, manner, terms, and style of one\u2019s reaction against these conditions.","One writes out of one thing only\u2014one\u2019s own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give.

I speak of change not on the surface but in the depths\u2014change in the sense of renewal. But renewal becomes impossible if one supposes things to be constant that are not\u2014safety, for example, or money, or power. One clings then to chimeras, by which one can only be betrayed, and the entire hope\u2014the entire possibility\u2014of freedom disappears. And by destruction I mean precisely the abdication by Americans of any effort really to be free. The Negro can precipitate this abdication because white Americans have never, in all their long history, been able to look on him as a man like themselves. This point need not be labored; it is proved over and over again by the Negro\u2019s continuing position here, and his indescribable struggle to defeat the stratagems that white Americans have used, and use, to deny him his humanity. America could have used in other ways the energy that both groups have expended in this conflict. America, of all the Western nations, has been best placed to prove the uselessness and the obsolescence of the concept of color. But it has not","I must\u2014to be honest\u2014add that my ministry almost certainly helped me through my adolescence by giving me something larger than myself to be frightened about.","You are afraid that you have been here with me too long, and are not really white anymore. That\'s probably true, but you were never really white in the first place. Nobody is. Nobody has, even, ever wanted to be white, unless they are afraid of being black. But being black is nothing to be afraid of. I knew that before I met you, and I have learned it again, through you. Perhaps being white is not a conceivable condition, but a terrifying fantasy, a moral choice.","Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.","I suppose this to mean that the song is still needed, still has work to do.","I love America more than any other country in the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.

That\'s how the world gets to be so fucking moral. The only way to know that you are safe is to see somebody else in danger-otherwise you can\'t be sure if you\'re safe.","You must put yourself in the skin of a man who is wearing the uniform of his country, is a candidate for death in its defense, and who is called a \u201cnigger by his comrades-in-arms and his officers; who is almost always given the hardest, ugliest, most menial work to do; who knows that the white G.I. has informed the Europeans that he is subhuman (so much for the American male\u2019s sexual security); who does not dance at the U.S.O. the night white soldiers dance there, and does not drink in the same bars white soldiers drink in; and who watches German prisoners of war being treated by Americans with more human dignity than he has ever received at their hands. And who, at the same time, as a human being, is far freer in a strange land than he has ever been at home. Home! The very word begins to have a despairing and diabolical ring. You must consider what happens to this citizen, after all he has endured, when he returns\u2014home: search, in his shoes, for a job, for a place to live; ride, in his skin, on segregated buses; see, with his eyes, the signs saying \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cColored,\u201d and especially the signs that say \u201cWhite Ladies\u201d and \u201cColored Women\u201d; look into the eyes of his wife; look into the eyes of his son; listen, with his ears, to political speeches, North and South; imagine yourself being told to \u201cwait.\u201d And all this is happening in the richest and freest country in the world, and in the middle of the twentieth century. The subtle and deadly change of heart that might occur in you would be involved with the realization that a civilization is not destroyed by wicked people; it is not necessary that people be wicked but only that they be spineless.\u201d","I had been sent away to help guarantee and perpetuate this indifference. No one, here, knew what was happening anywhere else. Perhaps no one ever knows that, anywhere: wherever \\"here\\" may be, it must always happen \\"here\\" before it can be perceived to have happened. And then, it is not really perceived, it is simply endured. Out of this endurance come, for the most part, alas, monuments, legends, and lies. People cling to these in order to deny that what happened is always happening; that what happened is not an event skewered and immobilized by time, but a continuing and timeless mirror of ourselves.","If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer, and more loving.

Or hadn\'t you heard?","I know, in any case, that the most crucial time in my own development came when I was forced to recognize that I was a kind of a bastard of the West; when I followed the line of my past, I did not find myself in Europe but in Africa. And this meant that in some subtle way, in a really profound way, I brought to Shakespeare, Bach, Rembrandt, to the stones of Paris, to the cathedral at Chartres, and to the Empire State Building, a special attitude. These were not really my creations, they did not contain my history; I might search in them in vain forever for any reflection of myself.","The power to define the other seals one\'s definition of oneself.","Perhaps everybody has a garden of Eden, I don\u2019t know; but they have scarcely seen their garden before they see the flaming sword. Then, perhaps, life only offers the choice of remembering the garden or forgetting it. Either, or: it takes strength to remember, it takes another kind of strength to forget, it takes a hero to do both. People who remember court madness through death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget. Heroes are rare.","If your countrymen think that privacy is a crime, so much the worse for your country.","She moved in a silent ferocity of dignity which barely escaped being ludicrous.","I remembered women I had known, but scarcely looked at, who had frightened me; because they knew how to use their bodies in order to get something that they wanted. I now began to realize that my judgement of these women had very little to do with morals.

I could not conceive of peddling myself for so low a price.","I have never accepted the notion that you keep a Cadillac or a yacht or anything at all, except perhaps for convenience. I have always had a quarrel with this country not only about race but about the standards by which it appears to live. People are drowning in things.

Now as then the buildings are old and in desperate need of repair, the streets are crowded and dirty, there are too many human beings per square block. Rents are 10 to 58 per cent higher than anywhere else in the city; food, expensive everywhere, is more expensive here and of an inferior quality; and now that the war is over and money is dwindling, clothes are carefully shopped for and seldom bought. Negroes, traditionally the last to be hired and the first to be fired, are finding jobs harder to get, and, while prices are rising implacably, wages are going down. All over Harlem now there is felt the same bitter expectancy with which, in my childhood, we awaited winter: it is coming and it will be hard; there is nothing anyone can do about it.","Suddenly, sitting at the window, and with a violence unprecedented, there arose in John a flood of fury and tears, and he bowed his head, fists clenched against the windowpane, crying, with teeth on edge: \\"What shall I do? What shall I do?","The terrible thing about being a Negro leader lies in the term itself. I do not mean merely the somewhat condescending differentiation the term implies, but the nicely refined torture a man can experience from having been created and defeated by the same circumstances. That is, Negro leaders have been created by the American scene, which thereafter works against them at every point; and the best that they can hope for is ultimately to work themselves out of their jobs, to nag contemporary American leaders and the members of their own group until a bad situation becomes so complicated and so bad that it cannot be endured any longer.","The occurrence of an event is not the same thing as knowing what it is that one has lived through. Most people had not lived--nor could it, for that matter, be said that they had died--through any of their terrible events. They had simply been stunned by the hammer. They passed their lives thereafter in a kind of limbo of denied and unexamined pain. The great question that faced him this morning was whether or not he had ever, really, been present at his life. For if he had ever been present, then he was present still, and his world would open up before him.","[...] tenderness so painful I thought my heart would burst.","But I am really saying something very simple. The will of the people, or the state, is revealed by the state\'s institutions. There was not, then, nor is there, now, a single American institution, which is not a racist institution. And racist institutions - the unions, for one example, the Church, for another, and the Army - or the military - for yet another, are meant to keep the nigger in his place. Yes: we have lived through tokens and concessions but white power remains white. And what it appears to surrender with one hand it obsessively clutches in the other.","It had come from nowhere. \u201cWe got stopped by the cops, I said. Then I could not continue. I looked helplessly at Caleb and Caleb told the story. As Caleb spoke, I watched my father\u2019s face. I don\u2019t know how to describe what I saw. I felt the one arm he had around me tighten, tighten; his lips became bitter and his eyes grew dull. It was as though, after indescribable, nearly mortal effort, after grim years of fasting and prayer, after the loss of all he had, and after having been promised by the Almighty that he had paid the price and no more would be demanded of his soul, which was harbored now; it was as though in the midst of his joyful feasting and dancing, crowned and robed, a messenger arrived to tell him that a great error had been made, and that it was all to be done again.\u201d","Giovanni looked at me. And this look made me feel that no one in my life had ever looked at me directly before.","Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u2014like its multitudinous, hard-boiled descendants\u2014is a catalogue of violence. This is explained by the nature of Mrs. Stowe\u2019s subject matter, her laudable determination to flinch from nothing in presenting the complete picture; an explanation which falters only if we pause to ask whether or not her picture is indeed complete; and what constriction or failure of perception forced her to so depend on the description of brutality\u2014unmotivated, senseless\u2014and to leave unanswered and unnoticed the only important question: what it was, after all, that moved her people to such deeds.","...despair, whether or not can be taken home and placed in the family table, must always be respected. Despair can make one monstrous, but it can also make one noble.","Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, then, is activated by what might be called a theological terror, the terror of damnation; and the spirit that breathes in this book, hot, self-righteous, fearful, is not different from that spirit of medieval times which sought to exorcize evil by burning witches; and is not different from that terror which activates a lynch mob.","The situation, therefore, in the colonial countries, is tragic, Cesaire continued. \u201cWherever colonization is a fact the indigenous culture begins to rot. And, among these ruins, something begins to be born which is not a culture but a kind of subculture, a subculture which is condemned to exist on the margin allowed it by European culture. This then becomes the province of a few men, the elite, who find themselves placed in the most artificial conditions, deprived of any revivifying contact with the masses of the people.\u201d","I am what time, circumstance, and history have made of me, certainly, but i am also much more than that. So are we all.","I scarcely know how to describe that room. It became, in a way, every room I had ever been in and every room I find myself in hereafter will remind me of Giovanni\'s room.","The paradox, and a fearful paradox it is, is that the American Negro can have no future anywhere on any continent as long as he is unwilling to accept his past. To accept one\'s past--one\'s history--is not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it. An invented past can never be used; it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought.","O riso e o amor v\xeam do mesmo lugar: mas pouca gente vai l\xe1.","In the culture to be born there will no doubt be old and new elements. How these elements will be mixed is not a question to which any individual can respond. The response must be given by the community. But we can say this: that the response will be given, and not verbally, but in tangible facts, and by action.","Now that his flight was so rigorously approaching its end, a light appeared, a backward light, throwing his terrors into relief. And what were these terrors? They were buried beneath the impossible language of the time, lived underground where nearly all of the time\'s true feeling spitefully and incessantly fermented. Precisely, therefore, to the extent that they were inexpressible, were these terrors mighty; precisely because they lived in the dark were their shapes obscene. And because the taste for obscenity is universal and the appetite for reality rare and hard to cultivate, he had nearly perished in the basement of his private life. Or, more precisely, his fantasies.","For a woman, she said, \u201cI think a man is always a stranger.

But the end of innocence is also the end of guilt.","It is axiomatic that the Negro is religious, which is to say that he stands in fear of the God our ancestors gave us and before whom we all tremble yet. There are probably more churches in Harlem than in any other ghetto in this city and they are going full blast every night and some of them are filled with praying people every day. This, supposedly, exemplifies the Negro\u2019s essential simplicity and good-will; but it is actually a fairly desperate emotional business.","I guess it can\'t be too often that two people can laugh and make love, too, make love because they are laughing, laugh because they\'re making love. The love and the laughter come from the same place: but not many people go there.","To accept one\u2019s past\u2014one\u2019s history\u2014is not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it.

They do not know the precise shape of the future, but they know that the future belongs to them.

If it cannot do that, I do not think the country has a future.","The spreading of the Gospel, regardless of the motives or the integrity or the heroism of some of the missionaries, was an absolutely indispensable justification for the planting of the flag. Priests and nuns and school-teachers helped to protect and sanctify the power that was so ruthlessly being used by people who were indeed seeking a city, but not one in the heavens, and one to be made, very definitely, by captive hands. The Christian church itself\u2014again, as distinguished from some of its ministers\u2014sanctified and rejoiced in the conquests of the flag, and encouraged, if it did not formulate, the belief that conquest, with the resulting relative well-being of the Western populations, was proof of the favor of God.","When a tradition has been evolved, whatever the tradition is, the people, in general, will suppose it to have existed from before the beginning of time and will be most unwilling and indeed unable to conceive of any changes in it. They do not know how they will live without those traditions that have given them their identity. Their reaction, when it is suggested that they can or that they must, is panic. And we see this panic, I think, everywhere in the world today.","Their faith may be described as childlike, but the end it serves is often sinister. It may, indeed, \u201ckeep them happy\u2014a phrase carrying the inescapable inference that the way of life imposed on Negroes makes them quite actively unhappy\u2014but also, and much more significantly, religion operates here as a complete and exquisite fantasy revenge: white people own the earth and commit all manner of abomination and injustice on it; the bad will be punished and the good rewarded, for God is not sleeping, the judgment is not far off. It does not require a spectacular degree of perception to realize that bitterness is here neither dead nor sleeping, and that the white man, believing what he wishes to believe, has misread the symbols. Quite often the Negro preacher descends to levels less abstract and leaves no doubt as to what is on his mind: the pressure of life in Harlem, the conduct of the Italian-Ethiopian war, racial injustice during the recent war, and the terrible possibility of yet another very soon. All these topics provide excellent springboards for sermons thinly coated with spirituality but designed mainly to illustrate the injustice of the white American and\u201d","What it comes to is that if we, who can scarcely be considered a white nation, persist in thinking of ourselves as one, we condemn ourselves, with the truly white nations, to sterility and decay, whereas if we could accept ourselves as we are, we might bring new life to the Western achievements, and transform them. The price of this transformation is the unconditional freedom of the Negro; it is not too much to say that he, who has been so long rejected, must now be embraced, and at no matter what psychic or social risk. He is the key figure in his country, and the American future is precisely as bright or as dark as his. And the Negro recognizes this, in a negative way. Hence the question: Do I really want to be integrated into a burning house?","Thought the death took many forms, though people died early in many different ways, the death itself was very simple and the cause was simple, too: as simple as the plague: the kids had been told that they weren\u2019t worth shit and everything they saw around them proved it. They struggled, they struggled, but they fell, like flies, and they congregated on the garbage heaps of their lives like flies.","It was the Lord who knew of the impossibility every parent in that room faced: how to prepare the child for the day when the child would be despised and how to create in the child - by what means? - a stronger antidote to this poison than one had found for oneself.","It was never the intention of England or France or Portugal, or any of the colonial powers, to raise the colonial people to their level. No matter what they say now about highways and hospitals and penicillin, whatever was done in those colonies was not done for the natives. And the Belgians may not know this, but the natives do. What happened was very simple. You cannot walk into a country and stay there as long as the Europeans did and dig coal and iron and gold out of the earth and use it for yourself. Put all the natives in one place and have them working for you, and have a European sector where only Europeans live. By and by, it\u2019s inevitable that someone will make a connection between the machines you have and the power you have. And from there, it\u2019s just a matter of detail. Now the details can be bloody, or they can be less so; they will in any case be difficult. We in this country now\u2014and it really is one minute to twelve\u2014can really turn the tide because we have an advantage that Europe does not have, and we have an advantage that Africa does not have, if we could face it. Black and white people have lived together here for generations, and now for centuries. Now, on whether or not we face these facts everything depends.

Their apprehension of this history cannot fail to reveal to them that they have been robbed, maligned, and rejected: to bow down before that history is to accept that history\u2019s arrogant and unjust judgment. This is why, ultimately, all attempts at dialogue between the subdued and subduer, between those placed within history and those dispersed outside, break down.","Negroes know how little most white people are prepared to implement their words with deeds, how little, when the chips are down, they are prepared to risk. And this long history of moral evasion has had an unhealthy effect on the total life of the country, and has eroded whatever respect Negroes may once have felt for white people.","In Africa, he said, there was none whatever. Africans do not, in fact, believe that Christianity is any longer real for Europeans, due to the immense scaffolding with which they have covered it, and the fact that this religion has no effect whatever on their conduct.","but the African has not yet endured the utter alienation of himself from his people and his past.

They were attempting to go to school. They were attempting to get an education, in a country in which education is a synonym for indoctrination, if you are white, and subjugation, if you are black. It was rather as though small Jewish boys and girls, in Hitler\u2019s Germany, insisted on getting a German education in order to overthrow the Third Reich. Here they were, nevertheless, scrubbed and shining, in their never-to-be-forgotten stiff little dresses, in their never-to-be-forgotten little blue suits, facing an army, facing a citizenry, facing white fathers, facing white mothers, facing the progeny of these co-citizens, facing the white past, to say nothing of the white present: small soldiers, armed with stiff, white dresses, and long or short dark blue pants, entering a leper colony, and young enough to believe that the colony could be healed, and saved.

What I was learning was beginning to frighten me to death. If you look steadily into that unblinking blue, into that pinpoint at the center of the eye, you discover a bottomless cruelty, a viciousness cold and icy.

That poison becomes your diet\u2014you drink a little of it every day. Once you\u2019ve seen it, you can\u2019t stop seeing it\u2014that\u2019s the trouble. And it can, it can\u201d\u2014she passed her hand wearily over her brow again\u2014\u201cdrive you mad.\u201d","They had the judges, the juries, the shotguns, the law\u2014in a word, power. But it was a criminal power, to be feared but not respected, and to be outwitted in any way whatever.","People are continually pointing out to me the wretchedness of white people in order to console me for the wretchedness of blacks. But an itemized account of the American failure does not console me and it should not console anyone else.","We\'ve got to be as clear-headed about human beings as possible, because we are still each other\'s only hope.","your father or mine, should have told us that not many people have ever died of love. But multitudes have perished, and are perishing every hour\u2014and in the oddest places!\u2014for the lack of it.","The American Negro is a unique creation; he has no counterpart anywhere, and no predecessors. The Muslims react to this fact by referring to the Negro as \u201cthe so-called American Negro and substituting for the names inherited from slavery the letter \u201cX.\u201d It is a fact that every American Negro bears a name that originally belonged to the white man whose chattel he was. I am called Baldwin because I was either sold by my African tribe or kidnapped out of it into the hands of a white Christian named Baldwin, who forced me to kneel at the foot of the cross. I am, then, both visibly and legally the descendant of slaves in a white, Protestant country, and this is what it means to be an American Negro, this is who he is\u2014a kidnapped pagan, who was sold like an animal and treated like one, who was once defined by the American Constitution as \u201cthree-fifths\u201d of a man, and who, according to the Dred Scott decision, had no rights that a white man was bound to respect. And today, a hundred years after his technical emancipation, he remains\u2014with the possible exception of the American Indian\u2014the most despised creature in his country.\u201d","Perhaps we were, all of us -pimps, whores, racketeers, church members, and children -bound together by the nature of our oppression, the specific and peculiar complex of risks we had to run; if so, within these limits we sometimes achieved with each other a freedom that was close to love. I remember, anyway, church suppers and outing, and later, after I left the church, rent and waistline parties where rage and sorrow sat in the darkness and did not stir, and we ate and drank and talked and laughed and danced and forgot all about \\"the man.\\" We had the liquor, we had the chicken, the music, and each other, and had no need to pretend to be what we were not, This is the freedom that one hears in some gospel songs, for example, and in jazz.","I do not mean to be sentimental about suffering\u2014enough is certainly as good as a feast\u2014but people who cannot suffer can never grow up, can never discover who they are.","But that battered word, truth, having made its appearance here, confronts one immediately with a series of riddles and has, moreover, since so many gospels are preached, the unfortunate tendency to make one belligerent.","Any society inevitably produces its criminals, but a society at once rigid and unstable can do nothing whatever to alleviate the poverty of its lowest members, cannot present to the hypothetical young man at the crucial moment that so-well-advertised right path.","You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason. The limits of your ambition were, thus expected to be set forever.... You were not expected to aspire to excellence: you were expected to make peace with mediocrity.","I don\'t think the negro problem can be discussed coherently without bearing in mind its context; its context being the history, traditions, customs, the moral assumptions and preoccupations of the country; in short, the general social fabric. Appearances to the contrary, no one in America escapes its effects and everyone in America bears some responsibility for it. I believe this the more firmly because it is the overwhelming tendency to speak of this problem as if it were a thing apart","And the others, who have avoided all of these deaths, get up in the morning and go downtown to meet \u201cthe man. They work in the white man\u2019s world all day and come home in the evening to this fetid block. They struggle to instill in their children some private sense of honor or dignity which will help the child to survive. This means, of course, that they must struggle, stolidly, incessantly, to keep this sense alive in themselves, in spite of the insults, the indifference, and the cruelty they are certain to encounter in their working day. They patiently browbeat the landlord into fixing the heat, the plaster, the plumbing; this demands prodigious patience; nor is patience usually enough. In trying to make their hovels habitable, they are perpetually throwing good money after bad. Such frustration, so long endured, is driving many strong, admirable men and women whose only crime is color to the very gates of paranoia.\u201d","Because only an artist can tell and only an artist have told, since we have heard of man, what it is like for anyone that gets this planet, to survive it. What it is like to die, or to have somebody die, what it is like to fear death, what is it like to fear, what it is like to love, what it is like to be glad.","Negroes in this country\u2014and Negroes do not, strictly or legally speaking, exist in any other\u2014are taught really to despise themselves from the moment their eyes open on the world. This world is white and they are black. White people hold the power, which means that they are superior to blacks (intrinsically, that is: God decreed it so), and the world has innumerable ways of making this difference known and felt and feared. Long before the Negro child perceives this difference, and even longer before he understands it, he has begun to react to it, he has begun to be controlled by it.","An American Negro, however deep his sympathies, or however bright his rage, ceases to be simply a black man when he faces a black man from Africa. When I say simply a black man, I do not mean that being a black man is simple, anywhere. But I am suggesting that one of the prices an American Negro pays\u2014or can pay\u2014for what is called his \u201cacceptance is a profound, almost ineradicable self-hatred. This corrupts every aspect of his living, he is never at peace again, he is out of touch with himself forever. And, when he faces an African, he is facing the unspeakably dark, guilty, erotic past which the Protestant fathers made him bury\u2014for their peace of mind, and for their power\u2014but which lives in his personality and haunts the universe yet.\u201d","I moved, looking for a cigarette. They were in my hand. I lit one. In a moment, I thought, I will say something. I will say something and then I will walk out of this room forever.","There are so many ways of being despicable it quite makes one\'s head spin. But the way to be really despicable is to be contemptuous of other people\'s pain.","There is no reason for you try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you. The really terrible thing, old buddy, is that you must accept them. And I mean that very seriously. You must accept them and accept them with love. For these innocent people have no other hope. They are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it.","My father\'s attitude was that this was but an inevitable phase of my growing up and he affected to take it lightly. But beneath his jocular, boys-together air, he was at a loss, he was frightened. Perhaps he had supposed that my growing up would bring us closer together\u2014 whereas, now that he was trying to find out something about me, I was in full flight from him. I did not want him to know me. I did not want anyone to know me. And then, again, I was undergoing with my father what the very young inevitably undergo with their elders: I was beginning to judge him. And the very harshness of this judgment, which broke my heart, revealed, though I could not have said it then, how much I had loved him, how that love, along with my innocence, was dying.","I consider that I have many responsibilities, but none greater than this: to last, as Hemingway says, and get my work done. I want to be an honest man and a good writer.","Vivaldo was unlike everyone else that he knew in that they, all the others, could only astonish him by kindness or fidelity; it was only Vivaldo who had the power to astonish him by treachery.","In America, it is true, the appearance is perpetually changing, each generation greeting with short-lived exultation yet more dazzling additions to our renowned fa\xe7ade. But the ghetto, anxiety, bitterness, and guilt continue to breed their indescribable complex of tensions. What time will bring Americans is at last their own identity. It is on this dangerous voyage and in the same boat that the American Negro will make peace with himself and with the voiceless many thousands gone before him.","social affairs are not generally speaking the writer\u2019s prime concern, whether they ought to be or not; it is absolutely necessary that he establish between himself and these affairs a distance which will allow, at least, for clarity, so that before he can look forward in any meaningful sense, he must first be allowed to take a long look back.","This lack of what may roughly be called social paranoia causes the American writer in Europe to feel\u2014almost certainly for the first time in his life\u2014that he can reach out to everyone, that he is accessible to everyone and open to everything. This is an extraordinary feeling. He feels, so to speak, his own weight, his own value.","All cultures have, furthermore, an economic, social, and political base, and no culture can continue to live if its political destiny is not in its own hands. \u201cAny political and social regime which destroys the self-determination of a people also destroys the creative power of that people. When this has happened the culture of that people has been destroyed. And it is simply not true that the colonizers bring to the colonized a new culture to replace the old one, a culture not being something given to a people, but, on the contrary and by definition, something that they make themselves. Nor is it, in any case, in the nature of colonialism to wish or to permit such a degree of well-being among the colonized. The well-being of the colonized is desirable only insofar as this well-being enriches the dominant country, the necessity of which is simply to remain dominant.\u201d","The eyes of his friends told him that he was falling. His own heart told him so. But the air through which he rushed was his prison.","We had our arms around each other. It was like holding in my hand some rare, exhausted, nearly doomed bird which I had miraculously happened to find.","But men have no secrets, except from women, and never grow up in the way that women do. It is very much harder, and it takes much longer, for a man to grow up, and he could never do it at all without women. This is a mystery which can terrify and immobilize a woman, and it is always the key to her deepest distress. She must watch and guide, but he must lead, and he will always appear to be giving far more of his real attention to his comrades than he is giving to her. But that noisy, outward openness of men with each other enables them to deal with the silence and secrecy of women, that silence and secrecy which contains the truth of a man, and releases it. I suppose that the root of the resentment\u2014a resentment which hides a bottomless terror\u2014has to do with the fact that a woman is tremendously controlled by what the man\u2019s imagination makes of her\u2014literally, hour by hour, day by day; so she becomes a woman. But a man exists in his own imagination, and can never be at the mercy of a woman\u2019s.","Every effort made by the child\u2019s elders to prepare him for a fate from which they cannot protect him causes him secretly, in terror, to begin to await, without knowing that he is doing so, his mysterious and inexorable punishment. He must be \u201cgood not only in order to please his parents and not only to avoid being punished by them; behind their authority stands another, nameless and impersonal, infinitely harder to please, and bottomlessly cruel.\u201d","Every man in the chapel hoped that when his hour came he, too, would be eulogized, which is to say forgiven, and that all of his lapses, greeds, errors, and strayings from the truth would be invested with coherence and looked upon with charity. This was perhaps the last thing humans could give each other and it was what they demanded, after all, of the Lord.","the past will remain horrible for exactly as long as we refuse to assess it honestly.","Thursday\u2019s great event was Aim\xe9 Cesaire\u2019s speech in the afternoon, dealing with the relation between colonization and culture.","One writes out of one thing only\u2014one\u2019s own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give. This is the only real concern of the artist, to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art.","And all this is happening in the richest and freest country in the world, and in the middle of the 20th century. The subtle and deadly change of heart that might occur and you would be involved with the realization that a civilization is not destroyed by wicked people; it is not necessary that people be wicked but only that they be spineless.","I was, in short, but one generation removed from the South, which was now undergoing a new convulsion over whether black children had the same rights, or capacities, for education as did the children of white people. This is a criminally frivolous dispute, absolutely unworthy of this nation; and it is being carried on, in complete bad faith, by completely uneducated people. (We do not trust educated people and rarely, alas, produce them, for we do not trust the independence of mind which alone makes a genuine education possible.)","I do a lot of rewriting. It\u2019s very painful.","What the world does to you, if the world does it to you long enough and effectively enough, you begin to do to yourself. You become a collaborator, an accomplice to your own murderers, because you believe the same things they do.","It began to seem that one would have to hold in the mind forever two ides which seemed to be in opposition. The first idea was acceptance, totally without rancor, of life as it is, and men as they are; in the light of this idea it goes without saying that injustice is a commonplace. But this did not mean that one could be complacent, for the second idea was of equal power: that one must never, in one\'s own life, accept these injustices as commonplace but must fight them with all one\'s strength. This fight begins, however, in the heart and it had now been laid to my charge to keep my heart free of hatred and despair. This intimation made my heart heavy, and now that my father was irrecoverable I wished that he had been beside me so that I could have searched his face for the answers which only the future would give me now.","Americans are as unlike any other white people in the world as it is possible to be. I do not think, for example, that it is too much to suggest that the American vision of the world\u2014which allows so little reality, generally speaking, for any of the darker forces in human life, which tends until today to paint moral issues in glaring black and white\u2014owes a great deal to the battle waged by Americans to maintain between themselves and black men a human separation which could not be bridged.","Well isn\'t it true? You don\'t have a home until you leave it and then, when you have left it, you can never go back.\'\'I seem\', I said, \'to have heard this song before.\'\'Ah, yes\', said Giovanni, \'and you will certainly hear it again. It is one of those songs that somebody, somewhere, will always be singing.","The author \\"must destroy our myths and give us back our histories, which will destroy our attitudes and give us back our personalities.","Let us say, then, that truth, as used here, is meant to imply a devotion to the human being, his freedom and fulfillment; freedom which cannot be legislated, fulfillment which cannot be charted.","...American white progress. When one examines the use of this word in the most particular context, it translates as meaning that those people who have opted for being white congratulate themselves on their generous ability to return to the slave that freedom which they never had any right to endanger, much less take away. For this dubious achievement, they congratulate themselves and expect to be congratulated: in the coin, furthermore, of black gratitude, gratitude not only that my burden is being made lighter but my joy that white people are improving.","But it is part of the business of the writer\u2014as I see it\u2014to examine attitudes, to go beneath the surface, to tap the source.","You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason. The limits of your ambition were, thus, expected to be set forever. You were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity, and in as many ways as possible, that you were a worthless human being. You were not expected to aspire to excellence: you were expected to make peace with mediocrity.","I know I can\u2019t help you very much right now\u2014God knows what I wouldn\u2019t give if I could. But I know about suffering; if that helps. I know that it ends.","It is only now beginning to be borne in on us\u2014very faintly, it must be admitted, very slowly, and very much against our will\u2014that this vision of the world is dangerously inaccurate, and perfectly useless. For it protects our moral high-mindedness at the terrible expense of weakening our grasp of reality. People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.","They say the kids are dumb and so they\'re teaching them to work with their hands. Those kids aren\'t dumb. But the people who run these schools want to make sure that they don\'t get smart: they are really teaching the kids to be slaves.","The difficulty then, for me, of being a Negro writer was the fact that I was, in effect, prohibited from examining my own experience too closely by the tremendous demands and the very real dangers of my social situation.","In order to act, you must be somewhat insane. A reasonably sensible man is satisfied with thinking.","I guess it takes a holy man to make a girl a real whore.","was trying to explain to someone else that the situation of the Irish a hundred years ago and the situation of the Negro today cannot very usefully be compared. Negroes were brought here in chains long before the Irish ever thought of leaving Ireland; what manner of consolation is it to be told that emigrants arriving here\u2014voluntarily\u2014long after you did have risen far above you? In","Afro-Americans. Which is but a wedding, however, of two confusions, an arbitrary linking of two undefined and currently undefinable proper nouns. I mean that, in the case of Africa, Africa is still chained to Europe, and exploited by Europe, and Europe and America are chained together; and as long as this is so, it is hard to speak of Africa except as a cradle and a potential. Not until the many millions of people on the continent of Africa control their land and their resources will the African personality flower or genuinely African institutions flourish and reveal Africa as she is.","The distance between us, and I had never thought of this before, was that they did not know this, and I now dared to realize that I loved them more than they loved me. And I do not mean that my love was greater: who dares judge the inexpressible expense another pays for his life? who knows how much one is loved, by whom, or what that love may be called on to do? No, the way the cards had fallen meant that I had to face more about them than they could know about me, knew","If you have been watching television lately, I think this is unendurably clear in the faces of those screaming people in the South, who are quite incapable of telling you what it is they are afraid of. They do not really know what it is they are afraid of, but they know they are afraid of something, and they are so frightened that they are nearly out of their minds. And this same fear obtains on one level or another, to varying degrees, throughout the entire country. We would never, never allow Negroes to starve, to grow bitter, and to die in ghettos all over the country if we were not driven by some nameless fear that has nothing to do with Negroes. We would never victimize, as we do, children whose only crime is color and keep them, as we put it, in their place. We wouldn\u2019t drive Negroes mad as we do by accepting them in ball parks, and on concert stages, but not in our homes and not in our neighborhoods, and not in our churches. It is only too clear that even with the most malevolent will in the world Negroes can never manage to achieve one-tenth of the harm which we fear.","I realized that the Bible had been written by white men. I knew that, according to many Christians, I was a descendant of Ham, who had been cursed, and that I was therefore predestined to be a slave. This had nothing to do with anything I was, or contained, or could become; my fate had been sealed forever, from the beginning of time. And it seemed, indeed, when one looked out over Christendom, that this was what Christendom effectively believed.","Then the door is before him. There is darkness all around him, there is silence in him. Then the door opens and he stands alone, the whole world falling away from him. And the brief corner of the sky seems to be shrieking, though he does not hear a sound. Then the earth tilts, he is thrown forward on his face in darkness, and his journey begins.","It will be a great day for America, incidentally, when we begin to eat bread again, instead of the blasphemous and tasteless foam rubber that we have substituted for it.","On the contrary, we have a very deep-seated distrust of real intellectual effort (probably because we suspect that it will destroy, as I hope it does, that myth of America to which we cling so desperately).","\u039f\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf,\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b8\u03c9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03ac\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2.\u039f\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03be\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1,\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b8\u03c9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2.","In the first place, as the homeless wanderers of the twentieth century prove, the question of nationality no longer necessarily involves the question of allegiance. Allegiance, after all, has to work two ways; and one can grow weary of an allegiance which is not reciprocal.","It is savagely, if one may say so, ironical that the only proof the world -- mankind -- has ever had of White supremacy is in the Black face and voice: that face never scrutinized, that voice never heard. The eyes in that face prove the unforgivable and unimaginable horror of being a captive in the promised land, but also prove that trouble don\'t last always: and the voice, once filled with a rage and pain that corroborated the reality of the jailer, is addressing another reality, in other tongues.","...I think that the past is all that makes the present coherent, and further, that the past will remain horrible for exactly as long as we refuse to assess it honestly.","There are tears on his face, his face or mine, I don\'t know.

People, I felt, ought to love the Lord because they loved Him, and not because they were afraid of going to Hell.","And what the white students had not expected to let themselves in for, when boarding the Freedom Train, was the realisation that the black situation in America was but one aspect of the fraudulent nature of American life. They had not expected to be forced to judge their parents, their elders, and their antecedents, so harshly, and they had not realised how cheaply, after all, the rulers of the republic held their white lives to be. Coming to the defence of the rejected and the destitute, they were confronted with the extent of their own alienation, and the unimaginable dimensions of their own poverty. They were privileged and secure only so long as they did, in effect, what they were told: but they had been raised to believe that they were free.","This is why the most dangerous creation of any society is that man who has nothing to lose.

Yet people remain people, on crutches or indeed on deathbeds....","Perhaps such secrets, the secrets of everyone, were only expressed when the person laboriously ragged them into the light of the world, imposed them on the world, and made them a part of the world\'s experience.

But, finally, as it seems to me, what the rejected desire is, is an elevation of status, acceptance within the present community. Thus, the African, exile, pagan, hurried off the auction block and into the fields, fell on his knees before that God in Whom he must now believe; who had made him, but not in His image.","Faulkner\u2014among so many others!\u2014is so plaintive concerning this \u201cmiddle of the road from which \u201cextremist\u201d elements of both races are driving him that it does not seem unfair to ask just what he has been doing there until now. Where is the evidence of the struggle he has been carrying on there on behalf of the Negro? Why, if he and his enlightened confreres in the South have been boring from within to destroy segregation, do they react with such panic when the walls show any signs of falling? Why\u2014and how\u2014does one move from the middle of the road where one was aiding Negroes into the streets\u2014to shoot them?\u201d","You go to white movies and, like everybody else, you fall in love with Joan Crawford, and you root for the Good Guys who are killing off the Indians. It comes as a great psychological collision when you realize all of these things are really metaphors for your oppression, and will lead into a kind of psychological warfare in which you may perish.","The rage of the disesteemed is personally fruitless, but it is also so absolutely inevitable; this rage, so generally discounted, so little understood even among the people whose daily bread it is, is one of the things that makes history. Rage can only with difficulty, and never entirely, be brought under the domination of the intelligence and is therefore not susceptible to any arguments whatever.","I saw the Negro schools in Charlotte, saw, on street corners, several of their alumnae, and read about others who had been sentenced to the chain gang. This solved the mystery of just what made Negro parents send their children out to face mobs. White people do not understand this because they do not know, and do not want to know, that the alternative to this ordeal is nothing less than a lifelong ordeal. Those Negro parents who spend their days trembling for their children and the rest of their time praying that their children have not been too badly damaged inside, are not doing this out of \u201cideals or \u201cconvictions\u201d or because they are in the grip of a perverse desire to send their children where \u201cthey are not wanted.\u201d They are doing it because they want the child to receive the education which will allow him to defeat, possibly escape, and not impossibly help one day abolish the stifling environment in which they see, daily, so many children perish.\u201d","[T]hese men are your brothers - your lost, younger brothers. And if the word integration means anything, this is what it means: that we, with love, shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it. For this is your home, my friend, do not be driven from it; great men have done great things here, and will again, and we can make America what America must become.","People always seem to band together in accordance to a principle that has nothing to do with love, a principle that releases them from personal responsibility.","Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death\u2014ought to decide, indeed, to earn one\u2019s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible to life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return. One","This helplessness and this gnawing uneasiness does something, at length, to even the toughest mind. Perhaps the best way to sum all this up is to say that the people I knew felt, mainly, a peculiar kind of relief when they knew that their boys were being shipped out of the south, to do battle overseas. It was, perhaps, like feeling that the most dangerous part of a dangerous journey had been passed and that now, even if death should come, it would come with honor and without the complicity of their countrymen. Such a death would be, in short, a fact with which one could hope to live.","The Negroes in Harlem, who have no money, spend what they have on such gimcracks as they are sold. These include \u201cwider TV screens, more \u201cfaithful\u201d hi-fi sets, more \u201cpowerful\u201d cars, all of which, of course, are obsolete long before they are paid for. Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor; and if one is a member of a captive population, economically speaking, one\u2019s feet have simply been placed on the treadmill forever.\u201d","On this particular night, we were free and we had decided to treat ourselves to a really fancy, friendly dinner. There we were, at the table, all dressed up, and we\u2019d ordered everything, and we were having a very nice time with each other. The headwaiter came, and said there was a phone call for me, and Gloria rose to take it. She was very strange when she came back\u2014she didn\u2019t say anything, and I began to be afraid to ask her anything. Then, nibbling at something she obviously wasn\u2019t tasting, she said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to tell you because the press is on its way over here. They\u2019ve just killed Malcolm X. The British press said that I accused innocent people of this murder. What I tried to say then, and will try to repeat now, is that whatever hand pulled the trigger did not buy the bullet. That bullet was forged in the crucible of the West, that death was dictated by the most successful conspiracy in the history of the world, and its name is white supremacy.\u201d","We take our shape within and against that cage of reality bequeathed us at our birth.","You know, and I know, that the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too soon.","The people who have managed to get off this block have only got as far as a more respectable ghetto. This respectable ghetto does not even have the advantages of the disreputable one\u2014friends, neighbors, a familiar church, and friendly tradesmen; and it is not, moreover, in the nature of any ghetto to remain respectable long. Every Sunday, people who have left the block take the lonely ride back, dragging their increasingly discontented children with them. They spend the day talking, not always with words, about the trouble they\u2019ve seen and the trouble\u2014one must watch their eyes as they watch their children\u2014they are only too likely to see. For children do not like ghettos. It takes them nearly no time to discover exactly why they are there.","This war between the Southern cities and states is of the utmost importance, not only for the South, but for the nation. The Southern states are still very largely governed by people whose political lives, insofar, at least, as they are able to conceive of life or politics, are dependent on the people in the rural regions. It might, indeed, be more honorable to try to guide these people out of their pain and ignorance instead of locking them within it, and battening on it; but it is, admittedly, a difficult task to try to tell people the truth and it is clear that most Southern politicians have no intention of attempting it.","Richard and I seemed really to be at the end of our rope, for he had done what he could for me, and it had not worked out, and now he was going away. It seemed to me that he was sailing into the most splendid of futures, for he was going, of all places! to France, and he had been invited there by the French government. But Richard did not seem, though he was jaunty, to be overjoyed. There was a striking sobriety in his face that day. He talked a great deal about a friend of his, who was in trouble with the U.S. Immigration authorities, and was about to be, or already had been, deported. Richard was not being deported, of course, he was traveling to a foreign country as an honored guest; and he was vain enough and young enough and vivid enough to find this very pleasing and exciting. Yet he knew a great deal about exile, all artists do, especially American artists, especially American Negro artists. He had endured already, liberals and literary critics to the contrary, a long exile in his own country. He must have wondered what the real thing would be like. And he must have wondered, too, what would be the unimaginable effect on his daughter, who could now be raised in a country which would not penalize her on account of her color. And that day was very nearly the last time Richard and I spoke to each other without the later, terrible warfare. Two years later, I, too, quit America, never intending to return.","The germ of the dilemma\u2026is trapped in the room with me, always has been, and always will be, and it is yet more foreign to me than those foreign hills outside.","For this village, even were it incomparably more remote and incredibly more primitive, is the West, the West onto which I have been so strangely grafted. These people cannot be, from the point of view of power, strangers anywhere in the world; they have made the modern world, in effect, even if they do not know it. The most illiterate among them is related, in a way that I am not, to Dante, Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Aeschylus, Da Vinci, Rembrandt, and Racine; the cathedral at Chartres says something to them which it cannot say to me, as indeed would New York\u2019s Empire State Building, should anyone here ever see it. Out of their hymns and dances come Beethoven and Bach. Go back a few centuries and they are in their full glory\u2014but I am in Africa, watching the conquerors arrive.","Souvenez vous,\\" she tells me. \\"One must make a little prayer from time to time.","He was suggesting that all Negroes were held in a state of supreme tension between the difficult, dangerous relationship in which they stood to the white world and the relationship, not a whit less painful or dangerous, in which they stood to each other.","It will all be the same, only I will be stiller.","Negroes are Americans and their destiny is the country\u2019s destiny. They have no other experience besides their experience on this continent and it is an experience which cannot be rejected, which yet remains to be embraced. If, as I believe, no American Negro exists who does not have his private Bigger Thomas living in the skull, then what most significantly fails to be illuminated here is the paradoxical adjustment which is perpetually made, the Negro being compelled to accept the fact that this dark and dangerous and unloved stranger is part of himself forever. Only this recognition sets him in any wise free and it is this, this necessary ability to contain and even, in the most honorable sense of the word, to exploit the \u201cnigger, which lends to Negro life its high element of the ironic and which causes the most well-meaning of their American critics to make such exhilarating errors when attempting to understand them.\u201d","But, in the end, it is the threat of universal extinction hanging over all the world today that changes, totally and forever, the nature of reality and brings into devastating question the true meaning of man\u2019s history. We human beings now have the power to exterminate ourselves; this seems to be the entire sum of our achievement.","The trouble with a secret life is that it is very frequently a secret from the person who lives it and not at all a secret for the people he encounters.","She cannot decide whether to wear her hat, or not. Her problem is both trivial and serious, but she has never had to confront it before. Her problem is that she does not look her age. She takes her hat off. She puts it back on. Does the hat make her look younger, or older? At home, she looks her age (whatever that age is) because everybody knows her age. She looks her age because she knows her role. But, now, she is about to enter a nightclub, in a strange town, for the first time in twenty years, alone. She puts the hat on. She takes it off. She realizes that panic is about to overtake her, and so she throws the hat onto the night table, scrubs her face in cold water as harshly as she once scrubbed mine, puts on a high-necked white blouse and a black skin and black high-heeled shoes, pulls her hair cruelly back from her forehead, knots it, and throws a black shawl over her head and shoulders. The intention of all this is to make her look elderly. The effect is to make her look juvenile.","The projects are hideous, of course, there being a law, apparently respected throughout the world, that popular housing shall be as cheerless as a prison. They are lumped all over Harlem, colorless, bleak, high, and revolting. The wide windows look out on Harlem\u2019s invincible and indescribable squalor: the Park Avenue railroad tracks, around which, about forty years ago, the present dark community began; the unrehabilitated houses, bowed down, it would seem, under the great weight of frustration and bitterness they contain; the dark, the ominous schoolhouses from which the child may emerge maimed, blinded, hooked, or enraged for life; and the churches, churches, block upon block of churches, niched in the walls like cannon in the walls of a fortress.","This is the message that has spread through streets and tenements and prisons, through the narcotics wards, and past the filth and sadism of mental hospitals to a people from whom everything has been taken away, including, most crucially, their sense of their own worth. People cannot live without this sense; they will do anything whatever to regain it. This is why the most dangerous creation of any society is that man who has nothing to lose.","It was the Lord who knew of the impossibility every parent in that room faced: how to prepare the child for the day when the child would be despised and how to create in the child\u2014by what means?\u2014a stronger antidote to this poison than one had found for oneself. The avenues, side streets, bars, billiard halls, hospitals, police stations, and even the playgrounds of Harlem\u2014not to mention the houses of correction, the jails, and the morgue\u2014testified to the potency of the poison while remaining silent as to the efficacy of whatever antidote, irresistibly raising the question of whether or not such an antidote existed; raising, which was worse, the question of whether or not an antidote was desirable; perhaps poison should be fought with poison. With these several schisms in the mind and with more terrors in the heart than could be named, it was better not to judge the man who had gone down under an impossible burden. It was better to remember: Thou knowest this man\u2019s fall; but thou knowest not his wrassling.","It seems to be typical of life in America, where opportunities, real and fancied, are thicker than anywhere else on the globe, that the second generation has no time to talk to the first.","It\u2019s a white boy who\u2019s been to a law school and he got them degrees. Well, you know. I ain\u2019t got to tell you what that means: it don\u2019t mean shit.","The people in Harlem know they are living there because white people do not think they are good enough to live anywhere else. No amount of \u201cimprovement can sweeten this fact. Whatever money is now being earmarked to improve this, or any other ghetto, might as well be burnt. A ghetto can be improved in one way only: out of existence.\u201d","In a moment someone will get up and turn on the light. Then the old folks will remember the children and they won\u2019t talk anymore that day. And when light fills the room, the child is filled with darkness. He knows that every time this happens he\u2019s moved just a little closer to that darkness outside. The darkness outside is what the old folks have been talking about. It\u2019s what they\u2019ve come from. It\u2019s what they endure. The child knows that they won\u2019t talk any more because if he knows too much about what\u2019s happened to them, he\u2019ll know too much too soon, about what\u2019s going to happen to him.","She knew through what fires the soul must crawl, and with what weeping one passed over. Men spoke of how the heart broke up, but never spoke of how the soul hung speechless in the pause, the void, the terror between the living and the dead; how, all garments rent and cast aside, the naked soul passed over the very mouth of Hell. Once there, there was no turning back; once there, the soul remembered, though the heart sometimes forgot. For the world called to the heart, which stammered to reply; life, and love, and revelry, and most falsely, hope, called the forgetful, the human heart. Only the soul, obsessed with the journey it had made, and had still to make, pursued its mysterious and dreadful end; and carried heavy with weeping and bitterness the heart along.","A great deal of what I say just leaves me open, I suppose, to a vast amount of misunderstanding. A great deal of what I say is based on an assumption which I hold and don\u2019t always state. You know my fury about people is based precisely on the fact that I consider them to be responsible, moral creatures who so often do not act that way. But I am not surprised when they do. I am not that wretched a pessimist, and I wouldn\u2019t sound the way I sound if I did not expect what I expect from human beings, if I didn\u2019t have some ultimate faith and love, faith in them and love for them. You see, I am a human being too, and I have no right to stand in judgment of the world as though I am not a part of it. What I am demanding of other people is what I am demanding of myself.","Negroes want to be treated like men: a perfectly straightforward statement, containing only seven words. People who have mastered Kant, Hegel, Shakespeare, Marx, Freud, and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable. The idea seems to threaten profound, barely conscious assumptions. A kind of panic paralyzes their features, as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place.","I do not think, if one is a writer, that one escapes it by trying to become something else. One does not become something else: one becomes nothing. And what is crucial here is that the writer, however unwillingly, always, somewhere, knows this. There is no structure he can build strong enough to keep out this self-knowledge. What has happened, however, time and time again, is that the fantasy structure the writer builds in order to escape his central responsibility operates not as his fortress, but his prison, and he perishes within it. Or: the structure he has built becomes so stifling, so lonely, so false, and acquires such a violent and dangerous life of its own, that he can break out of it only by bringing the entire structure down. With a great crash, inevitably, and on his own head, and on the heads of those closest to him.","I don\u2019t like people who like me because I\u2019m a Negro; neither do I like people who find in the same accident grounds for contempt.","Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within. I use the word \u201clove here not merely in the personal sense but as a state of being, or a state of grace\u2014not in the infantile American sense of being made happy but in the tough and universal sense of quest and daring and growth.\u201d","A story is impelled by the necessity to reveal: the aim of the story is revelation, which means that a story can have nothing\u2014at least not deliberately\u2014to hide. This also means that a story resolves nothing. The resolution of a story must occur in us, with what we make of the questions with which the story leaves us. A plot, on the other hand, must come to a resolution, prove a point: a plot must answer all the questions which it pretends to pose.","but what men imagine they are doing and what they are doing in fact are rarely the same thing.","His face was bigger than the world, his eyes deeper than the sun, more vast than the desert, all that had ever happened since time began was in his face.","I wanted to say so many things. Yet when I opened my mouth, I made no sound. And yet - I do not know what I felt for Giovanni. I felt nothing for Giovanni, I felt terror and pity and a rising lust.","sin is the only heritage of the natural man","Both clung to a fantasy rather than to each other, tried to suck pleasure from the crannies of the mind, rather than surrender the secrets of the body.","civilization is not destroyed by wicked people; it is not necessary that people be wicked but only that they be spineless.","Isn\'t love more important than colour?","Negroes who were neither doltish nor servile did not feel that they were doing anything wrong when they robbed white people. In spite of the Puritan-Yankee equation of virtue with well-being, Negroes had excellent reasons for doubting that money was made or kept by any very striking adherence to the Christian virtues; it certainly did not work that way for black Christians. In any case, white people, who had robbed black people of their liberty and who profited by this theft every hour that they lived, had no moral ground on which to stand. They had the judges, the juries, the shotguns, the law\u2014in a word, power. But it was a criminal power, to be feared but not respected, and to be outwitted in any way whatever. And those virtues preached but not practiced by the white world were merely another means of holding Negroes in subjection.","I think she\'s a beautiful woman. She may not be beautiful to look at whatever the fuck that means, in this kingdom of the blind.","The aim of the dreamer, after all, is merely to go on dreaming and not be molested by the world. His dreams are his protection against the world. But the aims of life are antithetical to those of the dreamer, and the teeth of the world are sharp.","Ages ago, in another city, on another bus, I sat so at the windows, looking outward, inventing for each flying face which trapped my brief attention some life, some destiny, in which I played a part. I was looking for some whisper, or promise, of my possible salvation. But it seemed to me that morning that my ancient self had been dreaming the most dangerous dream of all.","He was suggesting that all Negroes were held in a state of supreme tension between the difficult, dangerous relationship in which they stood to the white world and the relationship, not a whit less painful or dangerous, in which they stood to each other. He was suggesting that in the acceptance of this duality lay their strength, that in this, precisely, lay their means of defining and controlling the world in which they lived.","When my fingers began, involuntarily, to loose their hold on Hella, I realized that I was dangling from a high place and that I had been clinging to her for my very life. With each moment, as my fingers slipped, I felt the roaring air beneath me and felt everything in me bitterly contracting, crawling furiously upward against that long fall.","Now Fonny knows hy he is here - why he is where he is; now, he dares to look around him. He is not here for anything he has done. He has always known that, but now he knows it with a difference. At meals, in the showers, up and down the stairs, in the evening, just before everyone is locked in again, he looks at the others, he listens: what have they done? Not much. To do much is to have the power to place these people where they are, and keep them where they are.

But people who were not superior were, nevertheless, extremely lonely\u2014and unable to break out of their solitude precisely because they had no equipment with which to enter it. His own loneliness, magnified so many million times, made the night air colder. He remembered to what excesses, into what traps and nightmares, his loneliness had driven him; and he wondered where such a violent emptiness might drive an entire city.","In all jazz, and especially the blues, there is something tart and ironic, authoritative and double-edged. White Americans seem to feel that happy songs are happy and sad songs are sad, and that, God help us, is exactly the way most white Americans sing them\u2014sounding, in both cases, so helplessly, defenselessly fatuous that one dare not speculate on the temperature of the deep freeze from which issue their brave and sexless little voices. Only people who have been \u201cdown the line, as the song puts it, know what this music is about\u2026. White Americans do not understand the depths out of which such an ironic tenacity comes, but they suspect that the force is sensual, and they are terrified of sensuality, and do not any longer understand it. The word \u201csensual\u201d is not intended to bring to mind quivering dusky maidens or priapic black studs. I am referring to something much simpler and much less fanciful. To be sensual, I think, is to respect and rejoice in the force of life, of life itself, and to be present in all that one does, from the effort of loving to the breaking of bread. It will be a great day for America, incidentally, when we begin to eat bread again, instead of the blasphemous and tasteless foam rubber that we have substituted for it. And I am not being frivolous here, either.\u201d","She sensed that what her aunt spoke of as love was something else\u2014a bribe, a threat, an indecent will to power. She knew that the kind of imprisonment that love might impose was also, mysteriously, a freedom for the soul and spirit, was water in the dry place, and had nothing to do with the prisons, churches, laws, rewards, and punishments, that so positively cluttered the landscape of her aunt\u2019s mind.","One day, Richard would turn to me, with the light of sudden understanding on his face, and say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what you mean.

But the question of sexual dominance can exist only in the nightmare of that soul which has armed itself, totally, against the possibility of the changing motion of conquest and surrender, which is love.","John looked with a child\u2019s impenetrable gravity into the preacher\u2019s face, as though he were turning this question over in his mind and would answer when he had thought it","One day, Richard would turn to me, with the light of sudden understanding on his face, and say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what you mean.

The higher he rises, the less is his journey worth, since (unless he is extremely energetic and anarchic, a genuinely \u201cbad nigger\u201d in the most positive sense of the term) all he can possibly find himself exposed to is the grim emptiness of the white world\u2014which does not live by the standards it uses to victimize him\u2014and the even more ghastly emptiness of black people who wish they were white. Therefore, one \u201cexceptional\u201d Negro watches another \u201cexceptional\u201d Negro in order to find out if he knows how vastly successful and bitterly funny the hoax has been. Alliances, in the great cocktail party of the white man\u2019s world, are formed, almost purely, on this basis, for if both of you can laugh, you have a lot to laugh about.

And I resented this: resented being called an American (and resented resenting it) because it seemed to make me nothing more than that, whatever that was; and I resented being called not an American because it seemed to make me nothing.\u201d","Lord, when you send the rain think about it, please, a little? Do not get carried away by the sound of falling water, the marvelous light on the falling water. I am beneath that water. It falls with great force and the lightBlinds me to the light.","That this is not likely to happen is due to a great many reasons, most hidden and powerful among them the Negro\u2019s real relation to the white American. This relation prohibits, simply, anything as uncomplicated and satisfactory as pure hatred. In order really to hate white people, one has to blot so much out of the mind\u2014and the heart\u2014that this hatred itself becomes an exhausting and self-destructive pose. But this does not mean, on the other hand, that love comes easily: the white world is too powerful, too complacent, too ready with gratuitous humiliation, and, above all, too ignorant and too innocent for that. One is absolutely forced to make perpetual qualifications and one\u2019s own reactions are always canceling each other out. It is this, really, which has driven so many people mad, both white and black. One is always in the position of having to decide between amputation and gangrene. Amputation is swift but time may prove that the amputation was not necessary\u2014or one may delay the amputation too long. Gangrene is slow, but it is impossible to be sure that one is reading one\u2019s symptoms right. The idea of going through life as a cripple is more than one can bear, and equally unbearable is the risk of swelling up slowly, in agony, with poison. And the trouble, finally, is that the risks are real even if the choices do not exist.","Where I was in the world. I mean, what I\u2019m made of. Anyway, Giovanni\u2019s Room is not really about homosexuality. It\u2019s the vehicle through which the book moves. Go Tell It on the Mountain, for example, is not about a church, and Giovanni is not really about homosexuality. It\u2019s about what happens to you if you\u2019re afraid to love anybody. Which is much more interesting than the question of homosexuality.","Giovanni smiled his humble, grateful smile and told me in as many ways as he could find how wonderful it was to have me there, how I stood, with my love and my ingenuity, between him and the dark. Each day he invited me to witness how he had changed, how love had changed him, how he worked and sang and cherished me. I was in a terrible confusion. Sometimes I thought, but this is your life. Stop fighting it. Stop fighting. Or I thought, but I am happy, And he loves me. I am safe. Sometimes, when he was not near me, I thought, I will never let him touch me again. Then, when he touched me, I thought it doesn\'t matter, it is only the body, it will soon be over. When it was over I lay in the dark and listen to his breathing and dreamed of the touch of hands, of Giovanni\'s hands, or anybody\'s hands, hands which would have the power to crash me and make me whole again.","Yes, it does indeed mean something\u2014something unspeakable\u2014to be born, in a white country, an Anglo-Teutonic, antisexual country, black. You very soon, without knowing it, give up all hope of communion. Black people, mainly, look down or look up but do not look at each other, not at you, and white people, mainly, look away.","Finally, we are confronted with the psychology and tradition of the country; if the Negro vote is so easily bought and sold, it is because it has been treated with so little respect; since no Negro dares seriously assume that any politician is concerned with the fate of Negroes, or would do much about it if he had the power, the vote must be bartered for what it will get, for whatever short-term goals can be managed. These goals are mainly economic and frequently personal, sometimes pathetic: bread or a new roof or five dollars, or, continuing up the scale, schools, houses or more Negroes in hitherto Caucasian jobs. The American commonwealth chooses to overlook what Negroes are never able to forget: they are not really considered a part of it. Like Aziz in A Passage to India or Topsy in Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, they know that white people, whatever their love for justice, have no love for them.","The people did not go away, of course; once a people arise, they never go away (a fact which should be included in the Marine handbook).","Privately, we cannot stand our lives and dare not examine them; domestically, we take no responsibility for (and no pride in) what goes on in our country; and internationally, for millions of people, we are an unmitigated disaster.","It is a terrible thing, simply, to be trapped in one\'s history, and attempt, in the same motion (and in this, our life!) to accept, deny, reject, and redeem it--and, also, on whatever level, to profit from it.","I suppose this is why I asked her to marry me: to give me something to be moored to. Perhaps this was why, in Spain, she decided that she wanted to marry me. But people can\'t, unhappily, invent their mooring posts, their lovers and their friends, anymore than they can invent their parents. Life gives these and also takes them away and the great difficulty is to say Yes to life.","He wasn\'t anybody\'s n*****. And that\'s a crime, in this fucking free country. You\'re suppose to be somebody\'s n*****.

So they blew what everyone had heard before, they reassured everyone that nothing terrible was happening, and the people at the tables found it pleasant to shout over this stunning corroboration and the people at the bar, under cover of the noise they could scarcely have lived without, pursued whatever it was they were after.","I love America more than any other country in the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually. I think all theories are suspect, that the finest principles may have to be modified, or may even be pulverized by the demands of life, and that one must find, therefore, one\u2019s own moral center and move through the world hoping that this center will guide one aright.","anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.","People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster. The","In America, though, life seems to move faster than anywhere else on the globe and each generation is promised more than it will get: which creates, in each generation, a furious, bewildered rage, the rage of people who cannot find solid ground beneath their feet.","Up to today we are set at a division, so that he may not marry our daughters or our sisters, nor may he\u2014for the most part\u2014eat at our tables or live in our houses. Moreover, those who do, do so at the grave expense of a double alienation: from their own people, whose fabled attributes they must either deny or, worse, cheapen and bring to market; from us, for we require of them, when we accept them, that they at once cease to be Negroes and yet not fail to remember what being a Negro means\u2014to remember, that is, what it means to us.","Malcolm considered himself to be the spiritual property of the people who produced him. He did not consider himself to be their saviour, he was far too modest for that, and gave that role to another; but he considered himself to be their servant and in order not to betray that trust, he was willing to die, and died. Malcolm was not a racist, not even when he thought he was. His intelligence was more complex than that; furthermore, if he had been a racist, not many in this racist country would have considered him dangerous. He would have sounded familiar and even comforting, his familiar rage confirming the reality of white power and sensuously inflaming a bizarre species of guilty eroticism without which, I am beginning to believe, most white Americans of the more or less liberal persuasion cannot draw a single breath.","Any upheaval in the universe is terrifying because it so profoundly attacks one\u2019s sense of one\u2019s own reality. Well, the black man has functioned in the white man\u2019s world as a fixed star, as an immovable pillar: and as he moves out of his place, heaven and earth are shaken to their foundations. You, don\u2019t be afraid.","Our dehumanization of the Negro then is indivisible from our dehumanization of ourselves: the loss of our own identity is the price we pay for our annulment of his.","The moral of the story (and the hope of the world) lies in what one demands, not of others, but of oneself.","This laughter is the laughter of those who consider themselves to be at a safe remove from all the wretched, for whom the pain of living is not real. ... this laughter is universal and never can be stilled.","This illusion owes everything to the great American illusion that our state is a state to be envied by other people: we are powerful, and we are rich. But our power makes us uncomfortable and we handle it very ineptly. The principal effect of our material well-being has been to set the children\u2019s teeth on edge. If we ourselves were not so fond of this illusion, we might understand ourselves and other peoples better than we do, and be enabled to help them understand us. I am very often tempted to believe that this illusion is all that is left of the great dream that was to have become America; whether this is so or not, this illusion certainly prevents us from making America what we say we want it to be.","But this is not the story which Native Son tells, for we find here merely, repeated in anger, the story which we have told in pride. Nor, since the implications of this anger are evaded, are we ever confronted with the actual or potential significance of our pride; which is why we fall, with such a positive glow of recognition, upon Max\u2019s long and bitter summing up.","Perhaps the best way to sum all this up is to say that the people I knew felt, mainly, a peculiar kind of relief when they knew that their boys were being shipped out of the south, to do battle overseas. It was, perhaps, like feeling that the most dangerous part of a dangerous journey had been passed and that now, even if death should come, it would come with honor and without the complicity of their countrymen. Such a death would be, in short, a fact with which one could hope to live.","It is not Bigger whom we fear, since his appearance among us makes our victory certain. It is the others, who smile, who go to church, who give no cause for complaint, whom we sometimes consider with amusement, with pity, even with affection\u2014and in whose faces we sometimes surprise the merest arrogant hint of hatred, the faintest, withdrawn, speculative shadow of contempt\u2014who make us uneasy; whom we cajole, threaten, flatter, fear; who to us remain unknown, though we are not (we feel with both relief and hostility and with bottomless confusion) unknown to them. It is out of our reaction to these hewers of wood and drawers of water that our image of Bigger was created.","The distance between oneself\u2014the audience\u2014and a screen performer is anabsolute: a paradoxical absolute, masquerading as intimacy.","People are not, for example, terribly anxious to be equal (equal, after all, to what and to whom?) but they love the idea of being superior","Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time.

These have been dealt with, when they have been dealt with at all, out of necessity - and in political terms, anyway, necessity means concessions made in order to stay on top. I think this is a fact, which is serves no purpose to deny, but, whether it is a fact or not, this is what the black population of the world, including black Americans, really believe. The word \u2018independence\u2019 in Africa and the word \u2018integration\u2019 here are almost equally meaningless; that is, Europe has not yet left Africa, and black men here are not yet free.","But you can make your time together anything but dirty, you can give each other something which will make both of you better\u2014forever\u2014if you will not be ashamed, if you will only not play it safe.","Tell me,\u2019 he said, \u2018what is this thing about time?

My executioners are here with me, walking up and down with me, washing things, and packing and drinking from my bottle.","The people who run the mass media and those who consume it are really in the same boat. They must continue to produce things they do not really admire, still less love, in order to continue buying things they do not really want, still less need. If we were dealing only with fintails, two-tone cars, or programs like Gunsmoke, the situation would not be so grave. The trouble is that serious things are handled (and received) with the same essential lack of seriousness.","Eu certamente n\xe3o conseguiria \u2014 naquele momento da minha vida \u2014 lidar com outro grande peso, o \u2018problema do negro\u2019.

(From \\"The Fure Next Time\\")","For the first time in her life she hated it all. The white city. The white world. She could not that day think of one decent white person in the whole world. She sat there and she hoped that one day God with tortures inconceivable would grind them utterly into humility and make them know that black boys and black girls whom they treated with such condescension, such distain and such good humor had hearts like human beings too, More human hearts than theirs.","They are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it. They have had to believe for many years, and for innumerable reasons, that black men are inferior to white men. Many of them, indeed, know better, but, as you will discover, people find it very difficult to act on what they know. To act is to be committed, and to be committed is to be in danger. In this case, the danger, in the minds of most white Americans, is the loss of their identity.","You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason. The limits of your ambition were, thus, expected to be set forever. You were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity, and in as many ways as possible, that you were a worthless human being. You were not expected to aspire to excellence: you were expected to make peace with mediocrity. Wherever you have turned, James, in your short time on this earth, you have been told where you could go and what you could do (and how you could do it) and where you could live and whom you could marry. I know your countrymen do not agree with me about this, and I hear them saying, \u201cYou exaggerate. They do not know Harlem, and I do. So do you. Take no one\u2019s word for anything, including mine\u2014but trust your experience. Know whence you came. If you know whence you came, there is really no limit to where you can go. The details and symbols of your life have been deliberately constructed to make you believe what white people say about you. Please try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do and cause you to endure, does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear. Please try to be clear, dear James, through the storm which rages about your youthful head today, about the reality which lies behind the words acceptance and integration. There is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you. The really terrible thing, old buddy, is that you must accept them. And I mean that very seriously. You must accept them and accept them with love. For these innocent people have no other hope. They are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it.\u201d","[Art is] very great liberation for the suffering, struggling person, who always thinks that he is alone. This is why art is important. Art would not be important if life were not important, and life is important.","Something very sinister happens to the people of a country when they begin to distrust their own reactions as deeply as they do here, and become as joyless as they have become. It is this individual uncertainty on the part of white American men and women, this inability to renew themselves at the fountain of their own lives, that makes the discussion, let alone elucidation, of any conundrum\u2014that is, any reality\u2014so supremely difficult. The person who distrusts himself has no touchstone for reality\u2014for this touchstone can be only oneself. Such a person interposes between himself and reality nothing less than a labyrinth of attitudes. And these attitudes, furthermore, though the person is usually unaware of it (is unaware of so much!), are historical and public attitudes. They do not relate to the present any more than they relate to the person. Therefore, whatever white people do not know about Negroes reveals, precisely and inexorably, what they do not know about themselves.","Any upheaval in the universe is terrifying because it so profoundly attacks one\u2019s sense of one\u2019s own reality.","Write. Find a way to keep alive and write. There is nothing else to say. If you are going to be a writer there is nothing I can say to stop you; if you\u2019re not going to be a writer nothing I can say will help you. What you really need at the beginning is somebody to let you know that the effort is real.","you have to decide who you are, and force the world to deal with you, not with its idea of you.","I hope that nobodyhas ever had to look at anybody they lovethrough glass.","Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without, but know we cannot live within. I use the word love here, not merely in the personal sense--but as a state of being, or a state of grace. Not in the infantile American sense of being made happy, but in the tough and universal sense of quest, and daring, and growth","I knew the tension in me between love and power, between pain and rage, and the curious, the grinding way I remained extended between these poles\u2014perpetually attempting to choose the better rather than the worse.","I would not allow myself to be defined by other people, white or black. \u2014James Baldwin\u201d","But he was to find, as the prophets had found, that the whole earth became a prison for him who fled before the Lord. There was peace nowhere, and healing nowhere, and forgetfulness nowhere. In every church he entered, his sin had gone before him. It was in the strange, the welcoming faces, it cried up to him from the altar, it sat, as he mounted the pulpit steps, waiting for him in his seat. It stared upward from his Bible: there was no word in all that holy book which did not make him tremble.","Perhaps everybody has a garden of Eden, I don\u2019t know; but they have scarcely seen their garden before they see the flaming sword. The, perhaps, life only offers the choice of remembering the garden or forgetting it. Either, or: it takes strength to remember, it takes another kind of strength to forget, it takes a hero to do both. People who remember court madness through death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget. Heroes are rare.","so could not have had first-hand knowledge of how gleefully a policeman translates his orders from above. But they had no right not to know that; if they did not know that, they knew nothing and had no right to speak as though they were responsible actors in their society; for their complicity with the patriots of that hour meant that the policeman was acting on their orders, too.","One would never defeat one\u2019s circumstances by working and saving one\u2019s pennies; one would never, by working, acquire that many pennies, and, besides, the social treatment accorded even the most successful Negroes proved that one needed, in order to be free, something more than a bank account. One needed a handle, a lever, a means of inspiring fear. It was absolutely clear that the police would whip you and take you in as long as they could get away with it, and that everyone else\u2014housewives, taxi-drivers, elevator boys, dishwashers, bartenders, lawyers, judges, doctors, and grocers\u2014would never, by the operation of any generous human feeling, cease to use you as an outlet for his frustrations and hostilities.","To accept one\u2019s past\u2014one\u2019s history\u2014is not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it. An invented past can never be used; it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought. How can the American Negro\u2019s past be used? The unprecedented price demanded\u2014and at this embattled hour of the world\u2019s history\u2014is the transcendence of the realities of color, of nations, and of altars.","When I watched all the children, their copper, brown, and beige faces staring up at me as I taught Sunday school, I felt that I was committing a crime in talking about the gentle Jesus, in telling them to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life.","America has never wanted its Negroes to be men, and does not, generally, treat them as men. It treats them as mascots, pets, or things. Every Negro woman knows what her man faces when he goes out to work, and what poison he will probably bring back.","Beneath these faces, these clothes, accents, rudeness, was power and sorrow, both unadmitted, unrealized, the power of inventors, the sorrow of the disconnected.","And yet even this was not as real as my despairingsense that nothing was real for me, nothing would ever be real forme again--unless, indeed, this sensation of falling was reality.","\u0130radeli olduklar\u0131na ve kaderlerine h\xfckmedebildiklerine inananlar, bunu ancak kendilerini kand\u0131rmakta uzmanla\u015ft\u0131klar\u0131 oranda s\xfcrd\xfcrebilirler.

Yes, their parts were all cut off, they were dishonored, their very names were nothing more than dust blown disdainfully across the field of time \u2014 to fall where, to blossom where, bringing forth what fruit hereafter, where? \u2014 their very names were not their own. Behind them was the darkness, nothing but the darkness, and all around them destruction, and before them nothing but the fire \u2014 a bastard people, far from God, singing and crying in the wilderness!","And what were these terrors? They were buried beneath the impossible language of the time, lived underground where nearly all of the time\u2019s true feeling spitefully and incessantly fermented. Precisely, therefore, to the extent that they were inexpressible, were these terrors mighty; precisely because they lived in the dark were their shapes obscene. And because the taste for obscenity is universal and the appetite for reality rare and hard to cultivate, he had nearly perished in the basement of his private life. Or, more precisely, his fantasies.","Our power and our fear of change help bind these people to their misery and bewilderment, and insofar as they find this state intolerable we are intolerably menaced.","This innocent country set you down in a ghetto in which, in fact, it intended that you should perish. Let me spell out precisely what I mean by that, for the heart of the matter is here, and the root of my dispute with my country. You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason. The limits of your ambition were, thus, expected to be set forever. You were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity, and in as many ways as possible, that you were a worthless human being. You were not expected to aspire to excellence: you were expected to make peace with mediocrity.","We cannot possibly expect, and should not desire, that the great bulk of the populace embark on a mental and spiritual voyage for which very few people are equipped and which even fewer have survived. They have, after all, their indispensable work to do, even as you and I. What we are distressed about, and should be, when we speak of the state of mass culture in this country, is the overwhelming torpor and bewilderment of the people. The people who run the mass media are not all villains and they are not all cowards\u2014","Neither civilized reason nor Christian love would cause any of those people to treat you as they presumably wanted to be treated; only the fear of your power to retaliate would cause them to do that, or to seem to do it, which was (and is) good enough. There appears to be a vast amount of confusion on this point, but I do not know many Negroes who are eager to be \u201caccepted by white people, still less to be loved by them; they, the blacks, simply don\u2019t wish to be beaten over the head by the whites every instant of our brief passage on this planet. White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this\u2014which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never\u2014the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed. People\u201d","The paradox\u2014and a fearful paradox it is\u2014is that the American Negro can have no future anywhere, on any continent, as long as he is unwilling to accept his past. To accept one\u2019s past\u2014one\u2019s history\u2014is not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it.","It I\'d galling indeed to have stood so long, hat in hand, waiting for Americans to grow up enough to realize that you do not threaten them.

He had once told Esther that if the Lord ever gave him a son he would call him Royal, because the line of the faithful was a royal line \u2014 his son would be a royal child. And this she had remembered as she thrust him from her; with what had perhaps been her last breath she had mocked him and his father with this name. She had died, then, hating him; she had carried into eternity a curse on him and his.","Now, it is true that the nature of society is to create, among its citizens, an illusion of safety; but it is also absolutely true that the safety is always necessarily an illusion. Artists are here to disturb the peace.","You mean I have a home to go to as long as I don\u2019t go there? He laughed. \u201cWell, isn\u2019t it true?

Negro servants have been smuggling odds and ends out of white homes for generations, and white people have been delighted to have them do it, because it has assuaged a dim guilt and testified to the intrinsic superiority of white people.","We are in a rough situation\u2014but, if you really want to think about it, ain\u2019t nothing new about that. That\u2019s just exactly, daughter, when you do not give up. You can\u2019t give up.","I think that people can be better than that, and I know that people van be better than they are. We are capable of bearing a great burden, once we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is.","The great question that faced him this morning was whether or not he had ever, really, been present at his life. For if he had ever been present, then he was present still, and his world would open up before him.","one is permitted to treat any group of people with special disfavor because of their race or the color of their skin, there is no limit to what one will force them to endure, and, since the entire race has been mysteriously indicted, no reason not to attempt to destroy it root and branch.","What is it you wanted me to reconcile myself to? I was born here almost 60 years ago, I\u2019m not gonna live another 60 years. You always told me it takes time. It\u2019s taken my father\u2019s time, my mother\u2019s time. My uncle\u2019s time. My brother\u2019s and my sister\u2019s time. My nieces\u2019 and my nephews\u2019 time. How much time do you want? For your progress.","At this point too, it may be suggested, the legend of Paris has done its deadly work, which is, perhaps, so to stun the traveler with freedom that he begins to long for the prison of home - home then becoming the place where questions are not asked.","In spite of the Puritan-Yankee equation of virtue with well-being, Negroes had excellent reasons for doubting that money was made or kept by any very striking adherence to the Christian virtues; it certainly did not work that way for black Christians. In any case, white people, who had robbed black people of their liberty and who profited by this theft every hour that they lived, had no moral ground on which to stand. They had the judges, the juries, the shotguns, the law\u2014in a word, power. But it was a criminal power, to be feared but not respected, and to be outwitted in any way whatever. And those virtues preached but not practiced by the white world were merely another means of holding Negroes in subjection.","ou think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read","The baby was restless, and I was scared. It was almost time. I was so tired, I almost wanted to die. For a long time, because he was in solitary, I had not been able to see Fonny. I had seen him on this day. He was so skinny; he was so bruised: I almost cried out. To whom, where? I saw this question in Fonny\'s enormous, slanted black eyes\u2013\u2013\xa0eyes that burned, now, like the eyes of a prophet. Yet, when he grinned, I saw, all over again, my lover, as though for the first time.","Where is your life, Gabriel?\' she asked, after a despairing pause, \'Where is it? Ain\u2019t it all done gone for nothing? Where\u2019s your branches?

The shock this spectacle afforded is suggested, surely, by the promptness with which they decided that these black men were not really men but cattle. It is true that the necessity on the part of the settlers of the New World of reconciling their moral assumptions with the fact\u2014and the necessity\u2014of slavery enhanced immensely the charm of this idea, and it is also true that this idea expresses, with a truly American bluntness, the attitude which to varying extents all masters have had toward all slaves.","I am too various to be trusted. If this were not so I would not be alone in this house tonight.","For nothing is fixed, forever and forever and forever, it is not fixed; the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock.","She had known his father when lightning flashed and thunder rolled through Heaven, and his father said: \u2018Listen. God is talking.\u2019 She had known him in the mornings of that far-off country when his father turned on his bed and opened his eyes, and she had looked into those eyes, seeing what they held, and she had not been afraid.","From my chair, I looked out my window, over these dreadful streets.

This was Ezekiel\'s wheel, in the middle of the burning air forever -- and the little wheel ran by faith, and the big wheel ran by the grace of God.","Something very sinister happens to the people of a country when they begin to distrust their own reactions as deeply as they do here, and become as joyless as they have become.

All over Paris they sit behind their counters like a mother bird in a nest and brood over the cash-register as though it were an egg. Nothing occurring under the circle of heaven where they sit escapes their eye, if they have ever been surprised by anything, it was only in a dream - a dream they long ago ceased having. They are neither ill- nor good-natured, though they have their days and styles, and they know, in the way, apparently, that other people know when they have to go to the bathroom, everything about everyone who enters their domain. Though some are white-haired and some not, some fat, some thin, some grandmothers and some but lately virgins, they all have exactly the same shrewd, vacant, all-registering eye; it is difficult to believe that they ever cried for milk, or looked at the sun; it seems they must have come into the world hungry for banknotes, and squinting helplessly, unable to focus their eyes until they came to rest on a cash-register.","Societies are never able to examine, to overhaul themselves: this effort must be made by that yeast which every society cunningly and unfailingly secretes. This ferment, this disturbance, is the responsibility, and the necessity, of writers. It is, alas, the truth that to be an American writer today means mounting an unending attack on all that Americans believe themselves to hold sacred. It means fighting an astute and agile guerrilla warfare with that American complacency which so inadequately masks the American panic.","I mean, I think you\u2019ve got to be truthful about the life you have. Otherwise, there\u2019s no possibility of achieving the life you want.","One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself\u2014that is to say, risking oneself.","White America remains unable to believe that black America\u2019s grievances are real; they are unable to believe this because they cannot face what this fact says about themselves and their country; and the effect of this massive and hostile incomprehension is to increase the danger in which all black people live here, especially the young.","It is cruel to have made me want to live, only to make my death more bloody.","We don\u2019t know enough about ourselves. I think it\u2019s better to know that you don\u2019t know, that way you can grow with the mystery as the mystery grows in you. But, these days, of course, everybody knows everything, that\u2019s why so many people, especially most white people, are so lost.","He must be \u201cgood not only in order to please his parents and not only to avoid being punished by them; behind their authority stands another, nameless and impersonal, infinitely harder to please, and bottomlessly cruel. And this filters into the child\u2019s consciousness through his parents\u2019 tone of voice as he is being exhorted, punished, or loved; in the sudden, uncontrollable note of fear heard in his mother\u2019s or his father\u2019s voice when he has strayed beyond some particular boundary. He does not know what the boundary is, and he can get no explanation of it, which is frightening enough, but the fear he hears in the voices of his elders is more frightening still. The fear that I heard in my father\u2019s voice, for example, when he realized that I really believed I could do anything a white boy could do, and had every intention of proving it, was not at all like the fear I heard when one of us was ill or had fallen down the stairs or strayed too far from the house. It was another fear, a fear that the child, in challenging the white world\u2019s assumptions, was putting himself in the path of destruction.\u201d","[...] they stormed all over me, my awakening, my insistent possibilities.","Women are like water. They are tempting like that, and they can be that treacherous, and they can seem to be that bottomless, you know? -- and that shallow.","But the fact that I had said it as he held my hand made it sound to me unutterably helpless and soft and coy.","Love him, said Jacques, with vehemence, love him and let him love you.

Only five minutes, I assure you, only five minutes, and most of that, helas! in the dark. And if you think of them as dirty, then they will be dirty - they will be dirty because you will be giving nothing, you will be despising your flesh and his. But you can make your time together anything but dirty, you can give each other something which will make both of you better - forever - if you will not be ashamed, if you will only not play it safe.","We cannot possibly expect, and should not desire, that the great bulk of the populace embark on a mental and spiritual voyage for which very few people are equipped and which even fewer have survived.

The people who run the mass media are not all villains and they are not all cowards\u2014though I agree, I must say, with Dwight Macdonald\u2019s forceful suggestion that many of them are not very bright. (Why should they be? They, too, have risen from the streets to a high level of cultural attainment. They, too, are positively afflicted by the world\u2019s highest standard of living and what is probably the world\u2019s most bewilderingly empty way of life.) But even those who are bright are handicapped by their audience: I am less appalled by the fact that Gunsmoke is produced than I am by the fact that so many people want to see it. In the same way, I must add, that a thrill of terror runs through me when I hear that the favorite author of our President is Zane Grey.","I don\'t believe in this nonsense about time.

I was in a terrible confusion. Sometimes I thought, but this is your life. Stop fighting it. Or I thought, but I am happy. And he loves me. I am safe. Sometimes, when he was not near me, I thought, I will never let him touch me again. Then, when he touched me, I thought it doesn\'t matter, it is only the body, it will soon be over. When it was over I lay in the dark and listened to his breathing and dreamed of the touch of hands, of Giovanni\'s hands, or anybody\'s hands, hands which would have the power to crush me and make me whole again.","Of course, I must say that I don\u2019t think America is God\u2019s gift to anybody\u2014if it is, God\u2019s days have got to be numbered. That God these people say they serve\u2014and do serve, in ways that they don\u2019t know\u2014has got a very nasty sense of humor. Like you\u2019d beat the shit out of Him, if He was a man.

It had been said so often that John, without ever thinking about it, had come to believe it himself. Not until the morning of his fourteenth birthday did he really begin to think about it, and by then it was already too late","For the horrors of the American Negro\'s life there has been almost no language.... And, in fact, the truth about the black man, as a historical entity and as a human being, has been hidden from him, deliberately and cruelly; the power of the white world is threatened whenever a black man refuses to accept the white world\'s definitions.","It is the responsibility of free en to trust and to celebrate what is constant\u2014birth, struggle, and death are constant, and so is love, though we may not always think so\u2014and to apprehend the nature of change, to be able and willing to change. I speak of change not on the surface but in the depths\u2014change in the sense of renewal.

This means that there is a man in every woman, and a woman in every man. Sometimes this is recognised only when the chips are, brutally, down - when there is no longer any way to avoid this recognition. But love between a man and a woman, or love between any two human beings, would not be possible did we not have available to us the spiritual resources of both sexes.","It is a terrible omen when you see an American flag on somebody else\u2019s car and realize that\u2019s your enemy.","Does she want you or does she not want you?\u2019\u2018She went to Spain,\u2019 I said, \u2018to find out\u2019.

What is she doing, testing all the Spaniards and comparing them with you?","To begin with, the room was not large enough for two. It looked out on a small courtyard. \'Looked out\' means only that the room had two windows, against which the courtyard malevolently pressed, encroaching day by day, as though it had confused itself with a jungle.","In the United States, violence and heroism have been made synonymous except when it comes to blacks,","But above all\u2014and this cannot be stressed strongly enough\u2014meaning was always utmost. Despite a highly evolved aesthetic sensibility, despite a punishingly high level of artistic standards, Baldwin\u2019s goal was always to communicate, not to show off.","I had discovered, through ugly experience, what they were like when they held the power and what they were like when you held the power.","That summer, in any case, all the fears with which I had grown up, and which were now a part of me and controlled my vision of the world, rose up like a wall between the world and me, and drove me into the church.","[...] under his beauty and his bravado, terror, and a terrible desire to please; dreadfully moving, and it made me want, in anguish, to reach out and comfort him.","Close up, you see the person\'s wrinkles, warts, and pimples; when close to you, the person has innumerable ways of driving you up the wall: but when far from you, these very same imperfections become irreplaceable and beautiful, testifying, after all, to how much each cared about the other. Close up, the person\'s imperfections matter, but from far away, you see your own. The questions then is not How did I stand her? but How did she stand me?","The necessity for a form of socialism is based on the observation that the world\u2019s present economic arrangements doom most of the world to misery; that the way of life dictated by these arrangements is both sterile and immoral; and, finally, that there is no hope for peace in the world so long as these arrangements obtain.","It is a fact that every American Negro bears a name that originally belonged to the white man whose chattel he was. I am called Baldwin because I was either sold by my African tribe or kidnapped out of it into the hands of a white Christian named Baldwin, who forced me to kneel at the foot of the cross. I am, then, both visibly and legally the descendant of slaves in a white, Protestant country, and this is what it means to be an American Negro, this is who he is\u2014","You can only be destroyed by believing that you really are what the white world calls a nigger.","It is easy to say that Baldwin\u2019s main message was racial equality. Surely the topic flows through his work more than it ebbs. Yet one makes a grave mistake in pigeonholing James Baldwin\u2019s worldview so narrowly, for throughout this miscellany, though racial topics and racial politics are often the touchstone, his true themes are more in line with the early church fathers, with Erasmus of Rotterdam, with the great Western philosophers, with theologians like Reinhold Niebuhr and Dietrich Bonhoeffer and James Cone. And though it is too broad\u2014if not useless\u2014to say his true topic is humanity, it is useful to see how, no matter his topic, how often his writing finds some ur-morality upon which to rest, how he always sees matters through a lens of decency, how he writes with his heart as well as with his head. Baldwin left the pulpit at sixteen, but he never stopped preaching.","But to look back from the stony plain along the road which led one to that place is not at all the same thing as walking on the road; the perspective, to say the very least, changes only with the journey; only when the road has, all abruptly and treacherously, and with an absoluteness that permits no argument, turned or dropped or risen is one able to see all that one could not have seen from any other place.","When two people have so much to say to each other that there\'s almost nothing they can say, and they just stare at each other. But that\'s saying something, too.","It was the face of a man, of a tormented man. Yet, in precisely the way that great music depends, ultimately, on great silence, this masculinity was defined, and made powerful, by something which was not masculine. But it was not feminine, either, and something in Vivaldo resisted the word androgynous. It was a quality to which great numbers of people would respond without not knowing to what it was they were responding. There was great force in the face, and great gentleness. But, as most women are not gentle, nor most men strong, it was a face which suggested, resonantly, in the depths, the truth about our natures.","[...] how I stood, with my love and my ingenuity, between him and the dark.","I looked around the subway car. It was a little like the drawings I had seen of slave ships. Of course, they hadn\'t had newspapers on the slave ships, hadn\'t needed them yet; but, as concerned space (and also, perhaps, as concerned intention) the principle was exactly the same.","And i have seen it in the eyes of rookie cops in Harlem - rookie cops who were really the most terrified people in the world, and who had to pretend to themselves that the black junkie, the black mother, the black father, the black child were of different human species than themselves . The southern sheriff, the rookie cop, could, and I suspect still can only deal with their lives and their duties by hiding behind the colour curtain - a curtain which, indeed, eventually becomestheir principal justification for the lives they leadThey thus will barricade themselves behind this curtain and continue in their crime, in the great unadmitted crime of what they have done to themselves.","...all the fears with which I had grown up, and which were now a part of me and controlled my vision of the world, rose up like a wall between the world and me...","Most people live in almost total darkness\u2026people, millions of people whom you will never see, who don\u2019t know you, never will know you, people who may try to kill you in the morning, live in a darkness which...if you have that funny terrible thing which every artist can recognize and no artist can define...you are responsible to those people to lighten, and it does not matter what happens to you. You are being used in the way a crab is useful, the way sand certainly has some function. It is impersonal. This force which you didn\u2019t ask for, and this destiny which you must accept, is also your responsibility. And if you survive it, if you don\u2019t cheat, if you don\u2019t lie, it is not only, you know, your glory, your achievement, it is almost our only hope... Because only an artist can tell, and only artists have told since we have heard of man, what it is like for anyone who gets to this planet to survive it. What it is like to die, or to have somebody die; what it is like to be glad... The trouble is that although the artist can do it, the price that he has to pay himself and that you, the audience, must also pay, is a willingness to give up everything, to realize that although you spent twenty-seven years acquiring this house, this furniture, this position, although you spent forty years raising this child, these children, nothing, none of it belongs to you. You can only have it by letting it go. You can only take if you are prepared to give...It is a total risk of everything, of you and who you think you are, who you think you\u2019d like to be, where you think you\u2019d like to go...everything, and this forever, forever.","Take no one\u2019s word for anything, including mine\u2014but trust your experience.","A child is too self-centered to relate to any dilemma that does not, somehow relate to him.","It is louder than an untrained orchestra in rehearsal and the sound of infants and children is the theme: tremendously developed, in extraordinary harmonies, in the voices of the elders.","Voyagers discover that the world can never be larger than the person that is in the world; but it is impossible to foresee this, it is impossible to be warned. It is only when time has begun spilling through his fingers like water or sand--carrying away with it, forever, dreams, possibilities, challenges, and hopes--that the young man realizes that he will not be young forever. If he wishes to paint a picture, raise a family, write a book, design a building, start a war--well, he does not have forever in which to do it.","... this is the crime of which I accuse my country and my countrymen, and for which neither I nor time nor history will ever forgive them...","Know whence you came.

They were rolling up startling Seventh Avenue. The entire population seemed to be in the streets, draped, almost, from lampposts, stoops, and hydrants, and walking through the traffic as though it were not there. \u201cKept you here, and stunted you and starved you, and made you watch your mother and father and sister and lover and brother and son and daughter die or go mad or go under, before your very eyes? And not in a hurry, like from one day to the next, but, every day, every day, for years, for generations? Shit. They keep you here because you\u2019re black, the filthy, white cock suckers, while they go around jerking themselves off with all that jazz about the land of the free and the home of the brave.\u201d","It is the responsibility of free men to trust and to celebrate what is constant\u2014birth, struggle, and death are constant, and so is love, though we may not always think so\u2014and to apprehend the nature of change, to be able and willing to change.

But maybe it does some good if you believe it.","I had first been in San Francisco at the height of the civil rights movement, first on an Esquire junket, then on a lecture tour. There had been no flower children here then, only earnest, eager students anxious to know what they could \u201cdo.","The time has come, God knows, for us to examine ourselves, but we can only do this if we are willing to free ourselves of the myth of America and try to find out what is really happening here.","But, you can\'t just go on being a brick stonewall forever.\'\'I don\'t see why not,\' she said. \'Nor do I see how not.","I was introduced, they greeted me with a genuine cordiality and respect - and the respect increased my fright, for it meant that they expected something of me, that I knew in my heart, for their sakes, I could not give - and we sat down.","C\'est leur innocence qui constitue leur crime","[...] she was disquietingly fluid \u2014 fluid, without, however, being able to flow.","t can be objected that I am speaking of political freedom in spiritual terms, but the political institutions of any nation are always menaced and are ultimately controlled by the spiritual state of that nation. We are controlled here by our confusion, far more than we know, and the American dream has therefore become something much more closely resembling a nightmare, on the private, domestic, and international levels. Privately, we cannot stand our lives and dare not examine them; domestically, we take no responsibility for (and no pride in) what goes on in our country; and, internationally, for many millions of people, we are an unmitigated disaster.","Crime","I realized that the Bible had been written by white men. I knew that, according to many Christians, I was a descendant of Ham, who had been cursed, and that I was therefore predestined to be a slave.","The blacks, for the most part, were not to be found with the flower children. In the eerie American way, they walked the same streets, were to be found in the same neighborhoods, were the targets of the very same forces, seemed to bear each other no ill will\u2014on the contrary indeed, especially from the point of view of the forces watching them\u2014and yet they seemed to have no effect on each other, and they certainly were not together. The blacks were not putting their trust in flowers. They were putting their trust in guns.","We no longer talked about our love affairs, for either they had failed, were failing, or were serious. Above all they were private\u2014how can love be talked about? It is probably the most awful of all the revelations this little life affords.","And in any case, what really exercises my mind is not this hypothetical day on which some other Negro \u201cfirst will become the first Negro President.

This can only begin to happen as the truth begins to be told. We are in the middle of an immense metamorphosis here, a metamorphosis which will, it is devoutly to be hoped, rob us of our myths and give us our history, which will destroy our attitudes and give us back our personalities. The mass culture, in the meantime, can only reflect our chaos: and perhaps we had better remember that this chaos contains life\u2014and a great transforming energy. (1959)","A liar always knows he is lying, and that is why liars travel in packs: in order to be reassured that the judgment day will never come for them.

One needed a handle, a lever, a means of inspiring fear.","When one begins to search for the crucial, the definitive moment, the moment which changed all others, one finds oneself pressing, in great pain, through a maze of false signals and abruptly locking doors.","white Americans have supposed \u201cEurope and \u201ccivilization\u201d to be synonyms\u2014which they are not\u2014and have been distrustful of other standards and other sources of vitality, especially those produced in America itself, and have attempted to behave in all matters as though what was east for Europe was also east for them.\u201d","It was his hatred and his intelligence that he cherished, the one feeding the other.","White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this\u2014which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never\u2014the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.","All they really knew were two darknesses, the darkness of their lives, which was now closing in on them, and the darkness of the movies, which had blinded them to that other darkness,","They had the judges, the juries, the shotguns, the law\u2014in a word, power.","BALDWIN: There\u2019s no such thing as safety on this planet. No one knows that much. No one ever will. Not only about the world but about himself. That\u2019s why it\u2019s unsafe. This is what the whole sense of tragedy is really about. People think that a sense of tragedy is a kind of\xa0\u2026\xa0embroidery, something irrelevant, that you can take or leave. But, in fact, it is a necessity. That\u2019s what the Blues and Spirituals are all about. It is the ability to look on things as they are and survive your losses, or even not survive them\u2014to know that your losses are coming. To know they are coming is the only possible insurance you have, a faint insurance, that you will survive them.","Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.

And it does not matter what the gimmick is.\u201d","One can be, indeed one must strive to become, tough and philosophical concerning destruction and death, for this is what most of mankind has been best at since we have heard of man. (But remember: most of mankind is not all of mankind.)","There was not, after all, a great difference between the world of the North and that of the South which she had fled; there was only this difference: the North promised more. And this similarity: what it promised it did not give, and what it gave, at length and grudgingly with one hand, it took back with the other. Now she understood in this nervous, hollow, ringing city, that nervousness of Richard\'s which had so attracted her\u2014a tension so total, and so without the hope, or possibility of release, or resolution, that she felt it in his muscles, and heard it in his breathing, even as on her breast he fell asleep.","Negroes in this country\u2014and Negroes do not, strictly or legally speaking, exist in any other\u2014are taught really to despise themselves from the moment their eyes open on the world.","Still, my flight had been dictated by my hope that I could find myself in a place where I would be treated more humanely than my society had treated me at home, where my risks would be more personal, and my fate less austerely sealed. And Paris had done this for me: by leaving me completely alone. I lived in Paris for a long time without making a single French friend, and even longer before I saw the inside of a French home. This did not really upset me, either, for Henry James had been here before me and had had the generosity to clue me in. Furthermore, for a black boy who had grown up on Welfare and the chicken-shit goodwill of American liberals, this total indifference came as a great relief and, even, as a mark of respect.","But the Negro\'s experience of the white world cannot possibly create in him any respect for the standards by which the white world claims to live. His own condition is overwhelming proof that white people do not live by these standards.","He wanted no distance between us; he wanted me to look on him as a man like myself. But I wanted the merciful distance of father and son, which would have permitted me to love him.","Long before the Negro child perceives this difference, and even longer before he understands it, he has begun to react to it, he has begun to be controlled by it. Every effort made by the child\u2019s elders to prepare him for a fate from which they cannot protect him causes him secretly, in terror, to begin to await, without knowing that he is doing so, his mysterious and inexorable punishment. He must be \u201cgood not only in order to please his parents and not only to avoid being punished by them; behind their authority stands another, nameless and impersonal, infinitely harder to please, and bottomlessly cruel. And this filters into the child\u2019s consciousness through his parents\u2019 tone of voice as he is being exhorted, punished, or loved;\u201d","Non serve cercar di andare troppo a fondo in questo mistero che \xe8 tanto poco semplice quanto poco innocuo.

But it was a criminal power, to be feared but not respected, and to be outwitted in any way whatever. And those virtues preached but not practiced by the white world were merely another means of holding Negroes in subjection.","I know that I was christened Clementine, and so it would make sense if people called me Clem, or even, come to think of it, Clementine, since that\u2019s my name: but they don\u2019t. People call me Tish.","I defended myself, as I imagined, against the fear my father made me feel by remembering that he was very old-fashioned. Also, I prided myself on the fact that I already knew how to outwit him. To defend oneself against a fear is simply to insure that one will, one day, be conquered by it; fears must be faced. As for one\u2019s wits, it is just not true that one can live by them\u2014not, that is, if one wishes really to live.","The artistic objects by which they are surrounded cannot possibly fulfill their original function of disturbing the peace\u2014which is still the only method by which the mind can be improved\u2014they bear witness instead to the attainment of a certain level of economic stability and a certain thin measure of sophistication. But art and ideas come out of the passion and torment of experience: it is impossible to have a real relationship to the first if one\u2019s aim is to be protected from the second.","Our humanity is our burden, our life. We need not battle for it. We need only to do what is infinitely more difficult: that is, accept it.","White Americans find it as difficult as white people elsewhere do to divest themselves of the notion that they are in possession of some intrinsic value that black people need, or want.","One writes out of one thing only \u2014 one\u2019s own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from the experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give.","Whose little boy are you? Now this, unbelievably, was precisely the phrase used by pimps and racketeers on the Avenue when they suggested, both humorously and intensely, that I \u201chang out\u201d with them. Perhaps part of the terror they had caused me to feel came from the fact that I unquestionably wanted to be somebody\u2019s little boy. I was so frightened, and at the mercy of so many conundrums, that inevitably, that summer, someone would have taken me over; one doesn\u2019t, in Harlem, long remain standing on any auction block. It was my good luck\u2014perhaps\u2014that I found myself in the church racket instead of some other, and surrendered to a spiritual seduction long before I came to any carnal knowledge.

But in our time, as in every time, the impossible is the least that one can demand\u2014and one is, after all, emboldened by the spectacle of human history in general, and American Negro history in particular, for it testifies to nothing less than the perpetual achievement of the impossible.","Take no one\'s word for anything, including mine\u2014but trust your experience.

Now I pitied them, pitied them in order not to despise them. And this is not the happiest way to feel toward one\'s countrymen.","It seemed to have no sense whatever of the exigencies of human life; it was so familiar and so public that it became, at last, the most despairingly private of cities.

I had never had any occasion to judge them, as it were, intimately. For me, simply, McCarthy was a coward and a bully, with no claim to honor, nor any claim to honorable attention. For me, emphatically, there were not two sides to this dubious coin, and, as to his baleful and dangerous effect, there could be no question at all. Yet, they spent hours debating whether or not McCarthy was an enemy of domestic liberties. I couldn\u2019t but wonder what conceivable further proof they were awaiting: I thought of German Jews sitting around debating whether or not Hitler was a threat to their lives until the debate was summarily resolved for them by a knocking at the door.","It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connect me with all the people that were alive, or who had ever been alive.","But people can\u2019t, unhappily, invent their mooring posts, their lovers and their friends, anymore than they can invent their parents.

(p. 81)","The Negro can precipitate this abdication because white Americans have never, in all their long history, been able to look on him as a man like themselves. This point need not be labored; it is proved over and over again by the Negro\u2019s continuing position here, and his indescribable struggle to defeat the stratagems that white Americans have used, and use, to deny him his humanity.","Loving anybody and being loved by anybody is a tremendous danger, a tremendous responsibility.","Whether he is with others or not he is certainly alone.","The spreading of the Gospel, regardless of the motives or the integrity or the heroism of some of the missionaries, was an absolutely indispensable justification for the planting of the flag.","They must continue to produce things they do not really admire, still less love, in order to continue buying things they do not really want, still less need.","I never wish to make love again with anything more than the body.","For the world called to the heart, which stammered to reply; life, and love, and revelry, and, most falsely, hope, called the forgetful, the human heart. Only the soul, obsessed with the journey it had made, and had still to make, pursued its mysterious and dreadful end; and carried, heavy with weeping and bitterness, the heart along.","This shy, confiding smile made his heart move up until it hung like a Ferris wheel at its zenith, looking down at the fair.","The Negro came to the white man for a roof or for five dollars or for a letter to the judge; the white man came to the Negro for love. But he was not often able to give what he came seeking. The price was too high; he had too much to lose. And the Negro knew this, too. When one knows this about a man, it is impossible for one to hate him, but unless he becomes a man\u2014becomes equal\u2014 it is also impossible for one to love him.","What it comes to is that if we, who can scarcely be considered a white nation, persist in thinking of ourselves as one, we condemn ourselves, with the truly white nations, to sterility and decay, whereas if we could accept ourselves as we are, we might bring new life to the Western achievements, and transform them. The price of this transformation is the unconditional freedom of the Negro;","The glorification of one race and the consequent debasement of another \u2014 or others \u2014 always has been and always will be a recipe for murder. There is no way around this. If one is permitted to treat any group of people with special disfavor because of their race or the color of their skin, there is no limit to what one will force them to endure, and, since the entire race has been mysteriously indicted, no reason not to attempt to destroy it root and branch. This is precisely what the Nazis attempted. Their originality lay in the means they used. It is scarcely worthwhile to attempt remembering how many times the sun has looked down on the slaughter of the innocents. I am very much concerned American Negroes achieve their freedom here in the United States. But I am also concerned for their dignity, for the health of their souls, and must oppose any attempt that Negroes may make to do to others what has been done to them. I think I know \u2014 we see it around us every day \u2014 the spiritual wasteland to which that road leads.","Many of them, indeed, know better, but, as you will discover, people find it very difficult to act on what they know.

Privately, we cannot stand our lives and dare not examine them; domestically, we take no responsibility for (and no pride in) what goes on in our country; and, internationally, for many millions of people, we are an unmitigated disaster.","The white racist has ruled the world for a long time, and the crises we are undergoing now are involved with the fact that the habits of power are not only extremely hard to lose; they are as tenacious as some incurable disease.","The American Negro has the great advantage of having never believed that collection of myths to which white Americans cling: that their ancestors were all freedom-loving heroes, that they were born in the greatest country the world has ever seen, or that Americans are invincible in battle and wise in peace, that Americans have always dealt honorably with Mexicans and Indians and all other neighbors or inferiors, that American men are the world\u2019s most direct and virile, that American women are pure. Negroes know far more about white Americans than that; it can almost be said, in fact, that they know about white Americans what parents\u2014or, anyway, mothers\u2014know about their children, and that they very often regard white Americans that way. And perhaps this attitude, held in spite of what they know and have endured, helps to explain why Negroes, on the whole, and until lately, have allowed themselves to feel so little hatred. The tendency has really been, insofar as this was possible, to dismiss white people as the slightly mad victims of their own brainwashing.","Come. I am sure that I am much prettier than your wallpaper - or your concierge. I will smile at you when you wake up. They will not.","The American Negro has the great advantage of having never believed that collection of myths to which white Americans cling: that their ancestors were all freedom-loving heroes, that they were born in the greatest country the world has ever seen, or that Americans are invincible in battle and wise in peace, that Americans have always dealt honorably with Mexicans and Indians and all other neighbors","In short, we, the black and the white, deeply need each other here if we are really to become a nation\u2014if we are really, that is, to achieve our identity, our maturity, as men and women.","And yet power is real, and many things, including, very often, love, cannot be achieved without it.","One would never defeat one\'s circumstances by working and saving one\'s pennies; one would never, by working, acquire that many pennies, and, besides, the social treatment accorded even the most successful Negroes proved that one needed, in order to be free, something more than a bank account.","If we know, and do nothing, we are worse that the murderers hired in our name. If we know, then we must fight for your life as though it were our own - which it is - and render impasssable with our bodies the corridor the the gas chamber. For, if they take you in the morning, they will be coming for us that night.","Why would I want to poison you? Then I have no job and I have only just found out that I want to live.","Because even if I should speak, no one would believe me. And they would not believe me precisely because they would know that what I said was true.","It is not too much to say that whoever wishes to become a truly moral human being (and let us not ask whether or not this is possible; I think we must believe that it is possible) must first divorce himself from all the prohibitions, crimes, and hypocrisies of the Christian church. If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time we got rid of Him.

And now you must survive because we love you, and for the sake of your children and your children\'s children.","Perhaps we were, all of us\u2014pimps, whores, racketeers, church members, and children\u2014bound together by the nature of our oppression, the specific and peculiar complex of risks we had to run; if so, within these limits we sometimes achieved with each other a freedom that was close to love.","Time and time and time again, the people discover that they have merely betrayed themselves into the hands of yet another Pharaoh, who, since he was necessary to put the broken country together, will not let them go.","Maybe everything bad that happens to you makes you weaker,\u2019 said Giovanni, as though he had not heard me, \u2018and so you can stand less and less.","America could have used in other ways the energy that both groups have expended in this conflict. America, of all the Western nations, has been best placed to prove the uselessness and the obsolescence of the concept of color.","And blood, in all the cities through which he passed, ran down. There seemed no door, anywhere, behind which blood did not call out, unceasingly, for blood; no woman whether singing before defiant trumpets or rejoicing before the Lord, who had not seen her father, her brother, her lover, or her son cut down without mercy; who had not seen her sister become part of the white man\'s great whorehouse, who had not, all too narrowly, escaped that house herself; no man... who had not been made to bend his head and drink white men\'s muddy water... their very names were nothing more than dust blown disdainfully across the field of time - to fall where, to blossom where, bringing forth what fruit hereafter, where? their very names were not their own. Behind them was the darkness, nothing but the darkness, and all around them destruction, and before them nothing but the fire - a bastard people, far from God, singing and crying in the wilderness!","I was icily determined\u2014more determined, really, than I then knew\u2014never to make my peace with the ghetto but to die and go to Hell before I would let any white man spit on me, before I would accept my \\"place\\" in this republic.","We human beings now have the power to exterminate ourselves; this seems to be the entire sum of our achievement. We have taken this journey and arrived at this place in God\u2019s name. This, then, is the best that God (the white God) can do. If that is so, then it is time to replace Him\u2014replace Him with what?","If I am not here\' said Giovanni, both vindictive and near tears, \'by the time you come back again, I will be at home. You remember where that is - ? It is near a zoo.","He looked at me very soberly. \'She sounds more and more impossible, this little girlof yours. What does she do, follow you everywhere?","Most Negroes cannot risk assuming that the humanity of white people is more real to them than their color. And this leads, imperceptibly but inevitably, to a state of mind in which, having long ago learned to expect the worst, one finds it very easy to believe the worst. The brutality with which Negroes are treated in this country simply cannot be overstated, however unwilling white men may be to hear it. In the beginning--and neither can this be overstated--a Negro just cannot believe that white people are treating him as they do; he does not know what he has done to merit it. And when he realizes that the treatment accorded him has nothing to do with anything he has done, that the attempt of white people to destroy him--for that it is what it is--is utterly gratuitous, it\'s not hard for him to think of white people as devils.","The principles were Blindness, Loneliness, and Terror, the first principle necessarily and actively cultivated in order to deny the two others. I would love to believe that the principles were Faith, Hope, and Charity, but this is clearly not so for most Christians, or for what we call the Christian world.","I\u2019ve never come across any shame down here, except shame like mine, except the shame of the hardworking black ladies, who call me Daughter, and the shame of proud Puerto Ricans, who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happened\u2014no one who speaks to them speaks Spanish, for example\u2014and who are ashamed that they have loved ones in jail.

And you will have no idea of the life there, dripping and bursting and beautiful and terrible, as you have no idea of my life now.

It had been written because he was afraid, afraid of things dark, strange, dangerous, difficult, and deep.","And I stared at the room with the same, nervous, calculating extension of the intelligence and of all one\u2019s forces which occurs when gauging a mortal and unavoidable danger: at the silent walls of the room with its distant, archaic lovers trapped in an interminable rose garden, and the staring windows, staring like two great eyes of ice and fire, and the ceiling which lowered like those clouds out of which fiends have sometimes spoken and which obscured but failed to soften its malevolence behind the yellow light which hung like a diseased and undefinable sex in its center.","Black people, mainly, look down or look up but do not look at each other, not at you, and white people, mainly, look away.","...the whole motion of the figure is torment. It seemed a very strange figure for such a young kid to do, or, at least, it seemed strange until you thought about it.","Words like \u201cfreedom, \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201cdemocracy\u201d are not common concepts; on the contrary, they are rare. People are not born knowing what these are. It takes enormous and, above all, individual effort to arrive at the respect for other people that these words imply. --\u201cThe Crusade of Indignation,\u201d in Nation\u201d","the look in his eyes was so bottomlessly bitter it was almost benevolent.","All of the Western nations have been caught in a lie, the lie of their pretended humanism; this means that their history has no moral justification, and that the West has no moral authority.","They come through Ellis Island, where Giorgio becomes Joe, Pappavasiliu becomes Palmer, Evangelos becomes Evans, Goldsmith becomes Smith or Gold, and Avakian becomes King. So, with a painless change of name, and in the twinkling of an eye, one becomes a white American.","Fonny had found something that he could do, that he wanted to do, and this saved him from the death that was waiting to overtake the children of our age. Though the death took many forms, though people died early in many different ways, the death itself was very simple and the cause was simple, too: as simple as a plague: the kids had been told that they weren\'t worth shit and everything they saw around them proved it. They struggled, they struggled, but they fell, like flies, and they congregated on the garbage heaps of their lives, like flies.","Here\u2019s the thing about James Baldwin\u2019s prose: As noted earlier, from the start, he was audacious in his love for complex sentences; one might say even fearless in the way he deployed the English language. Faulkner, Virginia Woolf, Malcolm Lowry, among English-language writers, dared put so much demand on the language. To watch them create a sentence is often like watching a high-wire act. Death-defying sentences. Lush, romantic sentences. Sentences that dared to swallow the entire world.","Try to imagine how you would feel if you woke up one morning to find the sun shining and all the stars aflame. You would be frightened because it is out of the order of nature. Any upheaval in the universe is terrifying because it so profoundly attacks one\u2019s sense of one\u2019s own reality. Well, the black man has functioned in the white man\u2019s world as a fixed star, as an immovable pillar: and as he moves out of his place, heaven and earth are shaken to their foundations.","I know very well that my ancestors had no desire to come to this place: but neither did the ancestors of the people who became white and who require my captivity song; They require of me a song less to celebrate my captivity than to justify their own.","Yes. It will get worse. But the baby, turning for the first time in its incredible veil of water, announces its presence and claims me; tells me, in that instant, that what can get worse can get better; and that what can get better can get worse. In the meantime\u2014forever\u2014it is entirely up to me. The baby cannot get here without me. And, while I may have known this, in one way, a little while ago, now the baby knows it, and tells me that while it will certainly be worse, once it leaves the water, what gets worse can also get better. It will be in the water for a while yet: but it is preparing itself for a transformation. And so must I. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m not afraid.","The aim of the dreamer, after all, is merely to go on dreaming and not to be molested by the world. His dreams are his protection against the world. But the aims of life are antithetical to those of the dreamer, and the teeth of the world are sharp.","You win. You\'re the philosopher.","The real reason that nonviolence is considered to be a virtue in Negroes\u2014I am not speaking now of its racial value, another matter altogether\u2014is that white men do not want their lives, their self-image, or their property threatened. One wishes they would say so more often.","His face looked as though it were plunging into water. I couldn\'t touch him. I wanted so to touch him. ...But he was far away from me now, all by himself. I waited for him to come back.","What you people don\'t know,\' she said, \'is that life is a bitch, baby. It\'s the biggest hype going. You don\'t have any experience in paying your dues and it\'s going to be rough on you, baby, when the deal goes down. There\'re lots of back dues to be collected, and I know damn well you haven\'t got a penny saved.","She was like a wild animal who didn\'t know whether to come to the outstretched hand or to flee and kept making startled little rushes, first in one direction and then in the other.","It is really quite impossible to be affirmative about anything which one refuses to question; one is doomed to remain inarticulate about anything which one hasn\u2019t, by an act of the imagination, made one\u2019s own.","...they ain\'t never met nobody they didn\'t lie to and steal from.","The paradox of education is precisely this \u2014 that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society in which he is being educated. The purpose of education, finally, is to create in a person the ability to look at the world for himself, to make his own decisions, to say to himself this is black or this is white, to decide for himself whether there is a God in heaven or not. To ask questions of the universe, and then learn to live with those questions, is the way he achieves his own identity. But no society is really anxious to have that kind of person around.","We had, in effect, been playing a deadly game and he was the winner. He was the winner in spite of the fact that I had cheated to win.","though","(As your experience about writing accrues) you learn how little you know. It becomes much more difficult because the hardest thing in the world is simplicity. And the most fearful thing, too. It becomes more difficult because you have to strip yourself of all your disguises, some of which you didn\'t know you had.","Zeus,","But the private life of a black woman, to say nothing of the private life of a black man, cannot really be considered at all. To consider this forbidden privacy is to violate white privacy -- by destroying the white dream of the blacks; to make black privacy a black and private matter makes white privacy real, for the first time: which is, indeed, and with a vengeance, to endanger the stewardship of Rhodesia. The situation of the white heroine must never violate the white self-image. Her situation must always transcend the inexorability of the social setting, so that her innocence may be preserved: Grace Kelly, when she shoots to kill at the end of \'High Noon,\' for example, does not become a murderess. But the situation of the black heroine, to say nothing of the black hero, must always be left at society\'s mercy: in order to justify white history and in order to indicate the essential validity of the black condition.","Once one has begun to suspect this much about the world \u2014 once one has begun to suspect, that is, that one is not, and never will be, innocent, for the reason that no one is \u2014 some of the self-protective veils between oneself and reality begin to fall away.","But, in the end, it is the threat of universal extinction hanging over all the world today that changes, totally and forever, the nature of reality and brings into devastating question the true meaning of man\'s history. We human beings now have the power to exterminate ourselves; this seems to be the entire sum of our achievement. We have taken this journey and arrived at this place in God\'s name. This, then, is the best that God (the white God) can do. if that is so, then it is time to replace Him-replace Him with what? And this void, this despair, this torment is felt everywhere in the West, from the streets of Stockholm to the churches of New Orleans and the sidewalks off Harlem","but the way to be really despicable is to be contemptuous of other people\'s pain.","And they didn\u2019t even read; depressed populations don\u2019t have the time or energy to spare. The affluent populations, which should have been their help, didn\u2019t, as far as could be discovered, read, either\u2014they merely bought books and devoured them, but not in order to learn: in order to learn new attitudes.","Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have... One... ought to earn one\'s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life.","Reading a Baldwin sentence can feel like recreating thought itself. One has to take hands off the rudder and trust the river of thought as it flows.","The first time I saw Reverend Shuttlesworth, for example, he came strolling across the parking lot of the motel where I was staying, his hat perched precariously between the back of his skull and the nape of his neck, alone. It was late at night, and Shuttlesworth was a marked man in Birmingham. He came up into my room, and, while we talked, he kept walking back and forth to the window. I finally realized that he was keeping an eye on his car\u2014making sure that no one put a bomb in it, perhaps. As he said nothing about this, however, naturally I could not. But I was worried about his driving home alone, and, as he was leaving, I could not resist saying something to this effect. And he smiled\u2014smiled as though I were a novice, with much to learn, which was true, and as though he would be glad to give me a few pointers, which, indeed, not much later on, he did\u2014and told me he\u2019d be all right and went downstairs and got into his car, switched on the motor and drove off into the soft Alabama night. There was no hint of defiance or bravado in his manner. Only, when I made my halting observation concerning his safety, a shade of sorrow crossed his face, deep, impatient, dark; then it was gone. It was the most impersonal anguish I had ever seen on a man\u2019s face. It was as though he were wrestling with the mighty fact that the danger in which he stood was as nothing compared to the spiritual horror which drove those who were trying to destroy him. They endangered him, but they doomed themselves.","He was fond of saying that, since to be in prison was simply not to live, the death penalty was the only merciful verdict any jury could deliver.","White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this\u2014which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never\u2014the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed. People","SOMEONE ONCE SAID TO ME that the people in general cannot bear very much reality. He meant by this that they prefer fantasy to a truthful re-creation of their experience.","We cannot be free until they are free.","He had been been patting his handkerchief between his palms; now he opened his handkerchief and reached out and wiped my forehead. \\"You\'re all I\'ve got,\\" he said then, with a shy, pained grin. \\"Be careful.\\"\\"Daddy,\\" I said. And began to cry. And if speaking had been agony, this was worse and yet I could not stop.And my father\'s face changed. It became terribly old and at the same time absolutely helplessly young ...\\"Don\'t cry,\\" he said, \\"don\'t cry.","Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have. . . . One . . . ought to earn one\'s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life.","You get so used to being hit you find you\'re always waiting for it. (...) How can I say what it feels like? I don\'t know. I know everybody\'s in trouble and nothing is easy, but how can I explain to you what it feels like to be black when I don\'t understand it and don\'t want to and spend all my time trying to forget it? I don\'t want to hate anybody - but now maybe, I can\'t love anybody either - are we friends? Can we really be friends?","I wanted children. I wanted to be inside again, with the light and safety, with my manhood unquestioned, watching my woman put my children to bed. I wanted the same bed at night and the same arms and I wanted to rise in the morning, knowing where I was. I wanted a woman to be for me a steady ground, like the earth itself, where I could always be renewed.","But it\'s not possible to forget anybody you were that hung up on, who was that hung up on you. You can\'t forget anything that hurt so badly, went so deep, and changed the world forever. It\'s not possible to forget anybody you\'ve destroyed.","I have known both of you all your lives, have carried your Daddy in my arms and on my shoulders, kissed and spanked him and watched him learn to walk. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve known anybody from that far back; if you\u2019ve loved anybody that long, first as an infant, then as a child, then as a man, you gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort. Other people cannot see what I see whenever I look into your father\u2019s face, for behind your father\u2019s face as it is today are all those other faces which were his. Let him laugh and I see a cellar your father does not remember and a house he does not remember and I hear in his present laughter his laughter as a child. Let him curse and I remember him falling down the cellar steps, and howling, and I remember, with pain, his tears, which my hand or your grandmother\u2019s so easily wiped away. But no one\u2019s hand can wipe away those tears he sheds invisibly today, which one hears in his laughter and in his speech and in his songs.","And this was perhaps the first time in my life that death occurred to me as a reality. I thought of the people before me who had looked down at the river and gone to sleep beneath it. I wondered about them. I wondered how they had done it \u2014 it, the physical act. I had thought of suicide when I was much younger, as, possibly, we all have, but then it would have been for revenge, it would have been my way of informing the world how awfully it had made me suffer. But the silence of the evening, as I wandered home, had nothing to do with that storm, that far-off boy. I simply wondered about the dead because their days had ended and I did not know how I would get through mine.","This innocent country set you down in a ghetto in which, in fact, it intended that you should perish. Let me spell out precisely what I mean by that, for the heart of the matter is here, and the root of my dispute with my country. You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason.","Negroes in this country\u2014and Negroes do not, strictly or legally speaking, exist in any other\u2014are taught really to despise themselves from the moment their eyes open on the world. This world is white and they are black. White people hold the power, which means that they are superior to blacks (intrinsically, that is: God decreed it so), and the world has innumerable ways of making this difference known and felt and feared. Long before the Negro child perceives this difference, and even longer before he understands it, he has begun to react to it, he has begun to be controlled by it. Every effort made by the child\u2019s elders to prepare him for a fate from which they cannot protect him causes him secretly, in terror, to begin to await, without knowing that he is doing so, his mysterious and inexorable punishment.","Not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.","Then John knew that a curse was renewed from moment to moment, from father to son. Time was indifferent, like snow and ice; but the heart, crazed wanderer in the driving waste, carried the curse forever.","What a long way, I thought, I\'ve come \u2014 to be destroyed!","To act is to commit, and to commit is to take risks.","ended Elizabeth\u2019s","It seemed to me, of course, that it was a very long funeral. But it was, if anything, a rather shorter funeral than most, nor, since there were no overwhelming, uncontrollable expressions of grief, could it be called\u2014if I dare to use the word\u2014successful. The minister who preached my father\u2019s funeral sermon was one of the few my father had still been seeing as he neared his end. He presented to us in his sermon a man whom none of us had ever seen\u2014a man thoughtful, patient, and forbearing, a Christian inspiration to all who knew him, and a model for his children. And no doubt the children, in their disturbed and guilty state, were almost ready to believe this; he had been remote enough to be anything and, anyway, the shock of the incontrovertible, that it was really our father lying up there in that casket, prepared the mind for anything. His sister moaned and this grief-stricken moaning was taken as corroboration. The other faces held a dark, non-committal thoughtfulness. This was not the man they had known, but they had scarcely expected to be confronted with him; this was, in a sense deeper than questions of fact, the man they had not known, and the man they had not known may have been the real one. The real man, whoever he had been, had suffered and now he was dead: this was all that was sure and all that mattered now. Every man in the chapel hoped that when his hour came he, too, would be eulogized, which is to say forgiven, and that all of his lapses, greeds, errors, and strayings from the truth would be invested with coherence and looked upon with charity. This was perhaps the last thing human beings could give each other and it was what they demanded, after all, of the Lord.","Something very sinister happens to the people of a country when they begin to distrust their own reactions as deeply as they do here, and become as joyless as they have become. It is this individual uncertainty on the part of white American men and women, this inability to renew themselves at the fountain of their own lives, that makes the discussion, let alone elucidation, of any conundrum\u2014that is, any reality\u2014so supremely difficult. The person who distrusts himself has no touchstone for reality\u2014for this touchstone can be only oneself. Such a person interposes between himself and reality nothing less than a labyrinth of attitudes. And these attitudes, furthermore, though the person is usually unaware of it (is unaware of so much!), are historical and public attitudes. They do not relate to the present anymore than they relate to the person.","I had never seen the love and respect that men can have for each other. I\'ve had time since to think about it. I think that the first time a woman sees this--though I was not yet a woman--she sees it, first of all, only because she loves the man: she could not possibly see it otherwise.","It is not too much to say that whoever wishes to become a truly moral human being (and let us not ask whether or not this is possible; I think we must believe that it is possible) must first divorce himself from all the prohibitions, crimes, and hypocrisies of the Christian church.","Not everything that is faced can be changed but nothing can be changed unless it is faced.","I\'m going to pray God, said John\u2014and his voice shook, whether with joy or grief he could not say\u2014\u201cto keep me, and make me strong ... to stand ... to stand against the enemy ... and against everything and everybody ... that wants to cut down my soul.\u201d","Whatever the Europeans may actually think of artists, they have killed enough of them off by now to know that they are as real-and as persistent- as rain, snow, taxes or businessmen.","There is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you. The really terrible thing, old buddy, is that you must accept them. And I mean that very seriously. You must accept them and accept them with love. For these innocent people have no other hope. They are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it.","One writes out of one thing only \u2014 one\u2019s own experience. Everything depends on the how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give. This is the only real concern of the artist, to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art.- Autobiographical Notes","The fact that their [the flower children\'s] uniforms and their jargons precisely represented the distances they had yet to cover before arriving at that maturity which makes love possible\u2014or no longer possible\u2014could not be considered their fault. They had been born into a society in which nothing was harder to achieve, in which perhaps nothing was more scorned and feared than the idea of the soul\'s maturity.","I don\'t know, now, when I first looked at Hella and found her stale, found her body uninteresting, her presence grating. It seemed to happen all at once-- I suppose that only means that it had been happening for a long time. I trace it to something as fleeting as the tip of her beast lightly touching my forearm as she leaned over me to serve my supper. I felt my flesh recoil. Her underclothes, drying in the bathroom, which I had often thought of as sell even rather improbably sweet and as being washed much too often, now began to seem unaesthetic and unclean. A body which had to be covered with such crazy, catty-cornered bits of stuff began to seem grotesque. I sometimes watched her naked body move and wished that it were harder and firmer, I was fantastically intimidated by her breasts, and when I entered her I began to feel that I would never get out alive. All that once delighted me seemed to have turned sour on my stomach.","I am proud of these people not because of their colour but because of their intelligenceand their spiritual force and their beauty.","Furthermore, those beneath the Western heel, unlike those within the West, are aware that Germany\u2019s current role in Europe is to act as a bulwark against the \u201cuncivilized hordes, and since power is what the powerless want, they understand very well what we of the West want to keep, and are not deluded by our talk of a freedom that we have never been willing to share with them.\u201d","The crowd seemed to swallow this theology with no effort\u2014all crowds do swallow theology this way, I gather, in both sides of Jerusalem, in Istanbul, and in Rome\u2014and, as theology goes, it was no more indigestible than the more familiar brand asserting that there is a curse on the sons of Ham. No more, and no less, and it had been designed for the same purpose; namely, the sanctification of power.","In benighted, incompetent Africa, I had never encountered an orphan: the American streets resembled nothing so much as one vast, howling, unprecedented orphanage. It has been vivid to me for many years that what we call a race problem here is not a race problem at all: to keep calling it that is a way of avoiding the problem. The problem is rooted in the question of how one treats one\'s flesh and blood, especially one\'s children.","We are certainly in it now, and it may get worse. It will, certainly - and now something almost as hard to catch as a whisper in a crowded place, as light and as definite as a spider\'s web, strikes below my ribs, stunning and astonishing my heart - get worse. But that light tap, that kick, that signal, announces to me that what can get worse can get better. Yes. It will get worse. But the baby, turning for the first time in its incredible veil of water, announces its presence and claims me; tells me, in that instant, that what can get worse can get better; and that what can get better can get worse. In the meantime - forever - it is entirely up to me. The baby cannot get here without me. And, while I may have known this, in one way, a little while ago, now the baby knows it, and tells me that while it will certainly be worse, once it leaves the water, what gets worse can also get better. It will be in the water for a while yet: but it is preparing itself for a transformation. And so much I.I said, \\"It\'s all right. I\'m not afraid.","America is God\u2019s gift to anybody\u2014if it is, God\u2019s days have got to be numbered.

We did not move, because we could not. We held each other so close that we might indeed have been one body.","For I am\u2014or I was\u2014one of those people who pride themselves on their willpower, on their ability to make a decision and carry it through. This virtue, like most virtues, is ambiguity itself. People who believe that they are strong-willed and the masters of their destiny can only continue to believe this by becoming specialists in self-deception. Their decisions are not really decisions at all\u2014a real decision makes one humble, one knows that it is at the mercy of more things than can be named\u2014but elaborate systems of evasion, of illusion, designed to make themselves and the world appear to be what they and the world are not.","People make you pay for the way you look, which is also the way you think you look, and what time writes in a human face is the record of that collision.","People who cannot suffer can never grow up, can never discover who they are.","She danced out into the aisle, beautiful with a beauty unbearable, graceful with grace that poured from heaven.","For my part, the fate of the Jews, and the world\u2019s indifference to it, frightened me very much. I could not but feel, in those sorrowful years, that this human indifference, concerning which I knew so much already, would be my portion on the day that the United States decided to murder its Negroes systematically instead of little by little and catch-as-catch-can. I was, of course, authoritatively assured that what had happened to the Jews in Germany could not happen to the Negroes in America, but I thought, bleakly, that the German Jews had probably believed similar counsellors, and, again, I could not share the white man\u2019s vision of himself for the very good reason that white men in America do not behave toward black men the way they behave toward each other. When a white man faces a black man, especially if the black man is helpless, terrible things are revealed. I know. I have been carried into precinct basements often enough, and I have seen and heard and endured the secrets of desperate white men and women, which they knew were safe with me, because even if I should speak, no one would believe me. And they would not believe me precisely because they would know that what I said was true.","You do, sometimes, remind of the kind of man who is tempted to put himself in prison in order to avoid being hit by a car.","We human beings now have the power to exterminate ourselves; this seems to be the entire sum of our achievement.","Quelqu\'un, dit Jacques, mon p\xe8re ou le tien, aurait d\xfb nous dire que peu de gens sont jamais morts d\'amour.

It was several years ago. I was still in my teens, he was about my age, give or take a year. He was a very nice boy, too, very quick and dark, and always laughing. For a while he was my best friend. Later, the idea that such a person could have been my best friend was proof of some horrifying taint in me. So I forgot him. But I see him very well tonight.","If you cross the Sahara, and you fall, by and by vultures circle around you, smelling, sensing, your death. They circle lower and lower: they wait. They know. They know exactly when the flesh is ready, when the spirit cannot fight back. The poor are always crossing the Sahara. And the lawyers and bondsmen and all that crowd circle around the poor, exactly like vultures. Of course, they\'re not any richer than the poor, really, that\'s why they\'ve turned into vultures, scavengers, indecent garbage men, and I\'m talking about the black cats, too, who, in so many ways, are worse.","The treatment accorded the Negro during the Second World War marks, for me, a turning point in the Negro\u2019s relation to America. To put it briefly, and somewhat too simply, a certain hope died, a certain respect for white Americans faded. One began to pity them, or to hate them. You must put yourself in the skin of a man who is wearing the uniform of his country, is a candidate for death in its defense, and who is called a \u201cnigger by his comrades-in-arms and his officers; who is almost always given the hardest, ugliest, most menial work to do; who knows that the white G.I. has informed the Europeans that he is subhuman (so much for the American male\u2019s sexual security); who does not dance at the U.S.O. the night white soldiers dance there, and does not drink in the same bars white soldiers drink in; and who watches German prisoners of war being treated by Americans with more human dignity than he has ever received at their hands. And who, at the same time, as a human being, is far freer in a strange land than he has ever been at home. Home! The very word begins to have a despairing and diabolical ring. You must consider what happens to this citizen, after all he has endured, when he returns\u2014home: search, in his shoes, for a job, for a place to live; ride, in his skin, on segregated buses; see, with his eyes, the signs saying \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cColored,\u201d and especially the signs that say \u201cWhite Ladies\u201d and \u201cColored Women\u201d; look into the eyes of his wife; look into the eyes of his son; listen, with his ears, to political speeches, North and South; imagine yourself being told to \u201cwait.\u201d And all this is happening in the richest and freest\u201d","[...] I felt in her marvellously living body the possibility of legitimate surrender.","all men were like this, their thoughts rose no higher, and they lived only to gratify on the bodies of women their brutal and humiliating needs.

Most people guard and keep; they suppose that it is they themselves and what they identify with themselves that they are guarding and keeping, whereas what they are actually guarding and keeping is their system of reality and what they assume themselves to be. One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself\u2014that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving. And, after all, one can give freedom only by setting someone free.","I walked over to her and put my head on her breast.

That","When Malcolm X, who is considered the movement\u2019s second-in-command, and heir apparent, points out that the cry of \u201cviolence was not raised, for example, when the Israelis fought to regain Israel, and, indeed, is raised only when black men indicate that they will fight for their rights, he is speaking the truth. The conquests of England, every single one of them bloody, are part of what Americans have in mind when they speak of England\u2019s glory. In the United States, violence and heroism have been made synonymous except when it comes to blacks, and the only way to defeat Malcolm\u2019s point is to concede it and then ask oneself why this is so. Malcolm\u2019s statement is not answered by references to the triumphs of the N.A.A.C.P., the more particularly since very few liberals have any notion of how long, how costly, and how heartbreaking a task it is to gather the evidence that one can carry into court, or how long such court battles take. Neither is it answered by references to the student sit-in-movement, if only because not all Negroes are students and not all of them live in the South. I, in any case, certainly refuse to be put in the position of denying the truth of Malcolm\u2019s statements simply because I disagree with his conclusions, or in order to pacify the liberal conscience. Things are as bad as the Muslims say they are\u2014in fact, they are worse, and the Muslims do not help matters\u2014but there is no reason that black men should be expected to be more patient, more forbearing, more farseeing than whites; indeed, quite the contrary. The real reason that nonviolence is considered to be a virtue in Negroes\u2014I am not speaking now of its racial value, another matter altogether\u2014is that white men do not want their lives, their self-image, or their property threatened. One wishes they would say so more often. At the end of a television program on which Malcolm X and I both appeared, Malcolm was stopped by a white member of the audience who said, \u201cI have a thousand dollars and an acre of land. What\u2019s going to happen to me?\u201d I admired the directness of the man\u2019s question, but I didn\u2019t hear Malcolm\u2019s reply, because I was trying to explain to someone else that the situation of the Irish a hundred years ago and the situation of the Negro today cannot very usefully be compared.\u201d","The author must \\"rob us of our myths, and give us our history, which will destroy our attitudes and give us back or personalities.","Fonny had found something that he could do, that he wanted to do, and this saved him from the death that was waiting to overtake the children of our age.

It is this individual uncertainty on the part of white American men and women, this inability to renew themselves at the fountain of their own lives, that makes the discussion, let alone elucidation, of any conundrum\u2014that is, any reality\u2014so supremely difficult.

Rumor, flowing immediately to the streets outside, stated that the soldier had been shot in the back, an instantaneous and revealing invention, and that the soldier had died protecting a Negro woman. The facts were somewhat different\u2014for example, the soldier had not been shot in the back, and was not dead, and the girl seems to have been as dubious a symbol of womanhood as her white counterpart in Georgia usually is, but no one was interested in the facts. They preferred the invention because this invention expressed and corroborated their hates and fears so perfectly. It is just as well to remember that people are always doing this. Perhaps many of those legends, including Christianity, to which the world clings began their conquest of the world with just some such concerted surrender to distortion.","We\u2019re going to sit down somewhere until this rush hour\u2019s over.

But it is not enough to be a liberal, to have the right attitudes and even to give money to the right causes. You have to know more than that. You have to be prepared to risk more than that. I am telling you this because I have watched what happened to many of my liberal friends when the civil rights movement was in Alabama, let us say, in the Deep South, and they were very indignant. And then I watched what happened imperceptibly but fatally when the same movement moved north to Brooklyn, to Pittsburgh, Detroit, and New York. And their attitudes changed. I really have to put it to you that way, but that is what happened. Their attitudes changed because they began to feel more and more threatened, and a liberal facade or even a liberal attitude was not enough to deal with the speed with which the movement was moving and the complications of American life as revealed in the fact by the interracial tensions in every major city, and being liberal was no defense against that and no interpretation of that.","All doormen, for example, and policemen have by now, for me, become exactly the same, and my style with them is designed simply to intimidate them before they can intimidate me.

Furthermore, the white man knows his history, knows himself to be a devil, and knows that his time is running out, and all his technology, psychology, science, and \u201ctricknology\u201d are being expended in the effort to prevent black men from hearing the truth. This truth is that at the very beginning of time there was not one white face to be found in all the universe. Black men ruled the earth and the black man was perfect. This is the truth concerning the era that white men now refer to as prehistoric. They want black men to believe that they, like white men, once lived in caves and swung from trees and ate their meat raw and did not have the power of speech. But this is not true. Black men were never in such a condition. Allah allowed the Devil, through his scientists, to carry on infernal experiments, which resulted, finally, in the creation of the devil known as the white man, and later, even more disastrously, in the creation of the white woman. And it was decreed that these monstrous creatures should rule the earth for a certain number of years\u2014I forget how many thousand, but, in any case, their rule now is ending, and Allah, who had never approved of the creation of the white man in the first place (who knows him, in fact, to be not a man at all but a devil), is anxious to restore the rule of peace that the rise of the white man totally destroyed. There is thus, by definition, no virtue in white people, and since they are another creation entirely and can no more, by breeding, become black than a cat, by breeding, can become a horse, there is no hope for them.\u201d","The world of literature came knock-knock-knocking on James Baldwin\u2019s door early: Reading and rereading Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin before he was ten.

Frederick Douglass Junior High School, where he would study with Countee Cullen (\u201c To make a poet black, and bid him sing!), by then the author of two volumes of poetry. Surely, for Baldwin, already the idea of being a writer, for a black man, was a tangible, possible thing.\u201d","Being in trouble can have a funny effect on the mind.

That men have an enormous need to debase other men\u2014and only because they are men\u2014is a truth which history forbids us to labor. And it is absolutely certain that white men, who invented the nigger\u2019s big black prick, are still at the mercy of this nightmare, and are still, for the most part, doomed, in one way or another, to attempt to make this prick their own: so much for the progress which the Christian world has made from that jungle in which it is their clear intention to keep black men treed forever.","\xc9l no era el negro de nadie.

In the beginning\u2014and neither can this be overstated\u2014a Negro just cannot believe that white people are treating him as they do; he does not know what he has done to merit it. And when he realizes that the treatment accorded him has nothing to do with anything he has done, that the attempt of white people to destroy him\u2014for that is what it is\u2014is utterly gratuitous, it is not hard for him to think of white people as devils.

The privacy of his experience, which is only beginning to be recognized in language, and which is denied or ignored in official and popular speech\u2014hence the Negro idiom\u2014lends credibility to any system that pretends to clarify it. And, in fact, the truth about the black man, as a historical entity and as a human being, has been hidden from him, deliberately and cruelly; the power of the white world is threatened whenever a black man refuses to accept the white world\u2019s definitions.

The kids are home from school. The men are home from work. You\'d think that this might be a very happy get together, but it isn\'t. The kids see the men. The men see the kids. And this drives the women, who are cooking and cleaning and straightening hair and who see what men won\'t see, almost crazy. You can see it in the streets, you can hear it in the way the women yell for their children. You can see it in the way they come down out of the house - in a rush, like a storm - and slap the children and drag them upstairs, you can hear it in the child, you can see it in the way the men, ignoring all this, stand together in front of a railing, sit together in the barbershop, pass a bottle between them, walk to the corner to the bar, tease the girl behind the bar, fight with each other, and get very busy, later, with their vines. Saturday afternoon is like a cloud hanging over, it\'s like waiting for a storm to break.But, on Sunday mornings the clouds have lifted, the storm has done its damage and gone. No matter what the damage was, everybody\'s clean now. The women have somehow managed to get it all together, to hold everything together. So, here everybody is, cleaned, scrubbed, brushed, and greased. Later, they\'re going to eat ham hocks or chitterlings or fried or roasted chicken, with yams and rice and greens or combread or biscuits. They\'re going to come home and fall out and be friendly: and some men wash their cars, on Sundays, more carefully than they wash their fo\xadreskins.","Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have.

To be sensual, I think, is to respect and to rejoice in the force of life, of life itself, and to be present in all that one does, from the effort of loving to the breaking of bread.

I think that the first time a woman sees this\u2014though I was not yet a woman\u2014she sees it, first of all, only because she loves the man: she could not possibly see it otherwise. It can be a very great revelation. And, in this fucked up time and place, many women, perhaps most women, feel, in this warmth and energy, a threat. They think that they feel locked out. The truth is that they sense themselves in the presence, so to speak, of a language which they cannot decipher and therefore cannot manipulate, and, however they make a thing about it, so far from being locked out, are appalled by the apprehension that they are, in fact, forever locked in.","All during the trip home David seemed preoccupied.

Was it destined to be lost, or could we have saved it?","You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason. The limits of your ambition were, thus, expected to be set forever. You were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity, and in as many ways as possible, that you were a worthless human being. You were not expected to aspire to excellence: you were expected to make peace with mediocrity. Wherever you have turned, James, in your short time on this earth, you have been told where you could go and what you could do (and how you could do it) and where you could live and whom you could marry. I know your countrymen do not agree with me about this, and I hear them saying, \u201cYou exaggerate. They do not know Harlem, and I do. So do you. Take no one\u2019s word for anything, including mine\u2014but trust your experience. Know whence you came. If you know whence you came, there is really no limit to where you can go. The details and symbols of your life have been deliberately constructed to make you believe what white people say about you. Please try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do and cause you to endure, does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear.\u201d","I ached abruptly, intolerably, with a longing to go home; not that hotel, in one of the alleys of Paris, where the concierge barred the way with my unpaid bill; but home, home across the ocean, to things and people I knew and understood; to those things, those places, those people which I would always helplessly, and in whatever bitterness of spirit, love above all else.","What others did was their responsibility, for which they would answer when the judgment trumpet sounded. But what I did was my responsibility, and I would have to answer too","He lived, now, in time, with the roar and the stink and the beauty and the horror of innumerable men: he had been dropped onto this inferno in the twinkling of an eye.","To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious, is to be in a rage almost all the time. So that the first problem is how to control that rage so that it won\'t destroy you. Part of the rage is this: it isn\'t only what is happening to you, but it\'s what\'s happening all around you all of the time, in the face of the most extraordinary and criminal indifference, the indifference and ignorance of the most white people in this country.","It seems to me that the truth about us, as individual men and women and as a nation, has been and is being recorded, whether we wish to read it or not. Perhaps we cannot read it now, but the day is coming when we will have nothing else to read. The younger writers, so relentlessly and unfavorably compared to their elders, are nevertheless their descendants and are under the obligation to go further than their elders went. It is the only way to keep faith with them. The real difficulty is that those very same questions, that same anguish, must now be expressed in a way that more closely corresponds to our actual condition.","Black is a tremendous spiritual condition, one of the greatest challenges anyone alive can face \u2013\xa0this is what the blacks are saying. Nothing is easier, nor, for the guilt-ridden American, more inevitable, than to dismiss this as chauvinism in reverse. But, in this, white Americans are being \u2013\xa0it is a part of their fate \u2013inaccurate. To be liberated from the stigma of blackness by embracing it is to cease, forever, one\'s interior agreement and collaboration with the authors of one\u2019s degradation. It abruptly reduces the white enemy to a contest merely physical, which he can win only physically. White men have killed black men for refusing to say, \u201cSir: but it was the corroboration of their worth and their power that they wanted, and not the corpse, still less the staining blood. When the black man\u2019s mind is no longer controlled but he white man\u2019s fantasies, a new balance of what may be described as an unprecedented inequality begins to make itself felt: for the white man no longer knows who he is, whereas the black man knows them both. For if it is difficult to be released from the stigma of blackness, it is clearly at least equally difficult to surmount the delusion of whiteness. And as the black glories in his newfound color, which is his at last, and asserts, not always with the very greatest politeness, the unanswerable validity and power of his being \u2013\xa0even in the shadow of death \u2013\xa0the white is very often fronted and very often made afraid. He has his reasons, after all, not only for being weary of the entire concept of color, but fearful as to what may be made of this concept once it has fallen, as it were, into the wrong hands.\u201d","It is very nearly impossible . . . to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind. --\u201cThey Can\u2019t Turn Back, in Mademoiselle (New York, Aug. 1960; repr. in The Price of the Ticket, 1985) \xa0 \xa0 The\u201d","We will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos,crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques,armies, flags, & nations; in order to denythe fact of death, which is the only fact we have.It seems to me one should rejoice in the fact of death,one out to decide indeed to earn one\'s deathby confronting with passion, the conundrum of life.One is responsible to life.

And this was partly because I knew that it did not really matter anymore; it did not even matter if I never spoke to Giovanni again; for they had become visible, as visible as the wafers on the shirt of the flaming princess, they stormed all over me, my awakening, my insistent possibilities.","I have known both of you all your lives, have carried your Daddy in my arms and on my shoulders, kissed and spanked him and watched him learn to walk. I don\'t know if you\'ve known anybody from that far back; if you\'ve loved anybody that long, first as an infant, then as a child, then as a man, you gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort. Other people cannot see what I see whenever I look into your father\'s face, for behind your father\'s face as it is today are all those other faces which were his. Let him laugh and I see a cellar your father does not remember and a house he does not remember and I hear in his present laughter his laughter as a child. Let him curse and I remember him falling down the cellar steps, and howling, and I remember, with pain, his tears, which my hand or your grandmother\'s so easily wiped away. But no one\'s hand can wipe away those tears he sheds invisibly today, which one hears in his laughter and in his speech and in his songs. I know what the world has done to my brother and how narrowly he has survived it. And I know, which is much worse, and this is the crime of which I accuse my country and my countrymen, and for which neither I nor time nor history will ever forgive them, that they have destroyed and are destroying hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it.","If I spend weeks and months avoiding my typewriter\u2014and I do, sharpening pencils, trying to avoid going where I know I\u2019ve got to go\u2014then one has got to use this to learn humility. After all, there is a kind of saving egotism too, a cruel and dangerous but also saving egotism, about the artist\u2019s condition, which is this: I know that if I survive it, when the tears have stopped flowing or when the blood has dried, when the storm has settled, I do have a typewriter which is my torment but is also my work. If I can survive it, I can always go back there, and if I\u2019ve not turned into a total liar, then I can use it and prepare myself in this way for the next inevitable and possibly fatal disaster.

The lives of men \u2014 and, therefore, of nations \u2014 to an extent literally unimaginable, depend on how vividly this question lives in the mind.

However immoral or subversive this may sound to some, it is the writer who must always remember that morality, if it is to remain or become morality, must be perpetually examined, cracked, changed, made new. He must remember, however powerful the many who would rather forget, that life is the only touchstone and that life is dangerous, and that without the joyful acceptance of this danger, there can never be any safety for anyone, ever, anywhere.","We\'re all bastards.

These artists, in their very different ways, sing a kind of universal blues, they speak of something far beyond their charts, graphs, statistics, they are telling us something about what it is like to be alive. It is not self-pity which one hears in them, but compassion. And perhaps this is the place for me to say that I really do not, at the very bottom of my own mind, compare myself to other writers. I think I really helplessly model myself on jazz musicians and try to write the way they sound. I am not an intellectual, not in the dreary sense that word is used today, and do not want to be: I am aiming at what Henry James called \u201cperception at the pitch of passion.","The love and the laughter come from the same place: but not many people go there.","And, in fact, the truth about the black man, as a historical entity and as a human being, has been hidden from him, deliberately and cruelly; the power of the white world is threatened whenever a black man refuses to accept the white world\u2019s definitions","We live in a country in which words are mostly used to cover the sleeper, not to wake him up; and therefore, it seems to me, the adulation so cruelly proffered our elders has nothing to do with their achievement\u2014which, I repeat, was mighty\u2014but has to do with our impulse to look back on what we now imagine to have been a happier time.

Their concept of entertainment is difficult to distinguish from the use of narcotics. To watch the TV screen for any length of time is to learn some really frightening things about the American sense of reality. We are cruelly trapped between what we would like to be and what we actually are. And we cannot possibly become what we would like to be until we are willing to ask ourselves just why the lives we lead on this continent are mainly so empty, so tame, and so ugly.

I do not think I will ever love anyone like that again.","Coming back to Paris,\' she said, after a moment, \'is always so lovely, no matter where you\'ve been.\'We got into a cab and our driver made a wide, reckless circle into the stream of traffic.\u2018I should think that even if you returned here in some awful sorrow you might, well, you might find it posible here to begin to be reconciled\u2019.\'Let\'s hope,\' I said, \'that we never have to put Paris to that test.","My soul is a witness for my Lord. There was an awful silence at the bottom of John\'s mind, a dreadful weight, a dreadful speculation. And not even a speculation, but a deep, deep turning, as of something huge, black, shapeless, for ages dead on the ocean floor, that now felt its rest disturbed by a faint, far wind, which bid it: \'Arise","We are controlled here by our confusion, far more than we know, and the American dream has therefore become something much more closely resembling a nightmare, on the private, domestic, and international levels. Privately, we cannot stand our lives and dare not examine them; domestically, we take no responsibility for (and no pride in) what goes on in our country; and, internationally, for many millions of people, we are an unmitigated disaster. Whoever doubts this last statement has only to open his ears, his heart, his mind, to the testimony of\u2014for example\u2014any Cuban peasant or any Spanish poet, and ask himself what he would feel about us if he were the victim of our performance in pre-Castro Cuba or in Spain.","I loved my country, but I could not respect it, could not, upon my soul, be reconciled to my country as it was. And I loved my work, had great respect for the craft which I was compelled to study, and wanted it to have some human use. It was beginning to be clear to me that these two loves might, never, in my life, be reconciled: no man can serve two masters.","Era imposible comprar tiempo. La \xfanica moneda que el tiempo acepta es la vida.","Tell me,\' he said, \'what is this thing about time? Why is it better to be late than early? People are always saying, we must wait, we must wait. What are they waiting for?","And they didn\'t even read; depressed populations don\'t have the time or energy to spare. The affluent populations, which should have been their help, didn\'t as far as could be discovered, read, either--they merely bought books and devoured them, but not in order to learn: in order to learn new attitudes.","it became a stranger\u2019s face\u2014or it made meso guilty to look on him that I wished it were a stranger\u2019s face. Not allmy memorizing had prepared me for the metamorphosis which mymemorizing had helped to bring about.","Je n\u2019\xe9tais pas boxeur, je n\u2019\xe9tais pas beau, je n\u2019\xe9tais pas chanteur, je n\u2019\xe9tais pas danseur j\u2019\xe9tais dr\xf4lement coinc\xe9 la seul chose que j\u2019ai pens\xe9 est que peut-\xeatre je pouvais \xeatre \xe9crivain","The states of birth, suffering, love and death, are extreme states: extreme, universal, and inescapable. We all know this, but we would rather not know it. The artist is present to correct the delusions to which we fall prey in our attempts to avoid this knowledge.It is for this reason that all societies have battled with that incorrigible disturber of peace \u2013 the artist. I doubt that future societies will get on with him any better. The entire purpose of society is to create a bulwark against the inner and the outer chaos, literally, in order to make life bearable and to keep the human race alive. And it is absolutely inevitable that when a tradition has been evolved, whatever the tradition is, that the people, in general will suppose it to have existed from before the beginning of time and will be most unwilling and indeed unable to conceive of any changes in it. They do not know how they will live without those traditions which have given them their identity. Their reaction, when it is suggested that they can or that they must, is panic. And we see this panic, I think, everywhere in the world today, from the streets of our own New Orleans to the grisly battleground of Algeria. And a higher level of consciousness among the people is the only hope we have, now or in the future, of minimizing the human damage.","This is why the most dangerous creation of any society is that man who has nothing to lose.","I sometimes think, with despair, that Americans will swallow whole any political speech whatever\u2014we\u2019ve been doing very little else, these last, bad years","Well, isn\u2019t it true? You don\u2019t have a home until you leave it and then, when you have left it, you never can go back.","Youwant to leave Giovanni because he makes you stink. You want to despiseGiovanni because he is not afraid of the stink of love. You want to killhim in the name of all your lying little moralities. And you\u2014you areimmoral. You are, by far, the most immoral man I have met in all mylife. Look, look what you have done to me. Do you think you could havedone this if I did not love you? Is this what you should do to love?","But the aims of life are antithetical to those of the dreamer, and the teeth of the world are sharp.","What it comes to is that if we - who can scarcely be considered a white nation - persist in thinking of ourselves as one, we condemn ourselves, with the truly white nations, to sterility and decay. Whereas if we could accept ourselves as we are, we might bring new life to the Western achievements and transform them. The price of this transformation the unconditional freedom of the Negro. It is not too much to say that he - who has been so long rejected - must now be embraced and at no matter what psychic or social risk. He is the key figure in his country, and the American future is precisely as bright or as dark as his.","He was still big, black, and loud; at the age of twenty-three\u2014he is a little older than Fonny\u2014he was already running out of familiar faces.","The tragedy of this country now is that most of the people who say they care about it do not care. What they care about is their safety and their profits. What they care about is not rocking the boat. What they care about is the continuation of white supremacy, so that white liberals who are with you in principle will move out when you move in.","Look, men have been sleeping with men for thousands of years\u2014and raising tribes. This is a Western sickness, it really is. It\u2019s an artificial division. Men will be sleeping with each other when the trumpet sounds. It\u2019s only this infantile culture which has made such a big deal of it.","Touch, but no contact. All touch, but no contact and no light.","All doormen, for example, and all policemen have by now, for me, become exactly the same, and my style with them is designed simply to intimidate them before they can intimidate me. No doubt I am guilty of some injustice here, but it is irreducible, since I cannot risk assuming that the humanity of these people is more real to them than their uniforms.","seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death\u2014ought to decide, indeed, to earn one\u2019s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible to life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return.","This is not a Western idea, but fathers and sons arrive at that relationship only by claiming that relationship: that is, by paying for it. If the relationship of father to son could really be reduced to biology, the whole earth would blaze with the glory of fathers and sons. (But to pursue this further carries us far beyond the confines of the present discussion.)","For this is your home, my friend, do not be driven from it; great men have done great things here, and will again, and we can make America what America must become.","Someone once said to me that the people in general cannot bear very much reality. He meant by this that they prefer fantasy to a truthful recreation of their experience. People have quite enough reality to bear, by simply getting through their lives, raising their children, dealing with the eternal conundrums of birth, taxes, and death.","If I could make you stay, I would, heshouted. \u201cIf I had to beat you, chain you, starve you\u2014if I could makeyou stay, I would.\u201d He turned back into the room; the wind blew hishair.

I know that it ends. I ain\'t going to tell you no lies, like it always ends for the better. Sometimes it ends for the worse. You can suffer so bad that you can be driven to a place where you can\'t ever suffer again: and that\'s worse.","Much has been written of love turning to hatred, of the heart growingcold with the death of love. It is a remarkable process. It is far moreterrible than anything I have ever read about it, more terrible thananything I will ever be able to say.","It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death \u2014 ought to decide, indeed, to earn one\u2019s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life.","I think the country has to find out what it means by freedom. Freedom is a very dangerous thing. Anything else is disastrous. But freedom is dangerous. You\'ve got to make choices. You\'ve got to make very dangerous choices. You\'ve got to be taught that your life is in your hands.","Ah! I am told that New York is very beautiful. Is it more beautiful than Paris?\'\'Oh, no,\' I said, \'no city is more beautiful than Paris\u2019.","Everyone wishes to be loved, but, in the event, nearly no one can bear it. Everyone desires love but also finds it impossible to believe that he deserves it.","the little girl who walked into the Little Rock School House and was spat on was much freer than the white child who sat there with a misconceived notion.","Art has to be a kind of confession. I don\'t mean a true confession in the sense of that dreary magazine.The effort, it seems to me, is: if you can examine and face your life, you can discover the terms with which you are connected to other lives, and they can discover, too, the terms with which they are connected to other people.This has happened to every one of us, I\'m sure. You read something which you thought only happened to you, and you discovered it happened one hundred years ago to Dostoyevsky. This is a very great liberation for the suffering, struggling person, who always thinks that he is alone. This is why art is important. Art would not be important if life were not important, and life *is* important.Most of us, no matter what we say, are walking in the dark, whistling in the dark. Nobody knows what is going to happen to him from one moment to the next, or how one will bear it. This is irreducible. And it\'s true for everybody. Now, it is true that the nature of society is to create, among its citizens, an illusion of safety; but it is also absolutely true that the safety is always necessarily an illusion. Artists are here to disturb the peace.","I do not know many Negroes who are eager to be \u201caccepted by white people, still less to be loved by them; they, the blacks, simply don\u2019t wish to be beaten over the head by the whites every instant of our brief passage on this planet\u201d","That\u2019s what the Blues and Spirituals are all about. It is the ability to look on things as they are and survive your losses, or even not survive them\u2014to know that your losses are coming. To know they are coming is the only possible insurance you have, a faint insurance, that you will survive them.","Prometheus,","Now, there is simply no possibility of a real change in the Negro\u2019s situation without the most radical and far-reaching changes in the American political and social structure. And it is clear that white Americans are not simply unwilling to effect these changes; they are, in the main, so slothful have they become, unable even to envision them.","dismiss white people as the slightly mad victims of their own brainwashing. One watched the lives they led. One could not be fooled about that; one watched the things they did and the excuses that they gave themselves, and if a white man was really in trouble, deep trouble, it was to the Negro\u2019s door that he came.","And everything was different. I was walking through streets I had never seen before. The faces around me, I had never seen. We moved in silence which was music from everywhere.","Force does not work the way its advocates seem to think it does. It does not, for example, reveal to the victim the strength of his adversary. On the contrary, it reveals the weakness, even the panic of his adversary, and this revelation invests the victim with patience. Furthermore, it is ultimately fatal to create too many victims. The victor can do nothing with these victims, for they do not belong to him, but\u2014to the victims. They belong to the people he is fighting. The people know this, and as inexorably as the roll call\u2014the honor roll\u2014of victims expands, so does their will become inexorable: they resolve that these dead, their brethren, shall not have died in vain. When this point is reached, however long the battle may go on, the victor can never be the victor: on the contrary, all his energies, his entire life, are bound up in a terror he cannot articulate, a mystery he cannot read, a battle he cannot win\u2014he has simply become the prisoner of the people he thought to cow, chain, or murder into submission.","I yet contend that the mobs in the streets of Hitler\'s Germany were those in the streets not by the will of the German state, but by the will of the western world, including those architects of human freedom, the British...","who was saying that no people in history had ever been respected who had not owned their land.

I could not deny the truth of this statement.\u201d","Negroes in this country\u2014and Negroes do not, strictly or legally speaking, exist in any other\u2014are taught really to despise themselves from the moment their eyes open on the world. This world is white and they are black.","I said before that America\u2019s effort to avoid the presence of black people constricts American literature. It creates a trap white writers find themselves in.","You going to need me, baby, one of these cold, rainy days.","I am saying that a journey is called that because you cannot know what you will discover on the journey, what you will do with what you find, or what you find will do to you.","Perhaps he is a fool and a coward but almost everybody is one or the other and most people are both.","I suppose they will come for him early in the morning, perhaps justbefore dawn, so that the last thing Giovanni will ever see will be thatgrey, lightless sky over Paris, beneath which we stumbled homewardtogether so many desperate and drunken mornings.","knew that, according to many Christians, I was a descendant of Ham, who had been cursed, and that I was therefore predestined to be a slave. This had nothing to do with anything I was, or contained, or could become; my fate had been sealed forever, from the beginning of time. And","It is galling indeed to have stood so long, hat in hand, waiting for Americans to grow up enough to realize that you do not threaten them.","Love him,\' said Jacques, with vehemence, \'love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters? And how long, at the best, can it last? since you are both men and still have everywhere to go? Only five minutes, and most of that, h\xe9las! in the dark. And if you think of them as dirty, then they will be dirty - they will be dirty because you will be giving nothing, you will be despising your flesh and his. But you can make your time together anything but dirty; you can give each other something which will make both of you better - forever - if you will not be ashamed, if you will only not play it safe.\' He paused, watching me, and then looked down to his cognac. \'You play it safe long enough,\' he said, in a different tone, \'and you\'ll end up trapped in your own dirty body, forever and forever and forever - like me.","When a dark face opens, light seems to go everywhere.","Men have to think about so many things. Women only have to think about men.","I love a few people and they love me and some of them are white, and isn\u2019t love more important than color?","Every society is really governed by hidden laws, by unspoken but profound assumptions on the part of the people, and ours is no exception. It is up to the American writer to find out what these laws and assumptions are. In a society much given to smashing taboos without thereby managing to be liberated from them, it will be no easy matter.","It was the hour when darkness begins, when the sounds of the night begin.","All of the Western nations have been caught in a lie, the lie of their pretended humanism. This means that their history has no moral justification, and that the West has no moral authority. \\"Vile as I am,\\" states one of the characters in Dostoevsky\'s The Idiot, \\"I don\'t believe in the wagons that bring bread to humanity. For the wagons that bring bread to humanity, may coldly exclude a considerable part of humanity from enjoying what is brought.","But the Irish became white when they got here and began rising in the world, whereas I became black and began sinking.","We moved in a silence which was music from everywhere.","To be with God is really to be involved with some enormous, overwhelming desire, and joy, and power which you cannot control, which controls you. I conceive of my own life as a journey toward something I do not understand, which in the going toward, makes me better. I conceive of God, in fact, as a means of liberation and not a means to control others. Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up. No one in the world\u2014in the entire world\u2014knows more\u2014knows Americans better or, odd as this may sound, loves them more than the American Negro. This is because he has had to watch you, outwit you, deal with you, and bear you, and sometimes even bleed and die with you, ever since we got here, that is, since both of us, black and white, got here\u2014and this is a wedding. Whether I like it or not, or whether you like it or not, we are bound together forever. We are part of each other. What is happening to every Negro in the country at any time is also happening to you. There is no way around this. I am suggesting that these walls\u2014these artificial walls\u2014which have been up so long to protect us from something we fear, must come down.","You are - how old? Twenty-six or seven? I am nearly twice that and, let me tell you, you are lucky. You are lucky that what is happening to you now is happening now and not when you are forty, or something like that, when there would be no hope for you and you would simply be destroyed.","Every effort made by the child\u2019s elders to prepare him for a fate from which they cannot protect him causes him secretly, in terror, to begin to await, without knowing that he is doing so, his mysterious and inexorable punishment. He must be \u201cgood not only in order to please his parents and not only to avoid being punished by them; behind their authority stands another, nameless and\u201d","He had never seen the beauty of black people before. But, staring at Ida, who stood before the window of the Harlem kitchen, seeing that she was no longer merely his younger sister but a girl who would soon be a woman, she became associated with the colors of the shawl, the colors of the sun, and with a splendor incalculably older than the gray stone of the island on which they had been born.","The details and symbols of your life have been deliberately constructed to make you believe what white people say about you.","Men are men, and sometimes they must be left alone.","I feel that I want to be forgiven; I want her to forgive me.But I do not know how to state my crime. My crime, in some odd way, isin being a man and she knows all about this already. It is terrible hownaked she makes me feel, like a half-grown boy, naked before hismother.","We crossed crowded Sixth Avenue, all kinds of people out hunting for Saturday night.","And in Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin we may find foreshadowing of both: the formula created by the necessity to find a lie more palatable than the truth has been handed down and memorized and persists yet with a terrible power.","in fleeing from his body, I confirmed and perpetuated his body\u2019s power over me.","In a society that is entirely hostile, and, by its nature, seems determined to cut you down - that has cut down so many in the past and cuts down so many every day - it begins to be almost impossible to distinguish a real from a fancied injury. One can very quickly cease to attempt this distinction, and, what is worse, one usually ceases to attempt it without realizing that one has done so.","I use the word \u201clove here not merely in the personal sense but as a state of being, or a state of grace\u2014not in the infantile American sense of being made happy but in the tough and universal sense of quest and daring and growth.\u201d","... it was a little bit like being hit by a truck ... but it was the most beautiful thing that ever happened to me.","I think it\'s better to know that you don\'t know, that way you can grow with the mystery as the mystery grows in you. But, these days, of course, everybody knows everything, that\'s why so many people are so lost.","There is still, for me, no pathos quite like the pathos of those multicolored, worn, somehow triumphant and transfigured faces, speaking from the depths of a visible, tangible, continuing despair of the goodness of the Lord.","And if the word integration means anything, this is what it means: that we, with love, shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it.","In my mind, the effort to become a great novelist simply involves attempting to tell as much of the truth as one can bear, and then a little more. It is an effort which, by its very nature\u2014remembering that men write the books, that time passes and energy flags, and safety beckons\u2014is obviously doomed to failure. \u201cSuccess is an American word which cannot conceivably, unless it is defined in an extremely severe, ironical, and painful way, have any place in the vocabulary of any artist.\u201d","You do, sometimes, remind me of the kind of man who is tempted to put himself in prison in order to avoid being hit by a car.","Writers are extremely important people in a country, whether or not the country knows it. The multiple truths about a people are revealed by that people\u2019s artists\u2014that is what the artists are for.","the failure and the betrayal are in the record book forever, and sum up, and condemn, forever, those descendants of a barbarous Europe who arbitrarily and arrogantly reserve the right to call themselves Americans.","Nor can you get a meal anywhere in the South without being confronted with \u201cgrits; a pale, lumpy, tasteless kind of porridge which the Southerner insists is a delicacy but which I believe they ingest as punishment for their sins.\u201d","Me, I want to escape,\' he had told me, \'Je veux m\'evader--this dirty world, this dirty body. I never wish to make love again with anything more than the body.","One cannot argue with anyone\u2019s experience or decision or belief. All my evidence would be thrown out of court as irrelevant to the main body of the case, for I could cite only exceptions. The South Side proved the justice of the indictment; the state of the world proved the justice of the indictment. Everything else, stretching back throughout recorded time, was merely a history of those exceptions who had tried to change the world and had failed.","It is, thus, perfectly possible - indeed, it is common - to act on the genuine results of the event, at the same time that the memory manufactures quite another one, an event totally unrelated to the visible and uncontrollable effects in one\'s life. This may be why we appear to learn absolutely nothing from experience, or may, in other words, account for our incoherence: memory does not require that we reconstitute the event, but that we justify it.","What the times demand, and in an unprecedented fashion, is that one be\u2014not seem\u2014outrageous, independent, anarchical. That one be thoroughly disciplined\u2014as a means of being spontaneous. That one resist at whatever cost the fearful pressures placed on one to lie about one\u2019s own experience. For in the same way that the writer scarcely ever had a more uneasy time, he has never been needed more.","In the eeriest way possible, I suddenly had a glimpse of what white people must go through at a dinner table when they are trying to prove that Negroes are not subhuman. I had almost said, after all, \\"Well, take my friend Mary,\\" and very nearly descended to a catalogue of those virtues that gave Mary the right to be alive. And in what hope? That Elijah and the others would nod their heads solemnly and say, at least, \\"Well, she\'s all right - but the others!"]')}}]);
