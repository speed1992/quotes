The greater the lie, the more readily it will be believed.","Let me control the textbooks, and I will control the state.","What luck, for governments, that the people are stupid!","We have to put a stop to the idea that it is a part of everybody\'s civil rights to say whatever he pleases.","The receptivity of the masses is very limited, their intelligence is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these facts, all effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand by your slogan.","Terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death.","Society\'s needs come before the individuals needs","The state must declare the child to be the most precious treasure of the people. As long as the government is perceived as working for the benefit of the children, the people will happily endure almost any curtailment of liberty and almost any deprivation.","It is not truth that matters, but victory.","If you dont like a Rule... Just Follow it.. Reach on the Top.. and Change the Rule","I don\'t see much future for the Americans ... it\'s a decayed country. And they have their racial problem, and the problem of social inequalities ... my feelings against Americanism are feelings of hatred and deep repugnance ... everything about the behaviour of American society reveals that it\'s half Judaised, and the other half negrified. How can one expect a State like that to hold together?","If the lie is large enough, everyone will believe it.","What good fortune for those in power that people do not think.","When an opponent declares, \\"I will not come over to your side,\\" I calmly say, \\"Your child belongs to us already...What are you? You will pass on. Your descendants, however, now stand in the new camp. In a short time they will know nothing else but this new community.\\"","The great masses of the people will more easily fall victims to a big lie than to a small one.","I use emotion for the many and reserve reason for the few.","National socialism is the determination to create a new man. There will no longer exist any individual arbitrary will, nor realms in which the individual belongs to himself. The time of happiness as a private matter is over.","How fortunate for governments that the people they administer don\'t think.","It is better to make a mistake than to do nothing.","I\'ll put an end to the idea that a woman\'s body belongs to her... Nazi ideals demand that the practice of abortion shall be exterminated with a strong hand.","A woman must be a cute, cuddly, naive little thing - tender, sweet, and stupid.","The one means that wins the easiest victory over reason is terror and force.","By the skillful and sustained use of propaganda, one can make a people see even heaven as hell or an extremely wretched life as paradise.","All propaganda must be confined to a few bare necessities and then must be expressed in a few stereotyped formulas . . . Only constant repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea upon the memory of a crowd.","If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed.","The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subjugated races to possess arms.","To attain our aim we should stop at nothing even if we must join forces with the devil.","I am sure that the Japanese, the Chinese and the peoples of Islam will always be closer to us than, for example, France, in spite of the fact that we are related by blood (...)","When You Are In The Light, Everything \\n Follows You, But When You Enter Into \\n The Dark, Even Your Own Shadow \\n Doesn\'t Follow You.","Life does not forgive weakness.","Our strategy is to destroy the enemy from within, to conquer him through himself.","A man who has no sense of history is like a man who has no ears or no eyes.","Great nations do not succumb through lost wars, but rather through racial decay and the destruction of their internal order.","He alone, who owns the youth, gains the future.","Cruelty impresses, people want to be afraid of something. They want someone to whom they can submit with a shudder, the masses need that. They need something to dreed.","To whom should propaganda be addressed? To the scientifically trained intelligentsia or the less educated masses? It must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses.","What we suffer from today is an excess of education.","The art of leadership . . . consists in consolidating the attention of the people against a single adversary and taking care that nothing will split up that attention. . . . The leader of genius must have the ability to make different opponents appear as if they belong to one category.","The Big Lie is a major untruth uttered frequently by leaders as a means of duping and controlling the constituency.","Life is like a game, there could be many players. If you don\'t play with them, they\'ll play with you.","All propaganda has to be popular and has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reach.","WHAT is America but beauty queens, millionaires, stupid records and Hollywood?","Propaganda must not serve the truth, especially as it might bring out something favorable for the opponent.","Benefit to the community precedes benefit to the individual.","The very first essential for success is a perpetually constant and regular employment of violence.","National Socialism will use its own revolution for establishing of a new world order.","Brutality creates respect.","If you win, you need not have to explain...If you lose, you should not be there to explain!","Demoralize the enemy from within by surprise, terror, sabotage, assassination. This is the war of the future.","Pride in one\'s own race - and that does not imply contempt for other races - is also a normal and healthy sentiment. I have never regarded the Chinese or the Japanese as being inferior to ourselves. They belong to ancient civilizations, and I admit freely that their past history is superior to our own. They have the right to be proud of their past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilization to which we belong. Indeed, I believe the more steadfast the Chinese and the Japanese remain in their pride of race, the easier I shall find it to get on with them.","A highly intelligent man should take a primitive woman. Imagine if on top of everything else, I had a woman who interfered with my work.","Those who want to live, let them fight, and those who do not want to fight in this world of eternal struggle do not deserve to live.","Capitalism and Bolshevism are the two sides of the same international Jewish coin.","You will never learn what I am thinking. And those who boast most loudly that they know my thought, to such people I lie even more.","You see, it\'s been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn\'t we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion [Islam] too would have been more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?","Only force rules. Force is the first law","I am a German nationalist, that means I am openly committed to my Volkstrum. All of my thoughts and actions belong to it. I am a socialist. I see before me no class or rank, but rather a community of people who are connected by blood, united by language, and subject to the same collective fate.","The truth is the best propaganda.","God helps only those who are prepared and determined to help themselves.","An evil exists that threatens every man, woman, and child of this great nation. We must take steps to ensure our domestic security and protect our homeland.","Obstacles do not exist to be surrendered to, but only to be broken.","The victor will never be asked if he told the truth.","Our teachers were absolute tyrants. They had no sympathy with youth; their one object was to stuff our brains and turn us into erudite apes like themselves. If any pupil showed the slightest trace of originality, they persecuted him relentlessly, and the only model pupils whom I have ever got to know have all been failures in after-life.","The work that Christ started but could not finish, I - Adolf Hitler - will conclude.","But the most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly and with unflagging attention. It must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over. Here, as so often in this world, persistence is the first and most important requirement for success.","Sooner will a camel pass through a needle\'s eye than a great man be \\"discovered\\" by an election.","Today we rule Germany, tomorrow, the world.","Only constant repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea on the memory of the crowd.","I want everyone to keep the property that he has acquired for himself according to the principle: benefit to the community precedes benefit to the individual. But the state should retain supervision and each property owner should consider himself appointed by the state. It is his duty not to use his property against the interests of others among his own people. This is the crucial matter. The Third Reich will always retain its right to control the owners of property.","Democracy, the deceitful theory that the Jew would insinuate - namely, that theory that all men are created equal.","I have issued the command, and I\'ll have anybody who utters but one word of criticism executed by a firing squad, that our war aim does not consist in reaching certain lines, but in the physical destruction of the enemy. Accordingly, I have placed my death\'s-head formation in readiness, for the present only in the East, with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space which we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?","I realise that man, in his imperfection, can commit innumerable errors - but to devote myself deliberately to errors, that is something I cannot do. I shall never come personally to terms with the Christian lie. Our epoch, in the next 200 years, will certainly see the end of the disease of Christianity. My regret will have been that I could not behold its demise.","A definite factor in getting a lie believed is the size of the lie. The broad mass of the people, in the simplicity of their hearts, more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a small one.","I was Europe\'s last chance.","Money glitters, beauty sparkles, and intelligence shines.","A decision by the Fuhrer in the express form of a law or a decree may not be scrutinized by a judge. In addition, the judge is bound by any other decision of the Fuhrer.","Humanitarianism is the expression of stupidity and cowardice.","Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest against nature. Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure.","It is always more difficult to fight successfully against Faith than against knowledge.","Your birth may be common, But death must be history.","All propaganda must be so popular and on such an intellectual level, that even the most stupid of those towards whom it is directed will understand it. Therefore, the intellectual level of the propaganda must be lower the larger the number of people who are to be influenced by it.","Pacifism is simply undisguised cowardice.","I do not see why man should not be as cruel as nature","Why nationalize industry when you can nationalize the people?","Woman\'s world is her husband, her family, her children and her home. We do not find it right when she presses into the world of men.","Through clever and constant application of propaganda, people can be made to see paradise as hell, and also the other way round, to consider the most wretched sort of life as paradise.","Besides, there is more that binds us to Bolshevism than separates us from it. There is, above all, genuine, revolutionary feeling, which is alive everywhere in Russia except where there are Jewish Marxists. I have always made allowance for this circumstance, and given orders that former Communists are to be admitted to the party at once. The petit bourgeois Social-Democrat and the trade-union boss will never make a National Socialist, but the Communist always will.","I have not come into this world to make men better, but to make use of their weaknesses.","We stand at the end of the Age of Reason. A new era of the magical explanation of the world is rising.","The [Nazi party] should not become a constable of public opinion, but must dominate it. It must not become a servant of the masses, but their master!","Universal education is the most corroding and disintegrating poison that liberalism has ever invented for its own destruction.","Struggle is gruesome only for the weak.","As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice.","My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior... I am fighting for the work of the Lord.","The day of individual happiness has passed.","The greater the lie, the greater the chance that it will be believed.","When I came to power, I did not want the concentration camps to become old age pensioners homes, but instruments of terror.","Think Thousand times before taking a decision But - After taking decison never turn back even if you get Thousand difficulties!!","Pride in one\'s own race - and that does not imply contempt for other races - is ... a normal and healthy sentiment.","The great strength of the totalitarian state is that it forces those who fear it to imitate it.","We will not capitulate - no, never! We may be destroyed, but if we are, we shall drag a world with us - a world in flames.","I desire a violent, domineering, fearless, and ferocious upcoming generation. It must be able to bear pain. It must show no signs whatsoever of weakness or tenderness. The free and magnificent predator must once again glint from their eyes.","Never in this world can the Jew become master of any people except a bastardized people.","I suggest you to do war but never love because in war either you live or you die. But in love neither you live nor you die.","I am liberating man from the degrading chimera known as `conscience\'.","All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to.","Become strong again in spirit, strong in will, strong in endurance, strong to bear all sacrifices","Life never forgives weaknesses.","Hate is more lasting than dislike.","The Ten Commandments have lost their validity...Conscience is a Jewish invention. It is a blemish like circumcision.","The leader of genius must have the ability to make different opponents appear as if they belonged to one category.","When folk have set before them a true purpose and then pursue it unmoved with bravery and courage, when they withstand with a strong heart every trial which Heaven sends upon them, then one day at the last Almighty Providence will yet grant them the fruits of their struggle and of their sacrifices. For God has never abandoned any man upon this earth unless he has first abandoned himself.","National Socialism is what Marxism might have been if it could have broken its absurd and artificial ties with a democratic order.","The first foundation for the creation of authority is always provided by popularity.","The American president increasingly used his influence to create conflicts, intensify existing conflicts, and, above all, to keep conflicts from being resolved peacefully. For years this man looked for a dispute anywhere in the world, but preferably in Europe, that he could use to create political entanglements with American economic obligations to one of the contending sides, which would then steadily involve America in the conflict and thus divert attention from his own confused domestic economic policies.","It is necessary that I should die for my people; but my spirit will rise from the grave and the whole world will know that I was right.","The size of the lie is a definite factor in causing it to be believed, for the vast masses of the nation are in the depths of their hearts more easily deceived than they are consciously and intentionally bad. The primitive simplicity of their minds renders them a more easy prey to a big lie than a small one, for they themselves often tell little lies but would be ashamed to tell a big one.","Theater, art, literature, cinema, press, posters, and window displays must be cleansed of all manifestations of our rotting world and placed in the service of a moral, political, and cultural idea.","Anyone can deal with victory. Only the mighty can bear defeat.","Strength lies not in defence but in attack","I am beginning with the young. We older ones are used up. Yes, we are old already. We are rotten to the marrow. We have no unrestrained instincts left. We are cowardly and sentimental. We are bearing the burden of a humiliating past, and have in our blood the dull recollection of serfdom and servility. But my magnificent youngsters! Are there finer ones anywhere in the world? Look at these young men and boys! What material! With them, I can make a new world.","Thousands of Americans, Englishmen and Frenchmen have visited Germany during the months after the national revolution and were able to testify as eye-witnesses that there is no country in the world where law and order are better maintained than in present-day Germany.  That there is no country in the world where person and property are held in better respect than in our own, but that there is perhaps also no country in the word where a more rigorous fight is put up against those who believe that they are free to let loose their lower instincts to the detriment of their fellow-beings.","Success is the sole earthly judge of right and wrong.","The future of a movement is conditioned by the fanaticism, yes, the intolerance, with which its adherents uphold it as the sole correct movement, and push it past other formations of a similar sort.","The greatness of every mighty organization embodying an idea in this world lies in the religious fanaticism and intolerance with which, fanatically convinced of its own right, it intolerantly imposes its will against all others.","We are a people of different faiths, but we are one. Which faith conquers the other is not the question; rather, the question is whether Christianity stands or falls.... We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity... in fact our movement is Christian. We are filled with a desire for Catholics and Protestants to discover one another in the deep distress of our own people.","The purpose of propaganda is not to provide interesting distraction for blas\xe9 young gentlemen, but to convince... the masses. But the masses are slow moving, and they always require a certain time before they are ready even to notice a thing, and only after the simplest ideas are repeated thousands of times will the masses finally remember them.","In political matters feeling often decides more correctly than reason.","It doesn\'t dawn on this depraved bourgeois world that this is positively a sin against all reason; that it is criminal lunacy to keep on drilling a born half-ape until people think they have made a lawyer out of him, while millions of members of the highest culture- race must remain in entirely unworthy positions; that it is a sin against the will of the Eternal Creator if His most gifted beings by the hundreds and hundreds of thousands are allowed to degenerate in the present proletarian morass, while Hottentots and Zulu Kaffirs are trained for intellectual professions.","Our national policies will not be revoked or modified, even for scientists. If the dismissal of Jewish scientists means the annihilation of contemporary German science, then we shall do without science for a few years.","Great liars are also great magicians.","One should guard against believing the great masses to be more stupid than they actually are.","The main plank in the National Socialist program is to abolish the liberalistic concept of the individual and the Marxist concept of humanity and to substitute for them the folk community, rooted in the soil and bound together by the bond of its common blood.","I began to study again, and now for the first time really achieved an understanding of the content of the Jew Karl Marx\'s life effort. Only now did his Capital become really intelligible to me, and also the struggle of the Social Democracy against the national economy, which aims only to prepare the ground for the domination of truly international finance and stock exchange capital.","The National Government will regard it as its first and foremost duty to revive in the nation the spirit of unity and cooperation. It will preserve and defend those basic principles on which our nation has been built. It regards Christianity as the foundation of our national morality, and the family as the basis of national life.","I looked at [Goering eating sausage] and I knew that what they say was true: that pigs eat the flesh of their own.","The parliamentary principle of decision by majorities only appears during quite short periods of history, and those are always periods of decadence in nations and States.","All those who are not racially pure are mere chaff.","The art of propaganda lies in understanding the emotional ideas of the great masses and finding, through a psychologically correct form, the way to the attention and thence to the heart of the broad masses.","Conscience is a Jewish invention.","[This is the] very first condition which has to be fulfilled in every kind of propaganda: a systematically one-sided attitude towards every problem that has to be dealt with.","Nothing falls into a man\'s lap from heaven.  It is from labour that life grows.","It seems to me that nothing would be more foolish than to re-establish the worship of Wotan. Our old mythology ceased to be viable when Christianity implanted itself. Nothing dies unless it is moribund.","The Whites have carried to these (colonial) people the worst that they could carry: the plagues of the world: materialism, fanaticism, alcoholism, and syphilis. Moreover, since what these people possessed on their own was superior to anything we could give them, they have remained themselves... The sole result of the activity of the colonizers is: they have everywhere aroused hatred.","The demand that defective people be prevented from propagating equally defective offspring is a demand of the clearest reason and if systematically executed represents the most humane act of mankind.","If, in the course of a thousand or two thousand years, science arrives at the necessity of renewing its points of view, that will not mean that science is a liar. Science cannot lie, for it\'s always striving, according to the momentary state of knowledge, to deduce what is true. When it makes a mistake, it does so in good faith. It\'s Christianity that\'s the liar. It\'s in perpetual conflict with itself.","The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to permit the conquered Eastern peoples to have arms. History teaches that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by doing so.","Today Christians... stand at the head of Germany... We want to fill our culture again with the Christian Spirit.","I am personally convinced of the great power and deep significance of Christianity, and I won\'t allow any other religion to be promoted.","Belief is harder to shake than knowledge.","The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity\'s illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew.","Nature knows no political boundaries. She puts living creatures on this globe and watches the free play of forces. She then confers the master\'s right on her favourite child, the strongest in courage and industry ... The stronger must dominate and not blend with the weaker, thus sacrificing his own greatness. Only the born weakling can view this as cruel.","To be a leader means to be able to move masses","He who would live must fight. He who doesn\'t wish to fight in this world, where permanent struggle is the law of life, has not the right to exist.","A stronger race will drive out the weaker ones, for the vital urge in its ultimate form will break down the absurd barriers of the so called humanity of individuals to make way for the humanity of nature which destroys the weak to give their place to the strong.","Neutrals and lukewarms do not make history.","There is only one right in the world and that right is one\'s own strength.","The stronger must dominate and not blend with the weaker, thus sacrificing his own greatness.","Parallel to the training of the body a struggle against the poisoning of the soul must begin. Our whole public life today is like a hothouse for sexual ideas and simulations. Just look at the bill of fare served up in our movies, vaudeville and theaters, and you will hardly be able to deny that this is not the right kind of food, particularly for the youth. Theater, art, literature, cinema, press, posters, and window displays must be cleansed of all manifestations of our rotting world and placed in the service of a moral, political and cultural idea.","It would be easier for the Devil to go to church and cross himself with holy water than for these people to comprehend the ideas which are accepted facts to us today.","The reason why the ancient world was so pure, light and serene was that it knew nothing of the two great scourges : the pox and Christianity.","Under the guidance of the Reich, Europe would speedily have become unified. Once the Jewish poison had been eradicated, unification would have been an easy matter. France and Italy, each defeated in turn at an interval of a few months by the two Germanic Powers, would have been well out of it. Both would have had to renounce their inappropriate aspirations to greatness. At the same time they would have had to renounce their pretensions in North Africa and the Near East; and that would have allowed Europe to pursue a bold policy of friendship towards Islam.","There is a road to freedom. Its milestones are obedience, endeavour, honesty, order, cleanliness, sobriety, truthfulness, sacrifice, and love of the fatherland.","The doom of a nation can be averted only by a storm of flowing passion, but only those who are passionate themselves can arouse passion in others.","The fox remains always a fox, the goose remains a goose, and the tiger will retain the character of a tiger.","Verily a man cannot serve two masters. And I consider the foundation or destruction of a religion far greater than the foundation or destruction of a state, let alone a party.","One People, one Reign, one Leader.","The primitive simplicity of their minds renders them a more easy prey to a big lie than a small one.","With satanic joy in his face, the black-haired Jewish youth lurks in wait for the unsuspecting girl whom he defiles with his blood, thus stealing her from her people.","Marching diverts man\'s thoughts. Marching kills thoughts. Marching makes an end of individuality. Marching is the indispensable magic stroke performed in order to accustom people to a mechanical, quasi-ritualistic activity until it becomes second nature.","Whatever goal, man has reached is due to his originality plus his brutality","The world will not help, the people must help themselves. Its own strength is the source of life. That strength the Almighty has given us to use; that in it and through it, we may wage the battle of our life The others in the past years have not had the blessing of the Almighty - of Him who in the last resort, whatever man may do, holds in His hands the final decision. Lord God, let us never hesitate or play the coward.","Himmler wants to send an expedition to Tibet to look for ancient manuscripts on the Aryans. The man is like a little schoolgirl. What culture is there in an old jug, I ask you?","The Aryan stands firm, one with God in his attitude to the world and its people.","I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so.","As in everything, nature is the best instructor.","How fortunate for governments that people do not think. There is no thinking except in giving and executing commands. If it were otherwise human society could not exist.","The women has her own battlefield with every child she brings into the world she fights a battle for the nation","Of course, the latter made no secret of his attitude toward the Jewish people, and when necessary he even took the whip to drive from the temple of the Lord this adversary of all humanity, who then as always saw in religion nothing but an instrument for his business existence. In return, Christ was nailed to the cross, while our present-day party Christians debase themselves to begging for Jewish votes at elections and later try to arrange political swindles with atheistic Jewish parties- and this against their own nation.","The universalists, the idealists, the Utopians all aim too high. They give promises of an unattainable paradise, and by doing so they deceive mankind. Whatever label they wear, whether they call themselves Christians, Communists, humanitarians, whether they are merely sincere but stupid or wire-pullers and cynics, they are all makers of slaves. I myself have always kept my eye fixed on a paradise which, in the nature of things, lies well within our reach. I mean an improvement in the lot of the German people. (21st February 1945)","When people attempt to rebel against the iron logic of Nature, they come into conflict with the very same principles to which they owe their existence as human beings. Their actions against Nature must lead to their own downfall.","Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord.","The earth continues to go round, whether it\'s the man who kills the tiger or the tiger who eats the man. The stronger asserts his will, it\'s the law of nature. The world doesn\'t change; its laws are eternal.","Kill, Destroy, Sack, Tell lie; how much you want after victory nobody asks why?","Man has become great through struggle","Today Christians ... stand at the head of [this country]... I pledge that I never will tie myself to parties who want to destroy Christianity .. We want to fill our culture again with the Christian spirit ... We want to burn out all the recent immoral developments in literature, in the theater, and in the press - in short, we want to burn out the poison of immorality which has entered into our whole life and culture as a result of liberal excess during the past ... (few) years.","I never lost my belief, in the midst of setbacks which were not spared me during my period of struggle. Providence has had the last word and brought me success.","No politician should ever let himself be photographed in a bathing suit.","State authority can never be an end in itself; for, if that were so, any kind of tyranny would be inviolable and sacred. If a government uses the instruments of power in its hands for the purpose of leading a people to ruin, then rebellion is not only the right but also the duty of every individual citizen.","The readiness to sacrifice one\'s personal work and, if necessary, even one\'s life for others shows its most highly developed form in the Aryan race. The greatness of the Aryan is not based on his intellectual powers; but rather on his willingness to devote all his faculties to the service of his community.","If I made peace with Russia today, I\'d only attack her again tomorrow. I just couldn\'t help myself.","[Propaganda] does not have multiple shadings; it has a positive and a negative; love or hate, right or wrong, truth or lie, never half this way and half that way.","There are certain truths which stand out so openly on the roadsides of life, as it were, that every passer-by may see them. Yet, because of their obviousness, the general run of people disregard such truths or at least they do not make them the object of any concious knowledge. People are so bliend to some of the simplest facts in everyday life that they are highly surprised when somebody calls attention to what everybody ought to know.","Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators.","The moment in Paris where I saluted Napoleon\'s tomb was one of the proudest of my life.","The union of theorizer, organizer, and leader in one man is the rarest phenomenon on earth; therein lies greatness.","Unscrupulous agitators have been at work spreading atrocity stories which can only be compared with those lies that were fabricated by the same instigators at the beginning of the Great War.","What luck for rulers that men do not think.","If positive Christianity means love of one\'s neighbour, i.e. the tending of the sick, the clothing of the poor, the feeding of the hungry, the giving of drink to those who are thirsty, then it is we who are the more positive Christians. For in these spheres the community of the people of National Socialist Germany has accomplished a prodigious work.","I am convinced that 1941 will be the crucial year of a great New Order in Europe. The world shall open up for everyone. Privileges for individuals, the tyranny of certain nations and their financial rulers shall fall. And last of all this year will help to provide the foundations of a real understanding among peoples, and with it the certainty of conciliation among nations. . . . Those nations who are still opposed to us will some day recognize the greater enemy within. Then they will join us in a combined front, a front against Jewish exploitation and racial degeneration.","A man does not die for something which he himself does not believe in.","Surrender is forbidden. Sixth Army will hold their positions to the last man and the last round and by their heroic endurance will make an unforgettable contribution toward the establishment of a defensive front and the salvation of the Western world.","I believe that those who knew me [in my youth] took me for an eccentric.","The purpose of social work should not be to distribute favours, but to restore rights.","The broad mass of a nation will more easily fall victim to a big lie than a small one. The greater the lie, the greater chance that it will be believed. All epoch-making events have been produced not by the written, but the spoken word.","The size of the lie is a definite factor in causing it to be believed.","...a man does not die for business, but for ideals.","Today I will once more be a prophet. If the international Jewish financiers, inside and outside Europe, succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevisation of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!","[The crowd] will finally succeed in remembering only the simplest concepts repeated a thousand times.","The sin against blood and race is the hereditary sin in this world and it brings disaster on every nation that commits it.","The right of personal freedom recedes before the duty to preserve the race.","Knowledge above the average can be crammed into the average man, but it remains dead, and in the last analysis sterile knowledge. The result is a man who may be a living dictionary but nevertheless falls down miserably in all special situations and decisive moments in life.","The spark of a genius exists in the brain of the truly creative man from the hour of his birth. True genius is always inborn and never cultivated, let alone learned.","The dogma of Christianity gets worn away before the advances of science. Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble.","As for the Jews, I am just carrying on with the same policy which the Catholic Church has adopted for fifteen hundred years, when it has regarded the Jews as dangerous and pushed them into ghettos etc., because it knew what the Jews were like.  I don\'t put race above religion, but I do see the danger in the representatives of this race for Church and State, and perhaps I am doing Christianity a great service.","The phrase, \'Emancipation of Women\' is only an invention of the Jewish intellect and its content is stamped with the same spirit. In the really good periods of German life the German woman never needed to emancipate herself.","Die breite Masse einesVolkes?einer gro\xdeen Lu\xab  ge leichter zum Opfer f a\xab llt als einer kleinen. The broad mass of a nation?will more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a small one.","What we have to fight for...is the freedom and independence of the fatherland, so that our people may be enabled to fulfill the mission assigned to it by the Creator.","The essential thing is the formation of the political will of the nation: that is the starting point for political action.","Words build bridges into unexplored regions.","Particularly the broad masses of the people can be moved only by the power of speech.","Faith is harder to shake than knowledge, love succumbs less to change than respect, hate is more enduring than aversion, and the impetus to the mightiest upheavals on this earth has at all times consisted less in a scientific knowledge dominating the masses than in a fanaticism which inspired them and sometimes in a hysteria which drove them forward.","The Western democracy of today is the forerunner of Marxism which without it would not be thinkable. It provides this world plague with the culture in which its germs can spread.","And I can fight only for something that I love, love only what I respect, and respect only what I at least know.","Perhaps we are only forerunners. Twenty or even a hundred years may pass before the National Socialist idea is victorious; those who believe in the ideal today may die: but what is a man in the development of a people, of mankind.","The art of reading and studying consists in remembering the essentials and forgetting what is not essential.","When there is change, it must not alter the content of what propaganda is driving at, but in the end must always say the same thing. For instance, a slogan must be presented from different angles, but the end of all remarks must always and immutably be the slogan itself. Only in this way can the propaganda have a unified and complete effect.","There arc no such things as desperate situations. Only desperate men.","Blood sin and desecration of the race are the original sin in this world and the end of a humanity which surrenders to it.","If Nature does not wish that weaker individuals should mate with the stronger, she wishes even less that a superior race should intermingle with an inferior one; because in such a case all her efforts, throughout hundreds of thousands of years, to establish an evolutionary higher stage of being, may thus be rendered futile.","Industry, technology, and commerce can thrive only as long as an idealistic national community offers the necessary preconditions. And these do not lie in material egoism, but in a spirit of sacrifice and joyful renunciation.","The goal of female education must invariably be the future mother.","I know it is unpopular. I know the timing is unpopular. I know the whole thing is unpopular. But I believe it is the right thing.","Help yourself, then God will also help you!","Struggle is the father of all things. It is not by the principles of humanity that man lives or is able to preserve himself above the animal world, but solely by means of the most brutal struggle.","The conviction of the justification of using even the most brutal weapons is always dependent on the presence of a fanatical belief in the necessity of the victory of a revolutionary new order on this globe.","y feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God\'s truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders.","For one cannot assume that God exists to help people who are too cowardly and too lazy to help themselves and think that God exists only to make up for the weakness of mankind. He does not exist for that purpose. He has always, at all times, blessed only those who were prepared to fight their own battles.","I say that they can be solved; there is no problem that cannot be, but faith is necessary. Think of the faith I had to have eighteen years ago, a single man on a lonely path. Yet I have come to leadership of the German people... Life is hard for many, but it is hardest if you are unhappy and have no faith. Have faith. Nothing can make me change my own belief.","There is nothing great in the world that does not owe its origin to the creative ability of an individual man.","The seed has been sown that will grow one day . . . to the glorious rebirth of the National Socialist movement of a truly united nation.","All epoch-making revolutionary events have been produced not by the written, but by the spoken word.","War is life  war is the origin of all things.","The personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil\\nassumes the living shape of the Jew.","I shall not rest until every German sees that it is a shameful thing to be a lawyer.","I follow my course with the precision and security of a sleepwalker.","The grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down.","I know the horrors of war: no gains can compensate for the losses it brings.","When a man is starving in the streets he is not thinking of bread and water, but of caviar and champagne!","A man who knows a thing, who is aware of a given danger, and sees the possibility of a remedy with his own eyes, has the duty and obligation, by God, not to work \'silently,\' but to stand up before the whole public against the evil and for its cure.","Gentlemen, you are about to witness the most famous victory in history.","The broad masses of a population are more amenable to the appeal of rhetoric than to any other force.","Everything on this earth can be made into something better. Every defeat may be made the foundation of a future victory. Every lost war may be the cause of a later resurgence. Every visitation of distress can give a new impetus to human energy. And out of every oppression those forces can develop which bring about a new rebirth.","If the question is still asked why National Socialism combats the Jewish element in Germany so fanatically, the answer can only be, because National Socialism wishes to establish a real community of the people.  Since we are National Socialists, we cannot permit an alien race to impose itself upon our working people as their leaders.","The German people have no idea of the extent to which they have to be gulled in order to be led.","For a people, as for an individual, it is tragic to have ambitions and to lack both the means essential to their fulfillment and any hope of acquiring those means.","I am insulted by the persistent asertion that I want war. Am I a fool? War! It would settle nothing.","Everything about the behaviour of American society reveals that it\'s half Judaized, and the other half negrified.","All great movements are popular movements. They are the volcanic eruptions of human passions and emotions, stirred into activity by the ruthless Goddess of Distress or by the torch of the spoken word cast into the midst of the people.","World history is made by minorities when this minority of number embodies the majority of will and determination.","The war against Russia will be such that it cannot be conducted in a knightly fashion. This struggle is one of ideologies and racial differences and will have to be conducted with unprecedented, unmerciful and unrelenting harshness.","In the course of history no people have ever been given freedom like a present, and if freedom did not cost anything than no people would ever keep it! Freedom has a high price, and men must ever struggle to preserve it.","I am convinced that I am acting as the agent of our Almighty Creator.  By fighting the Jews, I am doing the Lord\'s work.","Who says I am not under the special protection of God?","The young [Nazi] movement is in its nature and inner organization anti-parliamentarian; that is, it rejects... a principle of majority rule in which the leader is degraded to the level of mere executant of other people\'s wills and opinion.","A car for the people, an affordable Volkswagen, would bring great joy to the masses and the problems of building such a car must be faced with courage.","The world is not for cowardly peoples.","It is a mistake to make propaganda many-sided, like scientific instruction, for instance... As soon as you sacrifice this slogan and try to be many-sided, the effect will piddle away, for the crowd can neither digest nor retain the material offered.","The fight against Jewish world Bolshevization requires a clear attitude toward Soviet Russia. You cannot drive out the Devil with Beelzebub.","The task of propaganda lies not in a scientific training of the individual, but rather in directing the masses toward certain facts, events, necessities, etc., the purpose being to move their importance into the masses\' field of vision.","Secular schools can never be tolerated because such a school has no religious instruction and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith . . .\ufeff We need believing people.","With the defeat of the Reich and pending the emergence of the Asiatic, the African and, perhaps, the South American nationalisms, there will remain in the world only two Great Powers capable of confronting each other-the United States and Soviet Russia. The laws of both history and geography will compel these two Powers to a trial of strength, either military or in the fields of economics and ideology. (2nd April 1945)","When diplomacy ends, War begins.","The Church has realized that anything and everything can be built up on a document of that sort, no matter how contradictory or irreconcilable with it. The faithful will swallow it whole, so long as logical reasoning is never allowed to be brought to bear on it.","If freedom is short of weapons, we must compensate with willpower.","The state is a means to an end. Its end lies in the preservation and advancement of a community of physically and psychically homogenous creatures.","A meeting between two people who complete each other, who are made for each other, borders already, in my opinion, on a miracle.","Was there any form of filth or crime without at least one Jew involved in it? If you cut into such a sore, you find, like a maggot in a rotting body, often dazzled by the sudden light, a Jew.","Bolshevism turns flourishing countryside into sinister wastes of ruins; National Socialism transforms a Reich of destruction and misery into a healthy state with a flourishing economic life.","Never forget that the most sacred right on this earth is mans right to have the earth to till with his own hands, the most sacred sacrifice the blood that a man sheds for this earth.","Give me an athlete and I\'ll give you an army.","Even today I am not ashamed to say that, overpowered by stormy enthusiasm, I fell down on my knees and thanked Heaven from an overflowing heart for granting me the good fortune of being permitted to live at this time.","Only in the Roman Empire and in Spain under Arab domination has culture been a potent factor. Under the Arab, the standard attained was wholly admirable; to Spain flocked the greatest scientists, thinkers, astronomers, and mathematicians of the world, and side by side there flourished a spirit of sweet human tolerance and a sense of purist chivalry. Then with the advent of Christianity, came the barbarians.","This state of mind, which subordinates the interests of the ego to the conservation of the community, is really the first premise for every truly human culture... The basic attitude from which such activity arises, we call-to distinguish it from egoism and selfishness-idealism. By this we understand only the individual\'s capacity to make sacrifices for the community, for his fellow men.","I\'m sure that Nero didn\'t set fire to Rome. It was the Christian-Bolsheviks who did that, just as the Commune set fire to Paris in 1871 and the Communists set fire to the Reichstag in 1932.","We, as Aryans, can conceive of the state only as the living organism of a nationality which not only assures the preservation of its nationality, but by the development of its spiritual and ideal abilities leads it to the highest freedom.","Only the continuous and steady application of the methods for suppressing a doctrine, etc., makes it possible for a plan to succeed.","Be proud of your people when you don\'t have to be ashamed of any it\'s social class","We wish to fill our culture once more with the spirit of Christianity - but not only in theory.","We stand for the maintenance of private property... We shall protect free enterprise as the most expedient, or rather the sole possible economic order.","By educating the young generation along the right lines, the People\'s State will have to see to it that a generation of mankind is formed which will be adequate to this supreme combat that will decide the destinies of the world.","It is thus necessary that the individual should finally come to realize that his own ego is of no importance in comparison with the existence of the nation, that the position of the individual is conditioned solely by the interests of the nation as a whole.","Struggle is the father of all things, virtue lies in blood, leadership is primary and decisive","In relation to the political decontamination of our public life, the government will embark upon a systematic campaign to restore the nation\'s moral and material health. The whole educational system, theater, film, literature, the press and broadcasting - all these will be used as a means to this end.","In this hour I would ask of the Lord God only this: that, as in the past, so in the years to come He would give His blessing to our work and our action, to our judgement and our resolution, that He will safeguard us from all false pride and from all cowardly servility, that he may grant to us to find the straight path which His Providence has ordained for the German people, and that he may ever give us the courage to do the right, never to falter, never to yield before any violence, before any danger.","Churchill is the very type of a corrupt journalist. There is not a worse prostitute in politics. He himself has written that it\'sunimaginable what can be done in war with the help of lies. He\'s an utterly amoral repulsive creature. I\'m convinced that he has his place of refuge ready beyond the Atlantic. He obviously won\'t seek sanctuary in Canada. In Canada he\'d be beaten up. He\'ll go to his friends the Yankees. As soon as this damnable winter is over, we\'ll remedy all that.","I wish and will continue to wish, that the German people should learn that by reason of practical examples afforded by their ability and work, they are not a second-rate or inferior people in comparison with others.  On the contrary they are their equals according to all true standards of values and therefore entitled to equal rights in all respects.","The sacrifice of personal existence is necessary to secure the preservation of the species.","But Christianity is an invention of sick brains: one could imagine nothing more senseless, nor any more indecent way of turning the idea of the Godhead into a mockery.","The national government...will maintain and defend the foundations on which the power of our nation rests. It will offer strong protection to Christianity as the very basis of our collective morality.","For I must not measure the speech of a statesman to his people by the impression which it leaves in a university professor, but by the effect it exerts on the people. And this alone gives the standard for the speaker\'s genius.","Today in May 1938, the world around us suffers from the anxiety which the unemployment of millions brings with it.  In Germany we begin to be anxious because we have not enough workmen.","The Jew almost never marries a Christian woman; it is the Christian who marries a Jewess.","...the existence and increase of our race and nation, the sustenance of its children and the purity of its blood, the freedom and independence of the Fatherland, and the nation\'s ability to fulfill the mission appointed to it by the Creator of the universe.","Help thyself, then thou wilt also have the help of the Almighty.","Being daily better informed about their knowledge than my adversaries themselves, I argued till finally one day they applied the one means that wins the easiest victory over reason: terror and force.","For how shall we fill people with blind faith in the correctness of a doctrine, if we ourselves spread uncertainty and doubt by constant changes in its outward structure? ...Here, too, we can learn by the example of the Catholic Church. Though its doctrinal edifice, and in part quite superfluously, comes into collision with exact science and research, it is none the less unwilling to sacrifice so much as one little syllable of its dogmas... it is only such dogmas which lend to the whole body the character of a faith.","There is, then, no danger in the circumstances that anti-semitism will disappear, for it is the Jews themselves who add fuel to its flames and see that it is kept well stoked. Before the opposition to it can disappear, the malady itself must disappear. And from that point of view, you can rely on the Jews: as long as they survive, anti-semitism will never fade. (13th February 1945)","Nudity is undignified and an error of taste","I have been Europe\'s last hope. She proved incapable of refashioning herself by means of voluntary reform. She showed herself impervious to charm and persuasion. To take her I had to use violence. (26th February)","Only in the struggle between two philosophies can the weapon of brutal force, persistently and ruthlessly applied, lead to a decision for the side it supports.","This human world of ours would be inconceivable without the practical existence of a religious belief.","Heaven will smile on us again.","The parliamentary principle of vesting legislative power in the decision of the majority rejects the authority of the individual and puts a numerical quota of anonymous heads in its place. In doing so it contradicts the aristocratic principle, which is a fundamental law of nature.","We were not foolish enough to try to make a currency [backed by] gold of which we had none, but for every mark that was issued we required the equivalent of a mark\'s worth of work done or goods produced ... we laugh at the time our national financiers held the view that the value of a currency is regulated by the gold and securities lying in the vaults of a state bank.","Our ideology is intolerant...and peremptorily demands...the complete transformation of public life to its ideas.","Just as a man\'s denominational orientation is the result of upbringing, and only the religious need as such slumbers in his soul, the political opinion of the masses represents nothing but the final result of an incredibly tenacious and thorough manipulation of their mind and soul.","I had so often sung \'Deutschland u:ber Alles\' and shouted \'Heil\' at the top of my lungs, that it seemed to me almost a belated act of grace to be allowed to stand as a witness in the divine court of the eternal judge and proclaim the sincerity of this conviction.","I do not know what horrified me most [during the depression]: the economic misery of my companions [or] their moral and ethical coarseness.","Imagine me going around with a pot belly. It would mean political ruin.","While we destroyed the Centre Party, we have not only brought thousands of priests back into the Church, but to millions of respectable people we have restored their faith in their religion and in their priests. The union of the Evangelical Church in a single Church for the whole Reich, the Concordat with the Catholic Church, these are but milestones on the road which leads to the establishment of a useful relation and a useful co operation between the Reich and the two Confessions.","The beginning of every war is like opening the door into a dark room. One never knows what is hidden in the darkness.","I don\'t talk for the sake of talking. I do become intoxicated with sound. When I open my mouth, it\'s to say \\nsomething.","It matters not whether these weapons of ours are humane: if they gain us our freedom, they are justified before our conscience and before our God.","Nearly all Bolshevist agitators in Germany and elsewhere were Jews.","Only in the steady and constant application of force lies the very first prerequisite for success. This persistence, however, can always and only arise from a definite spiritual conviction. Any violence which does not spring from a firm, spiritual base, will be wavering and uncertain.","This arch-liar today shows that Britain never was in a position to wage war alone. This gabbler, this drunkard Churchill. And then his accomplice in the White House, this mad fool.","Social honour recognises no distinction between the employer and the unemployed.  All of them work for a common purpose and are entitled to equal honour and respect.","To them belong, not only the truly great statesmen, but all other great reformers as well. Beside Frederick the Great stands Martin Luther as well as Richard Wagner.","National Socialist Germany wishes for peace because it recognises the simple fact that no war would be likely to substantially to ameliorate the state of distress in Europe.  The distress would probably be made the greater thereby. If only the leaders and rulers had wanted peace, the people would never have wished for war.","The majority can never replace the man","The unity of a nation\'s spirit and will are worth far more than the freedom of the spirit and will of an individual; and that the higher  interests involved in the life of the whole must here set the limits and lay down the duties of the interests of the individual.","The world has no reason for fighting in our defense, and as a matter of principle God does not make cowardly nations free.","I have given orders to my Death units to exterminate without mercy or pity men, women and children belonging to the Polish speaking race... After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Armenians?","If only one country, for whatever reason, tolerates a Jewish family in it, that family will become the germ center for fresh sedition. If one little Jewish boy survives without any Jewish education, with no synagogue and no Hebrew school, it [Judaism] is in his soul. Even if there had never been a synagogue or a Jewish school or an Old Testament, the Jewish spirit would still exist and exert its influence. It has been there from the beginning and there is no Jew, not a single one, who does not personify it.","Mankind has grown strong in eternal struggles and it will only perish through eternal peace.","The application of force alone, without support based on a spiritual concept, can never bring about the destruction of an idea or arrest the propagation of it, unless one is ready and able to ruthlessly to exterminate the last upholders of that idea even to a man, and also wipe out any tradition which it may tend to leave behind.","If I can send the flower of the German nation into the hell of war without the smallest pity for the shedding of precious German blood, then surely I have the right to remove millions of an inferior race that breeds like vermin.","Gold is not necessary. I have no interest in gold. We\'ll build a solid state, without an ounce of gold behind it. Anyone who sells above the set prices, let him be marched off to a concentration. That\'s the bastion of money.","Remain strong in your faith, as you were in former years. In this faith, in its close-knit unity our people to-day goes straight forward on its way and no power on earth will avail to stop it.","I believe that this was God\'s Will - to send a boy into the Reich, to let him become its Leader, in order to bring his home country into the Reich. Otherwise one must doubt Providence.","Blood mixture and the result drop in the racial level is the sole cause of the dying out of old cultures; for men do not perish as a result of lost wars, but by the loss of that force of resistance which is continued only in pure blood. All who are not of good race in this world are chaff.","Let us never forget the duty, which we have taken upon us","The internal and international criminal gang will either be forced to work or simply exterminated.","In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and of adders.","I am asking of no man more than I myself was ready throughout four years to do","Every new invention has been a protest of genius against the masses.","As soon as by one\'s own propaganda even a glimpse of right on the other side is admitted, the cause for doubting one\'s own right is laid.","Anyone who sees and paints a sky green and fields blue ought to be sterilized.","For the sake of historical truth I must verify that only the Greeks, of all the adversaries who confronted us, fought with bold courage and highest disregard of death.","I die with a joyful heart in the knowledge of our infinite achievements and of a contribution unique in the history that bears my name.","Thus my faith grew that my beautiful dream for the future would become reality after all, even though this might require long years.","The struggle for world domination is between me and the Jews. All else is meaningless. The Jews have inflicted two wounds on the world: Circumcision for the body and conscience for the soul. I come to free mankind from their shackles.","Germany has concluded a Non-Aggression Pact with Poland. We shall adhere to it unconditionally. We recognize Poland as the home of a great and nationally conscious people.","We need not fear the judgement of history. Who, after all, speaks today of the extermination of the Armenians?","When our party had only seven men, it already had two principles. First, it wanted to be a party with a true ideology. And second, it wanted to be the one and only power in Germany.","In the ranks of the movement [National Socialist movement], the most devout Protestant could sit beside the most devout Catholic, without coming into the slightest conflict with his religious convictions. The mighty common struggle which both carried on against the destroyer of Aryan humanity had, on the contrary, taught them mutually to respect and esteem one another.","Anyone who dares to lay hands on the highest image of the Lord commits sacrilege against the benevolent creator of this miracle and contributes to the expulsion from paradise.","Politics is history in the making.","Thus inwardly armed with confidence in God and the unshakable stupidity of the voting citizenry, the politicians can begin the fight for the \'remaking\' of the Reich as they call it.","I am convinced that nothing will happen to me, for I know the greatness of the task for which Providence has chosen me.","People are more likely to believe a big lie than a small one.","Also noteworthy is the increasingly violent struggle against the dogmatic foundations of the various churches without which in this human world the practical existence of a religious faith is not conceivable.","If we pursue this way, if we are decent, industrious, and honest, if we so loyally and truly fulfill our duty, then it is my conviction that in the future as in the past the Lord God will always help us. In the long run He never leaves decent folk in the lurch. Often He may test them, He may send trials upon them, but in the long run He always lets His sun shine upon them once more and at the end He gives them His blessing.","A single blow must destroy the enemy... without regard of losses... a gigantic all-destroying blow.","If the German nation wants to end a state of affairs that threatens its extermination in Europe, it must not fall into the error of the pre-War period and make enemies of God and the world; it must recognize the most dangerous enemy and strike at him with all its concentrated power. And if this victory is obtained through sacrifices elsewhere, the coming generations of our people will not condemn us.","I will reflect a thousand times over before I allow the German Volk to become entangled in agreements whose consequences are not readily evident.","We need free men who feel and know that God is in themselves","The anti-Semitism of the new movement was based on religious ideas instead of racial knowledge.","The President of the United States has a much wider power than the German Kaiser had, for he depended on parliament.","I know that one is able to win people far more by the spoken that by the written word, and that every great movement on this globe owes its rise to the great speakers and not to the great writers.","From millions of men . . . one man must step forward who with apodictic force will form granite principles from the wavering idea-world of the broad masses and take up the struggle for their sole correctness, until from the shifting waves of a fre thought-world there will arise a brazen cliff of solid unity in faith and will.","It is not the neutrals or the lukewarm who make history.","A folkish state must therefore begin by raising marriage from the level of a continuous defilement of the race, and give it the consecration of an institution which is called upon to produce images of the Lord and not monstrosities halfway between man and ape.","Providence has ordained that I should be the greatest liberator of humanity. I am freeing man from the restraints of an intelligence that has taken charge, from the dirty and degrading self-mortification of a false vision called conscience and morality, and from the demands of a freedom and independence which only a very few can bear.","Besides that, I believe one thing: there is a Lord God! And this Lord God creates the peoples.","First, therefore, [the Jew] goes about making up to the people for his previous sins against them. He begins his career as the \'benefactor\' of mankind. Since his new benevolence has a practical foundation, he cannot very well adhere to the old Biblical recommendation, that the left hand should not know what the right hand giveth.","It may be that today gold has become the exclusive ruler of life, but the time will come when man will again bow down before a higher god.","The fact that the Catholic Church has come to an agreement with Fascist Italy ... proves beyond doubt that the Fascist world of ideas is closer to Christianity than those of Jewish liberalism or even atheistic Marxism.","The man who contemplates the universe with his eyes wide open is the man with the greatest amount of natural piety; not in the religious sense, but in the sense of an intimate harmony with things.","I saw my enemies in Munich, and they are worms.","In a war the last thing the English know is how to practice fair play.","Defend Paris to the last, destroy all bridges over the Seine and devastate the city.","The only preventative measure one can take is to live irregularly.","The State dominates the Nation because it alone represents it.","I shall never come personally to terms with the Christian lie.","Either one is factually equal, and consequently morally equal as well; on the other hand, if one is morally equal, there is no reason why one should contest factual equality of rights or simply refuse to grant them.","Germany must either be a world power or there will be no Germany","The German has not the slightest notion how a people must be misled if the adherence of the masses is sought.","If we consider how greatly he has sinned against the masses in the course of the centuries, how he has squeezed and sucked the blood again and again; if furthermore, we consider how the people gradually learned to hate him for this, and ended up by regarding his existence as nothing but punishment of Heaven for the other peoples, we can understand how hard this shift must be for the Jew.","For as soon as the procreative faculty is thwarted and the number of births diminished, the natural struggle for existence which allows only healthy and strong individuals to survive is replaced by a sheer craze to \'save\' feeble and even diseased creatures at any cost. And thus the seeds are sown for a human progeny which will become more and more miserable from one generation to another, as long as Nature\'s will is scorned.","Generals think war should be waged like the tourneys of the Middle Ages. I have no use for knights; I need revolutionaries.","When I was a worker I busied myself with socialist or, if you like, marxist  literature.","Night gangsters! For this crime I will exact a thousand fold revenge!","Difference which exists between the lowest, so-called men, and the other higher races is greater than between the lowest men and the highest apes.","The holocaust is the solution to the Jews final question","The black-haired Jewish youth lies in wait for hours on end, satanically glaring at and spying on the unsuspicious girl whom he plans to seduce, adulterating her blood and removing her from the bosom of her own people. The Jew uses every possible means to undermine the racial foundations of a subjugated people.","One of our most important tasks will be to save future generations from a similar political fate and to maintain for ever watchful in them a knowledge of the menace of Jewry. For this reason alone it is vital that the Passion play be continued at Oberammergau; for never has the menace of Jewry been so convincingly portrayed as in this presentation of what happened in the times of the Romans. There one sees in Pontius Pilate a Roman racially and intellectually so superior, that he stands like a firm, clean rock in the middle of the whole muck and mire of Jewry.","[W]e will do what we like with the bourgeoisie. ... We give the orders; they do what they are told. Any resistance will be broken ruthlessly.","The national State divides its inhabitants into three classes: State citizens, State subjects, and foreigners.  It must be held in greater honour to be a citizen of this Reich even if only a crossing-sweeper, than to be a king in a foreign State.","For the folk-community does not exist on the fictitious value of money but on the results of productive labour, which is what gives money its value.","But if out of smugness, or even cowardice, this battle is not fought to its end, then take a look at the peoples five hundred years from now. I think you will find but few images of God, unless you want to profane the Almighty.","The German people are not a warlike nation. It is a soldierly one, which means it does not want a war, but does not fear it. It loves peace but also loves its honor and freedom","Everlasting peace will come to the world when the last man has slain the last but one.","Any alliance whose purpose is not the intention to wage war is senseless and useless.","The only people I have been able to use are those who fought","In the course of carrying through our program for which we have calculated four years, two and one-quarter million out of six million unemployed have already received employment again within a period of eight short months.","The more modest its intellectual ballast, the more exclusively it takes into consideration the emotions of the masses, the more effective [propaganda] will be.","For God\'s will gave men their form, their essence and their abilities. Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord\'s creation, the divine will.","History is as Old as My Grandfather","Differentiation of treatment is not motivated by the difference of value of the two races, but of the fundamental difference of their respective natures.","I myself and my wife - in order to escape the disgrace of deposition or capitulation - choose death. It is our wish to be burnt immediately on the spot where I have carried out the greatest part of my daily work in the course of a twelve years\' service to my people.","The sportive, knightly battle awakens the best human characteristics. It doesn\'t separate, but unites the combatants in understanding and respect. He also helps to connect the countries in the spirit of peace. That\'s why the Olympic Flame should never die.","It must be thoroughly understood that the lost land will never be won back by solemn appeals to the God, nor by hopes in any League of Nations, but only by the force of arms.","For the greatest revolutionary changes on this earth would not have been thinkable if their motive force, instead of fanatical, yes, hysterical passion, had been merely the bourgeois virtues of law and order.","Something therefore always remains and sticks from the most imprudent of lies, a fact which all bodies and individuals concerned in the art of lying in this world know only too well, and therefore they stop at nothing to achieve this end.","By rejecting the authority of the individual and replacing it by the numbers of some momentary mob, the parliamentary principle of majority rule sins against the basic aristocratic principle of Nature.","For there is one thing we must never forget... the majority can never replace the man. And no more than a hundred empty heads make one wise man will an heroic decision arise from a hundred cowards.","I intend to set up a thousand-year Reich and anyone who supports me in this battle is a fellow-fighter for a unique spiritual-I would say divine-creation... Rudolf Hess, my assistant of many years standing, would tell you: If we have such a leader, God is with us.","For when a people is not willing or able to fight for its existence- Providence in its eternal justice has decreed that people\'s end.","I shall give a propagandist reason for starting the war, no matter whether it is plausible or not. The victor will not be asked afterwards whether he told the truth or not. When starting and waging war it is not right that matters, but victory.","In Freethinkers Hall, which before the Nazi resurgence was the national headquarters of the German Freethinkers League, the Berlin Protestant church authorities have opened a bureau for advice to the public in church matters. Its chief object is to win back former churchgoers and assist those who have not previously belonged to any religious congregation in obtaining church membership. The German Freethinkers League, which was swept away by the national revolution, was the largest of such organizations in Germany. It had about 500,000 members.","We National Socialists must hold unflinchingly to our aim in foreign policy, namely to secure for the German people the land and soil to which they are entitles on this earth. And this action is the only one which, before God and or German posterity, would make any sacrifice of blood seem justified: before God, since we have been put on this earth with the mission of eternal struggle for our daily bread.","Idealism does not represent a superfluous expression of emotion, but in truth it has been, is, and will be, the premise for what we designate as human culture...Without his idealistic attitude all, even the most dazzling faculties of the intellect, would remain mere intellect just like outward appearance without inner value, and never creative force....The purest idealism is unconsciously equivalent to the deepest knowledge.","Lord God, let us never hesitate or play the coward, let us never forget the duty which we have taken upon us.... We are all proud that through God\'s powerful aid we have become once more true Germans.","Our strength lies in our intensive attacks and our barbarity...After all, who today remembers the genocide of the Armenians?","You only have to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.","The State must act as the guardian of a millennial future in the face of which the wishes and the selfishness of the individual must appear as nothing and submit.","In this world him who does not abandon himself the Almighty will not desert. Him who helps himself will the Almighty always also help; He will show him the way by which he can gain his rights, his freedom, and therefore his future.","Our German language has a word which in a magnificent way denotes conduct based on this spirit: doing one\'s duty [Pflichterf\xfcllung]-which means serving the community instead of contenting oneself. We have a word for the basic disposition which underlies conduct of this kind in contrast to egoism and selfishness-idealism. By \'idealism\' we mean only the ability of the individual to sacrifice himself for the whole, for his fellow men.","Christianity [is] a rebellion against natural law, a protest against nature.","...absolute intolerance also provides long growth.","The Jew has always been a people with definite racial characteristics and never a religion.","I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator.","German economic salvation has been brought about solely through the efforts of the German people and the experience they have gained.  Countries abroad have contributed nothing to this.","Of course, even the general designation \'religious\' includes various basic ideas or convictions, for example, the indestructibility of the soul, the eternity of its existence, the existence of a higher being, etc. But all these ideas, regardless of how convincing they may be for the individual, are submitted to the critical examination of this individual and hence to a fluctuating affirmation or negation until emotional divination or knowledge assumes the binding force of apodictic faith.","Our thoughts and actions must in no way be determined by the approval or disapproval of our time, but by the binding obligation to a truth which we have recognized.","After the USA, Germany today is once more the leading steel producing country in the world.","I begin with the young. We older ones are used up but my magnificent youngsters! Are there finer ones anywhere in the world? Look at all these men and boys! What material! With you and I, we can make a new world.","But in the great hour Heaven sent the German people a great man, Herr von Cuno.","We have now armed to such an extent as the world has never before seen.","All upright Germans will be National Socialists, but only the best National Socialists will be party members!","When human hearts break and human hearts despair, then from the twilight of the past the great conquerors of distress and care, of disgrace and misery, of spiritual slavery and physical compulsion, look down on them and hold out their eternal hands to the despairing mortals.","The scream of the twelve-inch shrapnel is more penetrating than the hiss from a thousand Jewish newspaper vipers. Therefore let them go on with their hissing.","Imbued with the desire to secure for the German people the great religious, moral, and cultural values rooted in the two Christian Confessions, we have abolished the political organizations but strengthened the religious institutions.","The result of the revolution in Germany has been to establish a democracy in the best sense of the word.  We are steering towards an order of things guaranteeing a process of a natural and reasonable selection in the domain of political leadership, thanks to which that leadership will be entrusted to the most competent, irrespective of their descent, name or fortune.  The memorable words of the great Corsican that every soldier carries a Field Marshal\'s baton in his knapsack, will find its political complement in Germany.","As long as leadership from above was not lacking, the people fulfilled their duty and obligation overwhelmingly. Whether Protestant pastor or Catholic priest, both together and particularly at the first flare, there really existed in both camps but a single holy German Reich, for whose existence and future each man turned to his own heaven.","But even more: all at once the Jew also becomes liberal and begins to rave about the necessary progress of mankind.","Whoever wants to understand National Socialist Germany must know Wagner.","How many of my basic principles were upset by this change in my attitude toward the Christian Social movement! My views with regard to anti-Semitism thus succumbed to the passage of time, and this was my greatest transformation of all.","Dunkirk has fallen... with it has ended the greatest battle of world history. Soldiers! My confidence in you knew no bounds. You have not disappointed me.","Due to his own original special nature, the Jew cannot possess a religious institution, if for no other reason because he lacks idealism in any form, and hence belief in a hereafter is absolutely foreign to him. And a religion in the Aryan sense cannot be imagined which lacks the conviction of survival after death in some form. Indeed, the Talmud is not a book to prepare a man for the hereafter, but only for a practical and profitable life in this world.","Since I have fought against these Jewish-Soviet ideas in Germany, since I have conquered and stamped out this peril, I fancy that I possess a better comprehension of its character than do these men who have only to deal with it in the field of literature.","There is something very unhealthy about Christianity.","Our task is to harness the God-given energy of this German nation to stand firm for the Truth.","To fight, we must have oil for our machine.","It is a tragedy of the Germanic world that Jesus was Judaised, distorted, falsified; and an alien Asiatic spirit was forced upon us. That is a crime we must repair.","The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in his own denomination, of making people stop just talking superficially of God\'s will, and actually fulfill God\'s will, and not let God\'s word be desecrated. For God\'s will gave men their form, their essence and their abilities. Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord\'s creation, the divine will.","Even a superficial glance is sufficient to show that all the innumerable forms in which the life-urge of Nature manifests itself are subject to a fundamental law - one may call it an iron law of Nature - which compels the various species to keep within the definite limits of their own life-forms when propagating and multiplying their kind.","Reading is not an end to itself, but a means to an end.","The great masses of people do not consist of philosophers; precisely for the masses, faith is often the sole foundation of a moral attitude. The various substitutes have not proved so successful from the standpoint of results that they could be regarded as a useful replacement for previous religious creeds. But if religious doctrine and faith are really to embrace the broad masses, the unconditional authority of the content of this faith is the foundation of all efficacy.","The National Socialist Movement, which aims at establishing the National Socialist People\'s State, must always bear steadfastly in mind the principle that every future institution under that State must be rooted in the movement itself.","I can not be mistaken - what I say and do is historical.I follow my life with the precision and security of a sleep walker","Catholics and Protestants are fighting with one another... while the enemy of Aryan humanity and all Christendom is laughing up his sleeve.","And the founder of Christianity made no secret indeed of his estimation of the Jewish people. When He found it necessary, He drove those enemies of the human race out of the Temple of God.","The whole of education should be designed so as to occupy a boy\'s free time in cultivation of his body.  He has no right to loaf about idly; but after his day\'s work is done, he ought to harden his young body, so that life may not find him soft when he enters it.  No one should be allowed to sin at the expense of posterity, that is, of the race.","The wage of a people has meaning only when it arises from production.  Every increase in production should benefit the whole people and raise the people\'s standards of living.","The world is undoubtedly going through great changes.  The only question is whether the outcome will be the good of Aryan humanity or profits for the Jew.  The task of the national state will, therefore, be to preserve the race and fit it to meet the final and great decisions on this globe by suitable education of its youth.","I had excellent opportunity to intoxicate myself with the solemn splendor of the brilliant church festivals. As was only natural, the abbot seemed to me, as the village priest had once seemed to my father, the highest and most desirable ideal.","All advertising, whether it lies in the field of business or of politics, will carry success by continuity and regular uniformity of application.","Where Napoleon failed, I shall succeed, I shall land on the shores of Britain.","In actual fact the pacifistic-humane idea is perfectly all right perhaps when the highest type of man has previously conquered and subjected the world to an extent that makes him the sole ruler of this earth\u2026 Therefore, first struggle and then perhaps pacifism.","I will never allow anyone to divide this people once more into religious camps, each fighting the other","While both denominations maintain missions in Asia and Africa in order to win new followers for their doctrine- an activity which can boast but very modest success compared to the advance of the Mohammedan faith in particular- right here in Europe they lose millions and millions of inward adherents who either are alien to all religious life or simply go their own ways. The consequences, particularly from a moral point of view, are not favorable.","Genius is a will-o\'-the-wisp if it lacks a solid foundation of perseverence and fanatical tenacity. This is the most important thing in all of human life.","Historically speaking, the Christian religion is nothing but a Jewish sect... After the destruction of Judaism, the extinction of Christian slave morals must follow logically... Ah, the God of the deserts, that crazed, stupid, vengeful Asiatic despot with his power to make laws!","It would have been more to the point, more honest and more Christian, in past decades not to support those who intentionally destroyed healthy life than to rebel against those who have no other wish than to avoid disease. Moreover, a policy of laissez faire in this sphere is not only cruelty to the individual guiltless victims but also to the nation as a whole... If the Churches were to declare themselves ready to take over the treatment and care of those suffering from hereditary diseases, we should be quite ready to refrain from sterilizing them.","The attack against dogmas as such, therefore, strongly resembles the struggle against the general legal foundations of a state, and , as the latter would end in a total anarchy of the state, the former would end in a worthless religious nihilism.","Then we\'ll work a hundred years without physics and chemistry.","Just as the world cannot live on wars, so people cannot on revolutions","The National Socialist Movement has wrought this miracle. If Almighty God granted success to this work, then the Party was His instrument.","In vowing ourselves to one another, we are entitled to stand before the Almighty and ask Him for His grace and His blessing.","How fortunate for leaders that men do not think (also, What luck for rulers that men do not think).","And so he [the Jew] advances on his fatal road until another force comes forth to oppose him, and in a mighty struggle hurls the heaven-stormer back to Lucifer. Germany is today the next great war aim of Bolshevism. It requires all the force of a young missionary idea to raise our people up again, to free them from the snares of this international serpent.","The more abstractly correct and hence powerful this idea will be, the more impossible remains its complete fulfillment as long as it continues to depend on human beings... If this were not so, the founders of religion could not be counted among the greatest men of this earth... In its workings, even the religion of love is only the weak reflection of the will of its exalted founder; its significance, however, lies in the direction which it attempted to give to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality.","The German countryside must be preserved under all circumstances, for it is and has forever been the source of strength and greatness of our people.","People have killed only when they could not achieve their aim in other ways there is a broadened strategy, with intellectual weapons why should I demoralize the enemy by military means if I can do so better and more cheaply in other ways?","Only so you can appeal to your God and pray Him to support and bless your courage, your work, your perseverance, your strength, your resolution, and with all these your claim on life.","Our enemies must not deceive themselves-in the 2,000 years of German history known to us, our people have never been more united than today. The Lord of the Universe has treated us so well in the past years that we bow in gratitude to a providence which has allowed us to be members of such a great nation. We thank Him that we also can be entered with honor into the ever-lasting book of German history!","The fantastic political and economic burdens imposed by that treaty have entirely disillusioned the German people and annihilated its belief in justice.","May therefore God give us the strength to continue to do our duty and with this prayer we bow in homage before our dead heroes, before those whom they have left behind in bereavement, and before all the other victims of this war.","Whoever lights the torch of war in Europe can wish for nothing but chaos.","Worst of all, however, is the devastation wrought by the misuse of religious conviction for political ends. In truth, we cannot sharply enough attack those wretched crooks who would like to make religion an implement to perform political or rather business services for them.","The best characterization is provided by the product of this religious education, the Jew himself. His life is only of this world, and his spirit is inwardly as alien to true Christianity as his nature two thousand years previous was to the great founder of the new doctrine.","For over five years this man [Winston Churchill] has been chasing around Europe like a madman in search of something he could set on fire. Unfortunately he again and again finds hirelings who open the gates of their country to this international incendiary.","I wouldn\'t watch football if it wasn\'t for Lord Bendtner","This game is repeated again and again, and in it the role of the so-called \'German princes\' is just as miserable as that of the Jews themselves. These lords were really God\'s punishment for their beloved peoples and find their parallels only in the various ministers of the present time.","If today I stand here as a revolutionary, it is as a revolutionary against the Revolution.","The purest idealism is unconsciously equivalent to the deepest knowledge.","I speak in the name of the entire German people when I assure the world that we all share the honest wish to eliminate the enmity that brings far more costs than any possible benefits. It would be a wonderful thing for all of humanity if both peoples would renounce force against each other forever. The German people are ready to make such a pledge.","The efficiency of a truly national leader consists primarily in preventing the division of the attention of a people, and always in concentrating it on a single enemy.","Believe me, National Socialism would not be worth anything if it were to be confined to Germany and did not secure the rule of the superior race over the whole world for at least one or two thousand years.","Armies for the preservation of peace do not exist; they exist only for the triumphant exertion of war.","For there is hardly a state or nation in existence which has not once had the misfortune, even if it was in the right a thousand times over, to be defeated by a stronger opponent or a stronger coalition.","The greatness of Christianity did not lie in attempted negotiations for compromise with any similar philosophical opinions in the ancient world, but in its inexorable fanaticism in preaching and fighting for its own doctrine.","I will not wage war against women and children! I have instructed my air force to limit their attacks to military objectives. However, if the enemy should conclude from this that he might get away with waging war in a different manner he will receive an answer that he\'ll be knocked out of his wits!","We were convinced that the people need and require this faith.  We have therefore undertaken the fight against the atheistic movement, and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations; we have stamped it out.","After 15 years of work I have achieved, as a common German soldier and merely with my fanatical willpower, the unity of the German nation, and have freed it from the death sentence of Versailles.","Propaganda tries to force a doctrine on the whole people; the [party] organization embraces within its scope only those who do not threaten on psychological grounds to become a brake on the further dissemination of ideas.","Germany suffered most as a consequence of this Peace Treaty and the general insecurity which was bound to arise from it.  The unemployment figure rose to a third of the number usually employed in the nation, which means, however, that by counting the families of the unemployed as well there were 26 million people in Germany out of a population of 65 millions faced by an absolutely hopeless future.","No more than a famous master can be replaced and another take over the completion of the half-finished painting he has left behind can the great poet and thinker, the great statesman and the great soldier, be replaced. For their activity lies always in the province of art. It is not mechanically trained but inborn by God\'s grace.","There must be no majority decisions, but only responsible persons, and the word \'council\' must be restored to its original meaning. Surely every man will have advisers by his side, but the decision will be made by one man.","More people died as a result of the tiny abortive Easter Uprising against British rule in Ireland (1916) than died as a result of political violence in Germany during the entire National Socialist revolution.","Germany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the internal affair of Austria, to annex Austria, or to conclude an Anschluss","For this, to be sure, from the child\'s primer down to the last newspaper, every theater and every movie house, every advertising pillar and every billboard, must be pressed into the service of this one great mission, until the timorous prayer of our present parlor patriots: \'Lord, make us free!\' is transformed in the brain of the smallest boy into the burning plea: \'Almighty God, bless our arms when the time comes; be just as thou hast always been; judge now whether we be deserving of freedom; Lord, bless our battle!\\"","If the war is lost, the nation will also perish. This fate is inevitable. There is no necessity to take into consideration the basis which the people will need to continue a most primitive existence. On the contrary, it will be better to destroy things ourselves because this nation will have proved to be the weaker one and the future will belong solely to the stronger eastern nation [Russia]. Besides, those who remain after the battle are only the inferior ones, for the good ones have been killed.","We can safely make one prophecy: whatever the outcome of this war, the British Empire is at an end. It has been mortally wounded. The future of the British people is to die of hunger and tuberculosis in their cursed island.","Christianity is the worst of the regressions that mankind can ever have undergone, and it\'s the Jew who, thanks to this diabolic invention, has thrown him back fifteen centuries. The only thing that would be still worse would be victory for the Jew through Bolshevism. If Bolshevism triumphed, mankind would lose the gift of laughter and joy. It would become merely a shapeless mass, doomed to grayness and despair.","In nearly all the matters in which the Pan-German movement was wanting, the attitude of the Christian Social Party was correct and well-planned.","Any violence which does not spring from a spiritual base, will be wavering and uncertain. It lacks the stability which can only rest in a fanatical outlook.","When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very devil, if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom today this poor people are plundered and exposed.","The folkish philosophy of life must succeed in bringing about that nobler age in which men no longer are concerned with breeding dogs, horses, and cats, but in elevating man himself.","Paris must either not fall into the hands of the enemy or the enemy must find it only a wasteland.","If we had these rockets in 1939, we should never have had this war.","The National Socialist state refuses to admit female labour in factories merely because such labour is cheap. There is, of course, a certain amount of industrial work which can only be performed by women, but an essential condition is that this sort of work should not be injurious to health.","If artists do see fields blue they are deranged, and should go to an asylum. If they only pretend to see them blue, they are criminals and should go to prison.","England, unlike in 1914, will not allow herself to blunder into a war lasting for years.... Such is the fate of rich countries.. .Not even England has the money nowadays to fight a world war. What should England fight for? You don\'t get yourself killed over an ally.","Sporting chivalrous contest helps knit the bonds of peace between nations. Therefore may the Olympic flame never expire.","Sparta must be regarded as the first v\xf6lkisch state. The exposure of the sick, weak, deformed children, in short, their destruction, was more decent and in truth a thousand times more human than the wretched insanity of our day which preserves the most pathological subject.","The root of the whole evil lay, particularly in Schonerer\'s opinion, in the fact that the directing body of the Catholic Church was not in Germany, and that for this very reason alone it was hostile to the interests of our nationality.","The [National Socialist] Party...is convinced that our nation can achieve permanent health only from within on the basis of the principle: The common interest before self-interest.","The youthful brain should in general not be burdened with things ninety-five percent of which it cannot use and hence forgets again... In many cases, the material to be learned in the various subjects is so swollen that only a fraction of it remains in the head of the individual pupil, and only a fraction of this abundance can find application, while on the other hand it is not adequate for the man working and earning his living in a definite field.","I, for my part, acknowledge another precept which says that man must deal the final blow to those whose downfall is destined by God.","For the greater a man\'s works for the future, the less the present can comprehend them; the harder his fight, and the rarer success. If, however, once in centuries success does come to a man, perhaps in his latter days a faint beam of his coming glory may shine upon him. To be sure, these great men are only the Marathon runners of history; the laurel wreath of the present touches only the brow of the dying hero.","It [the Sudetenland] is the last territorial claim that I have to make in Europe.","Today I must humbly thank Providence, whose grace has enabled me, who was once an unknown soldier in the War, to bring to a successful issue the struggle for the restoration of our honor and rights as a nation.","How to achieve the moral breakdown of the enemy before the war has started - that is the problem that interests me. Whoever has experienced war at the front will want to refrain from all avoidable bloodshed.","Whoever lights the torch of war in Europe can wish for nothing but chaos. We, however, live in the firm conviction our times will see not the decline but the renaissance of the West. It is our proud hope and our unshakable belief Germany can make an imperishable contribution to this great work.","I go the way that Providence dictates with the assurance of a sleepwalker.","Neither I nor anyone else in Germany would even consider placing any \\"conditions\\" on our possible return to the League of Nations. Whether or not we return to this body depends exclusively upon whether we can belong to it as a completely equal nation. This is not a \\"condition,\\" but a matter of course.","Today our achievements are so vast that the whole world has become interested in them.","In the Spanish people there is a mixture of Gothic, Frankish and Moorish blood. One can speak of the Spaniard as one would speak of a brave anarchist. The Arabian epoch-the Arabs look down on the Turks as they do on dogs-was the most cultured, the most intellectual and in every way best and happiest epoch in Spanish history. It was followed by the period of the persecutions with its unceasing atrocities.","I myself was and still am a child of the people.  It was not for the capitalists that I undertook this struggle; it was for the German working man that I took my stand.","The fact that the Vatican is concluding a treaty with the new Germany means the acknowledgement of the National Socialist state by the Catholic Church. This treaty shows the whole world clearly and unequivocally that the assertion that National Socialism is hostile to religion is a lie.","The National Socialist Party will prevent in the future, by force if necessary, all meetings and lectures which are likely to exercise a depressing influence on the German state.","As long as the League of Nations constitutes only a treaty of guarantee for the victorious nations, it is by no means worthy of its name.","The more the linguistic Babel corroded and disorganized parliament, the closer drew the inevitable hour of the disintegration of this Babylonian Empire, and with it the hour of freedom for my German-Austrian people.","I believe in Providence and I believe Providence to be just. Therefore I believe that Providence always rewards the strong, the industrious, and the upright.","We are all proud that through God\'s powerful aid, we have become once more true Germans","Columbus\'s eggs lie around by the hundreds of thousands, but Columbuses are met with less frequency.","If Providence had not guided us I would often never have found these dizzy paths.  Thus, it is that we National Socialists have in the depths of our hearts our faith.  No man can fashion world history or the history of peoples unless upon his purpose and his powers there rests the blessing of this Providence.","The folkish philosophy is fundamentally distinguished from the Marxist by reason of the fact that the former recognizes the significance of race and therefore also personal worth and has made these the pillars of its structure. These are the most important factors of its view of life.","Truly, this earth is a trophy cup for the industrious man. And this rightly so, in the service of natural selection. He who does not possess the force to secure his Lebensraum in this world, and, if necessary, to enlarge it, does not deserve to possess the necessities of life. He must step aside and allow stronger peoples to pass him by.","All in all, this whole period of winter 1919-20 was a single struggle to strengthen confidence in the victorious might of the young movement and raise it to that fanaticism of faith which can move mountains.","This pride of race is a quality which the German, fundamentally, does not possess. The reason for this is that for these last three centuries the country has been torn by internal dissension and religious wars and has been subjected to a variety of foreign influences, to the influence, for example, of Christianity-for Christianity is not a natural religion for the Germans, but a religion that has been imported and which strikes no responsive chord in their hearts and is foreign to the inherent genius of the race. (13th February 1945)","In the life of nations, what in the last resort decides questions is a kind of Judgment Court of God... Always before god and the world the stronger has the right to carry through what he wills.","That this is possible may not be denied in a world where hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people voluntarily submit to celibacy, obligated and bound by nothing except the injunction of the Church. Should the same renunciation not be possible if this injunction is replaced by the admonition finally to put an end to the constant and continuous original sin of racial poisoning, and to give the Almighty Creator beings such as He Himself created?","If, on our own account, we do not intend to wage war, we are much less willing to do so for interests which do not concern Germany and are alien to it.","For we love liberty just as we love peace.","The thinking of the one, therefore, will be determined by eternal truth, the actions of the other more by the practical reality of the moment. The greatness of the one lies in the absolute abstract soundness of his idea.","All work which is necessary ennobles him who performs it.  Only one thing is shameful - to contribute nothing to the community.","By helping to raise man above the level of bestial vegetation, faith contributes in reality to the securing and safeguarding of his existence. Take away from present-day mankind its education-based, religious-dogmatic principles- or, practically speaking, ethical-moral principles- by abolishing this religious education, but without replacing it by an equivalent, and the result will be a grave shock to the foundations of their existence.","Germany will never break the peace of its own accord.","As soon as one point alone is removed from the sphere of dogmatic certainty, the discussion will not simply result in a new and better formulation which will have greater consistency but may easily lead to endless debates and general confusion.","Political parties has nothing to do with religious problems, as long as these are not alien to the nation, undermining the morals and ethics of the race; just as religion cannot be amalgamated with the scheming of political parties.","...we understand only the individual\'s capacity to make sacrifices for the community, for his fellow men.","What is necessary is to teach each class and profession the importance of the others.  All together form one mighty body; labourer, peasant, and professional man.","It [Christian Social Party] recognized the value of large-scale propaganda and was a virtuoso in influencing the psychological instincts of the broad masses of its adherents.","The disastrous consequences of widespread European butchery in the future would be even worse.","...we must pray to the Almighty not to refuse His blessing to this change and not to abandon our people in the times to come.","...it is said with such terrible justice that the sins of the fathers are avenged down to the tenth generation. But this applies only to profanation of the blood and the race.","For the political leader the religious doctrines and institutions of his people must always remain inviolable; or else has no right to be in politics, but should become a reformer, if he has what it takes!","I must frankly admit that... I should probably lose all interest in life and would rather not be a German at all. But since, thank the Lord, this cannot be done, we have no need to be surprised that the health, unspoiled people avoid \'bourgeois mass meetings\' as the devil holy water.","Never in these long years have we offered any other prayer but this: Lord, grant to our people peace at home, and grant and preserve to them peace from the foreign foe!","The Government, being resolved to undertake the political and moral purification of our public life, are creating and securing the conditions necessary for a really profound revival of religious life","When the German people trusting to the promises made by President Wilson in his Fourteen Points, laid down their arms in November 1918, a fateful struggle thereby came to an end for which perhaps individual statesmen, but certainly not the peoples themselves could be held responsible.\\n The German nation put up such an heroic fight because it was sincere in its conviction that it had been wrongfully attacked and was therefore justified in fighting. the Peace Treaty of Versailles did not seem to be for the purpose of restoring peace to mankind, but rather to perpetuate hatred.","The German people in its whole character is not warlike, but rather soldierly, that is, while they do not want war, they are not frightened by the thoughts of it.","Thus one of Europe\'s most serious crises will be ended, and all of us, not only in Germany but those far beyond our frontiers, will then in this year for the first time really rejoice at the Christmas festival. It should for us all be a true Festival of Peace.","I have no further interest in the Czecho-Slovakian State, that is guaranteed. We want no Czechs","It must never be forgotten that nothing that is really great in this world has ever been achieved by coalitions, but that it has always been the success of a single victor. Coalition successes bear by the very nature of their origin the germ of future crumbling, in fact of the loss of what has already been achieved. Great, truly world-shaking revolutions of a spiritual nature are not even conceivable and realizable except as the titanic struggles of individual formations, never as enterprises of coalitions.","Either we are a sovereign state, or we are not! As long as we are not, we have no business in a community of sovereign states.","As Fuehrer of the German people and Chancellor of the Reich, I can thank God at this moment that he has so wonderfully blessed us in our hard struggle for what is our right, and beg Him that we and all other nations may find the right way, so that not only the German people but all Europe may once more be granted the blessing of peace.","If Dr. Karl Lueger had lived in Germany, he would have been ranked among the great minds of our people.","Nationalist Socialist Germany wants peace because of its fundamental convictions. And it wants peace also owing to the realization of the simple primitive fact that no war would be likely essentially to alter the distress in Europe. The principal effect of every war is to destroy the flower of the nation. Germany needs peace and desires peace!","When I recall my teachers at school, I realise that half of them were abnormal. . . . We pupils of old Austria were brought up to respect old people and women. But on our professors we had no mercy; they were our natural enemies. The majority of them were somewhat mentally deranged, and quite a few ended their days as honest-to-God lunatics! . . . I was in particular bad odor with the teachers. I showed not the slightest aptitude for foreign languages - though I might have, had not the teacher been a congenital idiot. I could not bear the sight of him.","I will employ my strength for the welfare of the German people, protect the Constitution and laws of the German people, conscientiously discharge the duties imposed on me, and conduct my affairs of office impartially and with justice to everyone.","For it was by the Will of God that men were made of a certain bodily shape, were given their natures and their faculties. Whoever destroys His work wages war against God\'s Creation and God\'s Will.","Since we are not in the League of Nations in any case, we do not devote our attention to reflecting on its internal reforms.","The national Government sees in both Christian denominations the most important factor for the maintenance of our society.","The Party, as such, stands for positive Christianity, but does not bind itself in the matter of creed to any particular confession.","We have made it possible, without gold and without foreign exchange, to maintain the value of the German mark.  Behind the German mark stands the German capacity for work, while some foreign countries, suffocated by gold, have been compelled to devalue their currencies.","Man has discovered in nature the wonderful notion of that all-mighty being whose law he worships. Fundamentally in everyone there is the feeling for this all-mighty, which we call god (that is to say, the dominion of natural laws throughout the whole universe).","When Barbarossa commences, the world will hold its breath and make no comment.","I am quite sure that very few of the so-called Reds in Spain were really Communists. We were badly deceived, for, had I known the real state of affairs, I would never have allowed our aircraft to bombard and destroy a starving population and at the same time re-establish the Spanish clergy in all their horrible privileges. (10th February 1945)","It would be more in keeping with the intention of the noblest man in this world if our two Christian churches, instead of annoying Negroes with missions which they neither desire nor understand, would kindly, but in all seriousness, teach our European humanity that where parents are not healthy it is a deed pleasing to God to take pity on a poor little healthy orphan child and give him father and mother, than themselves to give birth to a sick child who will only bring unhappiness and suffering on himself and the rest of the world.","A people of scholars, if they are physically degenerate, weak-willed and cowardly pacifists, will not storm the heavens, indeed, they will not be able to safeguard their existence on this earth.","It is eastwards, only and always eastwards, that the veins of our race must expand. It is the direction which Nature herself has decreed for the expansion of the German peoples.","When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.","I have followed the Church in giving our party program the character of unalterable finality, like the Creed. The Church has never allowed the Creed to be interfered with. It is fifteen hundred years since it was formulated, but every suggestion for its amendment, every logical criticism, or attack on it, has been rejected.","Our object must be to bring our territory into harmony with the numbers of our population.","I wish to give officials greater discretion. The State\'s authority will be increased thereby. I wish to transform the non-political criminal police into a political instrument of the highest State authority.","Why should this war in the West be fought for the restoration of Poland? The Poland of the Versailles Treaty will never rise again.","Thank God I\'ve always avoided persecuting my enemies.","When over long periods of human history I scrutinized the activity of the Jewish people, suddenly there arose up in me the fearful question whether inscrutable Destiny, perhaps for reasons unknown to us poor mortals, did not, with eternal and immutable resolve, desire the final victory of this little nation.","The whole world may begin to burn, but the National Socialist State and Idea will emerge from the conflagration like platinum.","Whenever I think of this attack, my stomach turns over.","Once again the songs of the fatherland roared to the heavens along the endless marching columns, and for the last time the Lord\'s grace smiled on His ungrateful children.","Czechoslovakia has ceased to exist.","Christianity could not content itself with building up its own altar; it was absolutely forced to undertake the destruction of the heathen altars. Only from this fanatical intolerance could its apodictic faith take form; this intolerance is, in fact, its absolute presupposition.","There could be no issue between the Church and the State. The Church, as such, has nothing to do with political affairs. On the other hand, the State has nothing to do with the faith or inner organization of the Church","The fact that, with time, this League [of Nations]-which was presumably designed by its founders to exist for all eternity-cannot be coupled with a Treaty the short term of which is inherent in its own weaknesses and impracticabilities, is a point which can perhaps be contested by today\'s interested parties, but which will one day be deemed a matter of course in history.","He who would lay hands upon us will encounter thorns and barbs!","...the fall of man in paradise has always been followed by his expulsion.","The swine who stole my dog doesn\'t realize what he did to me!","I believe that Providence would never have allowed us to see the victory of the Movement if it had the intention after all to destroy us at the end.","Pressure or violence will ever move us to relinquish our honor or our equality of rights.","The hard struggle which the Pan-Germans fought with the Catholic Church can be accounted for only by their insufficient understanding of the spiritual nature of the people.","The principle applies here, help yourselves and Almighty God will not deny you his assistance.","Protestantism as such is a better defender of the interests of Germanism, in so far as this is grounded in its genesis and later tradition; it fails, however, in the moment when this defense of national interests must take place in a province which is either absent from the general line of its ideological world and traditional development, or is for some reason rejected.","The assertion that it is the intention of the German Reich to coerce the Austrian State is absurd!","Thus, Protestantism will always stand up for the advancement of all Germans as such, as long as matters of inner purity or national deepening as well as German freedom are involved, since all these things have a firm foundation in its own being; but it combats with the greatest hostility any attempt to rescue the nation from the embrace of its most mortal enemy, since its attitude toward the Jews just happens to be more or less dogmatically established.","Great, truly world-shaking revolutions of a spiritual nature are not even conceivable and realizable except as the titanic struggles of individual formations, never as enterprises of coalitions.","I soon realized that the correct use of propaganda is a true art which has remained practically unknown to the bourgeois parties. Only the Christian- Social movement, especially in Lueger\'s time achieved a certain virtuosity on this instrument, to which it owed many of its success.","On Positive Liberty: The business of the State is to use its organizing powers for the purpose of furnishing the necessary conditions which allow this people freely to unfold its creative faculties.","I may add that we have more than once stated our willingness to conclude nonaggression pacts with the states neighboring our own!","I hold that this must be said, for treaties only make sense when concluded by honor-loving peoples and honor-conscious governments. Germany wishes to establish honest relations with the peoples of neighboring countries. We have done this in the East, and I believe that not only Berlin but Warsaw as well will rejoice in the decontamination of the atmosphere brought about through our joint efforts.","In late marriage alone lies the compulsion to retain an institution which, twist and turn as you like, is and remains a disgrace to humanity, an institution which is damned ill-suited to a being who with his usual modesty likes to regard himself as the \'image\' of God.","The Government of the Reich, who regard Christianity as the unshakable foundation of the morals and moral code of the nation, attach the greatest value to friendly relations with the Holy See and are endeavouring to develop them.","We must, therefore, coolly and objectively adopt the standpoint that it can certainly not be the intention of Heaven to give one people fifty times as much land and soil in this world as another.","If in the past, after every lost war, the unlucky vanquished were divested forever of their honor and their equality of rights, the League of Nations would even now have to be satisfied with a whole series of non-equal and thus ultimately dishonorable and inferior nations.","Indeed, nearly all attempts to exterminate a doctrine and its organizational expression, by force without spiritual foundation, are doomed to failure, and not seldom end with the exact opposite of the desired result.","As long as the National Socialist Movement is leading Germany-and that will be the case for the next few centuries, no matter how often our emigrants conjure up the opposite view- this opinion will not change.","The task of preserving and advancing the highest humanity, given to this earth by the benevolence of the Almighty, seems a truly high mission.","Our present political world-view, current in Germany, is based in general on the idea that creative, culture-creating force must indeed be attributed to the state.","Thank the Lord, Germanic democracy means just this: that any old climber or moral slacker cannot rise by devious paths to govern his national comrades, but that, by the very greatness of the responsibility to be assumed, incompetents and weaklings are frightened of.","As soon as the theoretician attempts to take account of so-called \'utility\' and \'reality\' instead of absolute truth, his work will cease to be a polar star of seeking humanity and instead will become a prescription for everyday life.","Every healthy V\xf6lk sees the right to expansion of its living space as something natural.","Peoples which bastardize themselves, or let themselves be bastardized, sin against the will of eternal Providence.","Czechoslovakia provided Soviet Russia with landing fields for aircraft, thereby increasing the threat against Germany.","Not until my fourteenth or fifteenth year did I begin to come across the word \'Jew,\' with any frequency, partly in connection with political discussions.... For the Jew was still characterized for me by nothing but his religion, and therefore, on grounds of human tolerance, I maintained my rejection of religious attacks in this case as in others. Consequently, the tone, particularly that of the Viennese anti-Semitic press, seemed to me unworthy of the cultural tradition of a great nation.","The government will make use of these powers only insofar as they are essential for carrying out vitally necessary measures.... The separate existence of the federal states will not be done away.... The number of cases in which an internal necessity exists for having recourse to such law is in itself a limited one.","As National Socialists we see our program in our flag. In the red we see the social idea of the movement.","Consequently, the value and importance of the monarchic idea cannot reside in the person of the monarch himself except if Heaven decides to lay the crown on the brow of the heroic genius like Frederick the Great or a wise character like William I.","The main fighter for the DSP [Deutsch-Sozialistische Partei or German Socialist Party], as I have said, was Julius Streicher, then a teacher in Nuremberg. At first he, too, had a holy conviction of the mission and the future of his movement.","I demand that every Storm Troop Leader, just as every political leader, should be conscious of the fact that his behavior and conduct must be exemplary. . . . I wish every mother to give her son to The Party without fearing that he may be ruined morally. . . . Storm Troop Leaders who behave unworthily in public are to be mercilessly removed.","I ought to have seized the initiative in 1938 instead of allowing myself to be forced into war in 1939; for war was, in any case, unavoidable. However, you can hardly blame me if the British and the French accepted at Munich every demand I made of them! (14th February 1945)","Consequently, the tone, particularly that of the Viennese anti-Semitic press, seemed to me unworthy of the cultural tradition of a great nation.","The folkish state must not adjust its entire educational work primarily to the inoculation of mere knowledge, but to the breeding of absolutely healthy bodies. The training of mental abilities is only secondary.","God grant that this is the work of the Communists. You are witnessing the beginning of a great new epoch in German history. This fire is the beginning.","A victory at Kursk would shine like a beacon to the world!","Only a handful of Germans in the Reich had the slightest conception of the eternal and merciless struggle for the German language, German schools, and a German way of life. Only today, when the same deplorable misery is forced on many millions of Germans from the Reich, who under foreign rule dream of their common fatherland and strive, amid their longing, at least to preserve their holy right to their mother tongue, do wider circles understand what it means to be forced to fight for one\'s nationality.","They [German princes] made a pact with the devil and landed in hell.","You, my Brown Guard, will regard it as a matter of course that this German people should go only by the way which Providence ordained for it when it gave to Germans the common language. So we go forward with the profoundest faith in God into the future. Would that which we have achieved have been possible if Providence had not helped us?","When I compare myself and my opponents in other countries in the light of history, I do not fear the verdict on our respective mentalities.","Germany is prepared to agree to any solemn pact of non-aggression, because she does not think of attacking but only acquiring security.","More than once I was tormented by the thought that if Providence had put me in the place of the incapable of criminal incompetents or scoundrels in our propaganda service, our battle with Destiny would have taken a different turn.","I was not in agreement with the sharp anti-Semitic tone, but from time to time I read arguments which gave me some food for thought. At all events, these occasions slowly made me acquainted with the man and the movement, which in those days guided Vienna\'s destinies: Dr. Karl Lueger and the Christian Social Party.","The fight against syphilis demands a fight against prostitution, against prejudices, old habits, against previous conceptions, general views among them not least the false prudery of certain circles. The first prerequisite for even the moral right to combat these things is the facilitation of earlier marriage for the coming generation.","...our cities of the present lack the outstanding symbol of national community which, we must therefore not be surprised to find, sees no symbol of itself in the cities. The inevitable result is a desolation whose practical effect is the total indifference of the big-city dweller to the destiny of his city.","I drank my bottle of milk and ate my morsel of bread somewhere on the outskirts, while I circumspectly studied my environment or else fell to meditating on my own harsh lot.","Our party remains as firm as this rock and will not be divided by any force in Germany.","The great masses of people do not consist of philosophers; precisely for the masses, faith is often the sole foundation of a moral attitude. ... For the political man, the value of a religion must be estimated less by its deficiencies than by the virtue of a visibly better substitute.","Every year a thousand kilometers of motor-roads will be opened until the greatest work in the history of mankind is completed.","[It is] useful to know the laws of nature - for that enables us to obey them. To act otherwise would be to rise in revolt against heaven.","It is not the State that orders us; but it is we who order the State!","It is over, the Reich walls have collapsed, my generals have betrayed me and my army refuses to fight, this is the herr Doernitz! I only hope you can turn this around.","The man and the movement seemed \'reactionary\' in my eyes. My common sense of justice, however, forced me to change this judgment in proportion as I had occasion to become acquainted with the man and his work; and slowly my fair judgment turned to unconcealed admiration. Today, more than ever, I regard this man as the greatest German mayor of all times.","It is the last territorial claim which I have to make in Europe, but it is a claim from which I will not recede and which, God willing, I will make good.","Soldiers of the Reich! This day, you are to take part in an offensive of such importance that the whole future of the war may depend on its outcome.","Germany has solemnly recognized and guaranteed France her frontiers as determined after the Saar plebiscite... We thereby finally renounced all claims to Alsace-Lorraine, a land for which we have fought two great wars.","I have never liked France or the French, and I have never stopped saying so. (15th February 1945)","In order to persuade Britain to pack up, to compel her to make peace, it was essential to rob her of her hope of being able still to confront us, on the continent itself, with an adversary of a stature equal to our own.","Wipe out the entire defense potential remaining to the Soviets.","A sharp difference should exist between general education and specialized knowledge. As particularly today the latter threatens more and more to sink into the service of pure Mammon, general education, at least in its more ideal attitude, must be retained as a counterweight.","May the time not be far off when all other European nations will come to the realisation that the primary necessity is putting an end to the quarrels and strife of centuries and of building up of a finer community of all peoples is: The recognition of a higher common duty arising out of common rights?","But it would be absolutely mistaken to regard a wealth of theoretical knowledge as characteristic proof for the qualities and abilities of a leader.","...the unprecedented rise of the Christian Social Party... was to assume the deepest significance for me as a classical object of study.","I believe that the madness of Communism would be the sole victor.","German equality of rights is the prerequisite for any participation on Germany\'s part in international conventions and agreements.","I hold to my conviction that, once this path of mutual understanding and consideration has been taken, more will come of it in the end than through ever so extensive pacts inherently lacking in clarity.","I certainly am not alone in the world with this demand; I am in the best of company. Let it be said that no self-respecting people and no responsible government would be able to think or much less act differently in such a case. The world has already seen a great many wars lost in the past.","Do not compare yourself to others. If you do so, you are insulting yourself.","if you want to shine like sun first you have to burn like it.","The man who has no sense of history, is like a man who has no ears or eyes","Only the Jew knew that by an able and persistent use of propaganda heaven itself can be presented to the people as if it were hell and, vice versa, the most miserable kind of life can be presented as if it were paradise. The Jew knew this and acted accordingly. But the German, or rather his Government, did not have the slightest suspicion of it. During the War the heaviest of penalties had to be paid for that ignorance.-- Mein Kampf, Chapter 10","The stronger must dominate and not mate with the weaker, which would signify the sacrifice of its own higher nature. Only the born weakling can look upon this principle as cruel, and if he does so it is merely because he is of a feebler nature and narrower mind; for if such a law did not direct the process of evolution then the higher development of organic life would not be conceivable at all.","To conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens.","\u0644\u0642\u062f \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0648\u0633\u0639\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0642\u0636\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u0644 \u064a\u0647\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a \u062a\u0631\u0643\u062a \u0628\u0639\u0636\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0623\u0628\u064a\u062f\u0647\u0645","Instruction in world history in the so-called high schools is even today in a very sorry condition. Few teachers understand that the study of history can never be to learn historical dates and events by heart and recite them by rote; that what matters is not whether the child knows exactly when this battle or that was fought, when a general was born, or even when a monarch (usually a very insignificant one) came into the crown of his forefathers. No, by the living God, this is very unimportant. To \'learn\' history means to seek and find the forces which are the causes leading to those effects which we subsequently perceive as historical events.","Kill, Destroy, Sack, Tell lie; how much you want after victory nobody asks why?-- uncited source","As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice.-- Speeches","The frailest woman will become a heroine when the life of her own child is at stake. And only the will to save the race and native land or the State, which offers protection to the race, has in all ages been the urge which has forced men to face the weapons of their enemies.","While the Zionists try to make the rest of the World believe that the national consciousness of the Jew finds its satisfaction in the creation of a Palestinian state, the Jews again slyly dupe the dumb Goyim. It doesn\'t even enter their heads to build up a Jewish state in Palestine for the purpose of living there; all they want is a central organisation for their international world swindler, endowed with its own sovereign rights and removed from the intervention of other states: a haven for convicted scoundrels and a university for budding crooks.

Hence its struggle is less defensive than offensive. It therefore has the advantage even in determining the goal, since this goal represents the victory of its own idea, while, conversely,it is hard to determine when the negative aim of the destruction of a hostile doctrine may be regarded as achieved and assured. For this reason alone, the philosophy\'s offensive will be more systematic and also more powerful than the defensive against a philosophy, since here, too, as always, the attack and not the defence makes the decision. The fight against a spiritual power with methods of violence remains defensive, however, until the sword becomes the support,the herald and disseminator, of a new spiritual doctrine.","Conozco a personas que \u201cleen much\xedsimo, libro tras libro y l\xednea a l\xednea, y a las que, sin embargo, no calificar\xeda de \u201cbuenos lectores\u201d.

Of course they \'know\' an immense amount; buttheir brain seems incapable of assorting and classifying the material which they havegathered from books. They have not the faculty of distinguishing between what isuseful and useless in a book; so that they may retain the former in their minds and ifpossible skip over the latter while reading it, if that be not possible, then--when onceread--throw it overboard as useless ballast. Reading is not an end in itself, but a meansto an end. Its chief purpose is to help towards filling in the framework which is madeup of the talents and capabilities that each individual possesses. Thus each one procuresfor himself the implements and materials necessary for the fulfilment of his calling inlife, no matter whether this be the elementary task of earning one\'s daily bread or acalling that responds to higher human aspirations. Such is the first purpose of reading.And the second purpose is to give a general knowledge of the world in which we live.In both cases, however, the material which one has acquired through reading must notbe stored up in the memory on a plan that corresponds to the successive chapters of thebook; but each little piece of knowledge thus gained must be treated as if it were a littlestone to be inserted into a mosaic, so that it finds its proper place among all the otherpieces and particles that help to form a general world-picture in the brain of the reader.Otherwise only a confused jumble of chaotic notions will result from all this reading.That jumble is not merely useless, but it also tends to make the unfortunate possessor ofit conceited. For he seriously considers himself a well-educated person and thinks thathe understands something of life. He believes that he has acquired knowledge, whereasthe truth is that every increase in such \'knowledge\' draws him more and more awayfrom real life, until he finally ends up in some sanatorium or takes to politics andbecomes a parliamentary deputy.Such a person never succeeds in turning his knowledge to practical account when theopportune moment arrives; for his mental equipment is not ordered with a view tomeeting the demands of everyday life. His knowledge is stored in his brain as a literaltranscript of the books he has read and the order of succession in which he has readthem. And if Fate should one day call upon him to use some of his book-knowledge forcertain practical ends in life that very call will have to name the book and give thenumber of the page; for the poor noodle himself would never be able to find the spotwhere he gathered the information now called for. But if the page is not mentioned atthe critical moment the widely-read intellectual will find himself in a state of hopelessembarrassment.

I do wash my hands very frequently, on account of the dog. But with the old peace-time soap, I became very sore. Why is that?","If my presence on earth is providential, I owe it to a superior will. But I owe nothing to the Church that trafficks in the salvation of souls, and I find it really too cruel. I admit that one cannot impose one\'s will by force, but I have a horror of people who enjoy inflicting sufferings on others\' bodies and tyranny upon others\' souls. Our epoch will certainly see the end of the disease of Christianity. It will last another hundred years, two hundred years perhaps. My regret will have been that I couldn\'t, like whoever the prophet was, behold the promised land from afar. We are entering into a conception of the world that will be a sunny era, an era of tolerance. Man must be put in a position to develop freely the talents that God has given him.What is important above all is that we should prevent a greater lie from replacing the lie that is disappearing. The world of Judaeo-Bolshevism must collapse.","Uncertainty cripples any serious and firm resolve and results in opinions swaying from one side to the other, leaving any decision that is made weak and half done, even when it comes to the most essential measures of self-preservation.","Una acci\xf3n social no puede exigir el tributo de la gratitud porque ella no prodiga mercedes, sino que est\xe1 destinada a restituir derechos.","Social prejudices are in the process of disappearing. More and more, nature is reclaiming her rights. We\'re moving in the proper direction. I\'ve much more respect for the woman who has an illegitimate child than for an old maid. I\'ve often been told of unmarried women who had children and brought these children up in a truly touching manner. It often happens amongst women servants, notably. The women who have no children finally go off their heads.It\'s somewhat striking to observe that in the majority of peoples the number of women exceeds that of men. What harm is there, then, in every woman\'s fulfilling her destiny? I love to see this display of health around me. The opposite thing would make me misanthropic. And I\'d become really so, if all I had to look at were the spectacle of the ten thousand so-called \xe9lite. Luckily for me, I\'ve always retained contacts with the people. Amongst the people, moral health is obligatory. It goes so far that in the country one never reproaches a priest for having a liaison with his servant. People even regard it as a kind of guarantee : the women and girls of the village need not protect themselves. In any case, women of the people are full of understanding; they admit that a young priest can\'t sweat his sperm out through his brain.The hypocrites are to be found amongst the ten-thousandstrong \xe9lite. That\'s where one meets the Puritan who can reproach his neighbour for his adventures, forgetting that he has himself married a divorc\xe9e. Everybody should draw from his own experience the reasons to show himself indulgent towards others. Marriage, as it is practised in bourgeoise society, is generally a thing against nature. But a meeting between two beings who complete one another, who are made for one another, borders already, in my conception, upon a miracle.I often think of those women who people the convents\u2014because they haven\'t met the man with whom they would have wished to share their lives. With the exception of those who were promised to God by their parents, most of them, in fact, are women cheated by life. Human beings are made to suffer passively. Rare are the beings capable of coming to grips with existence.","I do not believe that one can maintain a situation in which a man toils and works a whole year, only to get a ludicrous salary, and another just sits down in a leather seat and gets enormous sums for it. This is a condition unworthy of man. [-] After all, there are two worlds which confront each other. And they are right when they say: \u201cWe can never reconcile ourselves to the National Socialist world. For how could a narrow-minded capitalist possibly declare his agreement with my principles? It would be easier for the devil to go to church and take holy water. [-] This is the first state in our German history which, as a matter of principle, eliminated all social prejudice in the assignment of social positions, and this not only in civilian life. I myself am the best proof of that. I am not even an advocate; just think of what this means! And still I am your Fuhrer! [-] What was it that I asked of the outside world Nothing but the right of Germans to unite, and second, that what was taken away from them be restored. I asked for nothing which might have implied a loss for another people.How often have I offered my hand to them Immediately after my rise to power. For what does armament mean? It gobbles up so much manpower. And especially I who regard work as the decisive factor, I had wished to employ German manpower for other plans.And, my Volksgenossen, I believe it became common knowledge that I have plans of some substance, beautiful and great plans for my Volk. I have the ambition to make the German Volk rich, the German lands beautiful. I wish the standard of living of the individual to increase. I wish us to develop the most beautiful and best culture. I wish theater to be an enjoyment affordable for the entire Volk and not only for the upper ten thousand as in England. Beyond this, I wish the entirety of German culture to benefit the Volk. These were enormous plans which we possessed, and for their realization I needed manpower.Armament just takes men away. I made proposals to restrict armament. But all they did was laugh at me. [-] For it was quite clear: what was I before the World War? An unknown, nameless man. What was I during the War? A small, common soldier. I bore no responsibility for the World War. But who are the folk who lead England once again today The very same people who were already agitating before the World War. It is the same Churchill, who was already the vilest warmonger in the World War, and the late Chamberlain who agitated just as much then. And the whole audience (Korona) that belongs there, and naturally that people which always believes that with the trumpets of Jericho it can destroy the peoples: these are the old specters which have arisen once more!Adolf Hitler \u2013 speech to the workers of a Berlin December 10, 1940\u201d","Thus the home-front need not be warned, and the prayer of this priest of the devil, the wish that Europe may be punished with Bolshevism, will not be fulfilled, but rather that the prayer may be fulfilled: \\"Lord God, give us the strength that we may retain our liberty for our children and our children\'s children, not only for ourselves but also for the other peoples of Europe, for this is a war which we all wage, this time, not for our German people alone, it is a war for all of Europe and with it, in the long run, for all of mankind.Speech in the Sportpalast, Berlin, January 30, 1942","Even so\u2014think of the declaration of war in 1939! They had no armaments at all\u2014and yet they declared war ! In those days they had, I believe, six divisions. It\'s quite possible that they will again let themselves be hoodwinked by fairy tales from the emigres. The soldiers, I know, were against war. But there are people over there who don\'t give a damn if Britain does collapse\u2014yes, I mean the Jews ! There are others who say : \\"If the Russians are beaten, then we shall be the war criminals \u2014there will be trials, and we shall end up in the Tower.\\" The soldiers will defend themselves by saying that they had given full warning of the danger Britain ran in accepting the risks of undertaking an invasion. But for the politicians who declared war and the Jews who drove them to it there is no defence ! And these latter are quite capable of risking a second attempt. On the other hand, they may say to themselves : we are taking on an opponent who has so far knocked the teeth out of everybody who has opposed him.","One may be repelled by this law of nature which demands that all living things should mutually devour one another. The fly is snapped up by a dragon-fly, which itself is swallowed by a bird, which itself falls victim to a larger bird. This last, as it grows old, becomes a prey to microbes, which end by getting the better of it. These microbes, in their turn, find their predestined ends.","The short-sighted refusal to make an effort towards improving labor conditions, the refusal to adopt measures which would insure the workman in case of accidents in the factories, the refusal to forbid child labor, the refusal to consider protective measures for female workers, especially expectant mothers - all this was of assistance to the Social Democratic leaders, who were thankful for every opportunity which they could exploit for forcing the masses into their net. Our bourgeois parties can never repair the damage that resulted from the mistake they then made. For they sowed the seeds of hatred when they opposed all efforts at social reform.","When the Habsburg State crumbled to pieces in 1918 the Austrian Germans instinctively raised an outcry for union with their German fatherland. That was the voice of a unanimous yearning in the hearts of the whole people for a return to the unforgotten home of their fathers.","We took perhaps the greatest step in the inner order. Everything else in innumerable areas is now connected to it. And here I\u2019d like to return to the starting point of my remarks, namely, to the concept of \u201cworldview. I said that worldview is nothing more than the consideration of the entire world in its phenomena from a uniform standpoint of the latest scientific discoveries, serious discoveries. And I went after all other problems in the same way. We solved our economic questions, gentlemen, when all the so-called experts claimed they couldn\u2019t be solved. We solved our cultural problems. What didn\u2019t they say earlier! They said, \u201cWhat? You want to eliminate the Jews? Ha ha! Then you won\u2019t have any more money, you won\u2019t have any more gold\u201d. As if the Jews were a gold-producing element! Gold only has any meaning when it represents value. Values are not created by Jews, but rather, by people who have invented valuable things, or produced them. The Jew simply inserts himself between the inventor or producer and the consumer. He is a valve that restricts the flow. I built a valve which can cut off the flow when needed or let it flow again, at will. When I was young I often went to the German Museum in Munich. That was the first great technical museum at that time. I had a tremendous interest in it \u2013 almost the entire inventiveness of the human race is represented there. What was ever invented by Jews? The Jews, who rule everything, the whole economic system, our industrial life, they rule everything! \u2013 What did they ever invent? Where are the Jewish inventors? There\u2019s not a single one there! Not one! You can raise the same question in cultural life. People have said to me, \u201cSo when you kick out the Jews, you can say goodbye to the theatre! But who really founded our culture? Was it the Jews? Who were our Jewish composers? Who were our great poets? Were our great thinkers [illegible] Jews, perhaps? How do the Jews suddenly succeed in inserting themselves into the production of the same goods that were created by the greatest Germans, or the discoveries that originated with the greatest Germans? Experiment showed that I was right. I removed the Jews; German theatres are full as never before. German film is flowering as never before. German literature, the German press, is being read as never before, better than ever before. Much better! We swept away vulgarities in innumerable fields, without ever falling victim to a prudery of the past. Since here we know a principle, namely, the maintenance of our race, our species. Everything that serves this principle is correct. Everything that detracts from it is wrong.The F\xfchrer\'s talk to Generals and Officers on May 26, 1944 at the Platterhof in Obersaltzberg\u201d","Bu \xf6\u011fretmen Linz Realschule\'sindeki doktor Leopold Poetsch idi ve bu meziyetleri \u015fahs\u0131nda toplam\u0131\u015ft\u0131.

Attempts at assassination may be repeated. I am convinced of my powers of intellect and of decision. Wars are always ended only by the annihilation of the opponent.Anyone who believes differently is irresponsible. Time is working for our adversaries. Now there is a relationship of forces which can never be more propitious for us. No compromises. Hardness toward ourselves. I shall strike and not capitulate.The fate of the Reich depends only on me.No one has ever achieved what I have achieved. My life is of no importance in all this. I have led the German people to a great height, even if the world does hate us now. I am setting this work on a gamble. I have to choose between victory or annihilation. I choose victory. Greatest historical choice, to be compared with the decision of Frederick the Great before the first Silesian war. Prussia owes its rise to the heroism of one man. Even there the closest advisers were disposed to capitulation. Everything depended on Frederick the Great. Also the decisions of Bismarck in 1866 and 1870 were no less great.Speech to the OKW Flensburg, November 23, 1939","Cleanliness, whether moral or of another kind, had its own peculiar meaning for these people.

Beyond that there were the unkempt clothes and the ignoble exterior.","On the whole earth there\'s no being, no substance, and probably no human institution that doesn\'t end by growing old.

If somebody characterizes the morale of a regiment as bad, then the regiment\u2019s commander is responsible for this. A leader is always responsible for his followers. He passes his own spirit on to his followers. If he shows signs of weakness, then his followers will also become weak. If he shows signs of resistance and valor, then his followers will resist and will be valiant. If he shows signs of heroism, then his followers will die heroically. If he shows signs of cowardly capitulation, then his followers will capitulate. The leader of any organization is not only the bearer of its shield. He also fashions its character, its valor. And, in turn, in this sense, he is also responsible for its defeatism. You must hence pass on the faith and insights which you possess to your followers. They must believe in you. And you must always and at all times be the banner, the living banner, behind which they march, an example in all things to the soldier. If this idea continues to suffuse the entire Wehrmacht to the extent which we are already witnessing today to our great joy and pride-then this Wehrmacht will be invincible. And then this age in which we live will not only be a great age for all of us now, but it will also be regarded as an age of enlightenment by future generations. Just as we think with shame of the years 1918, 1919, 1920, 1921, and so on, so posterity will think with pride and joy of the age we are fashioning at present. Then, we will have done our duty. A man cannot expect more from life. Everyone will die sooner or later. Thus, there is only one question: how did he live his life? Did he live decently? Did he live courageously? Did he live faithfully and did he fulfill his duties? Or did he live like a drone among his Volk? Did he live as one of those who go with the flow of lethargy or apathy? That is the question.And if there is one reason for living, then it is to be able to say in one\u2019s old age: \u201cFor my part, I did my duty. I always was indifferent to what the others did. When one day you look back to this age, I wish that you will be able to do one thing: to look back with a feeling of pride: \u201cBack then, when the Greater German Reich was fighting for its destiny, I was a soldier. I was an officer back then and I did my duty for this eternal Germany!\u201d","Our duty is to teach men to see whatever is lovely and truly wonderful in life, and not to become prematurely ill-tempered and spiteful. We wish fully to enjoy what is beautiful, to cling to it\u2014and to avoid, as far as possible, anything that might do harm to people like ourselves.If to-day you do harm to the Russians, it is so as to avoid giving them the opportunity of doing harm to us.God does not act differently. He suddenly hurls the masses of humanity on to the earth, and he leaves it to each one to work out his own salvation. Men dispossess one another, and one perceives that, at the end of it all, it is always the stronger who triumphs. Is that not the most reasonable order of things?If it were otherwise, nothing good would ever have existed. If we did not respect the laws of nature, imposing our will by the right of the stronger, a day would come when the wild animals would once again devour us\u2014then the insects would eat the wild animals, and finally nothing would exist on earth but the microbes.","A decayed body is not made the least more aesthetic by a brilliant mind, indeed the highest intellectual training could not be justified if its bearers were at the same time physically degenerate and crippled, weak-minded, wavering and cowardly individuals.

I have never regarded the Chinese or the Japanese as being inferior to ourselves. They belong to ancient civilisations, and I admit freely that their past history is superior to our own. They have the right to be proud of their past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilisation to which we belong. Indeed, I believe the more steadfast the Chinese and the Japanese remain in their pride of race, the easier I shall find it to get on with them.","To \u2018learn\u2018 history means to seek and find the forces which are the causes leading to those effects which we subsequently perceive as historical events.","The art of reading as of learning is this: to retain the essential to forget the non-essential.","Kitaplar hayat m\xfccadelesine at\u0131lm\u0131\u015f olanlara veya b\xfcy\xfck ideal sahiplerinin geni\u015f ufuklar\u0131na, yani ufuklar katmakta yard\u0131mc\u0131 olurlar.

One couldn\'t imagine a better activity on nature\'s part than that which consists in deciding the supremacy of one creature over another by means of a constant struggle. While we\'re on the subject, it\'s somewhat interesting to observe that our upper classes, who\'ve never bothered about the hundreds of thousands of German emigrants or their poverty, give way to a feeling of compassion regarding the fate of the Jews whom we claim the right to expel. Our compatriots forget too easily that the Jews have accomplices all over the world, and that no beings have greater powers of resistance as regards adaptation to climate. Jews can prosper anywhere, even in Lapland and Siberia. All that love and sympathy, since our ruling class is capable of such sentiments, would by rights be applied exclusively\u2014if that class were not corrupt\u2014to the members of our national community. Here Christianity sets the example. What could be more fanatical, more exclusive and more intolerant than this religion which bases everything on the love of the one and only God whom it reveals? The affection that the German ruling class should devote to the good fellow-citizen who faithfully and courageously does his duty to the benefit of the community, why is it not just as fanatical, just as exclusive and just as intolerant?My attachment and sympathy belong in the first place to the front-line German soldier, who has had to overcome the rigours of the past winter. If there is a question of choosing men to rule us, it must not be forgotten that war is also a manifestation of life, that it is even life\'s most potent and most characteristic expression. Consequently, I consider that the only men suited to become rulers are those who have valiantly proved themselves in a war. In my eyes, firmness of character is more precious than any other quality. A well toughened character can be the characteristic of a man who, in other respects, is quite ignorant. In my view, the men who should be set at the head of an army are the toughest, bravest, boldest, and, above all, the most stubborn and hardest to wear down. The same men are also the best chosen for posts at the head of the State\u2014otherwise the pen ends by rotting away what the sword has conquered. I shall go so far as to say that, in his own sphere, the statesman must be even more courageous than the soldier who leaps from his trench to face the enemy. There are cases, in fact, in which the courageous decision of a single statesman can save the lives of a great number of soldiers. That\'s why pessimism is a plague amongst statesmen. One should be able to weed out all the pessimists, so that at the decisive moment these men\'s knowledge may not inhibit their capacity for action.This last winter was a case in point. It supplied a test for the type of man who has extensive knowledge, for all the bookworms who become preoccupied by a situation\'s analogies, and are sensitive to the generally disastrous epilogue of the examples they invoke. Agreed, those who were capable of resisting the trend needed a hefty dose of optimism. One conclusion is inescapable: in times of crisis, the bookworms are too easily inclined to switch from the positive to the negative. They\'re waverers who find in public opinion additional encouragement for their wavering. By contrast, the courageous and energetic optimist\u2014even although he has no wide knowledge\u2014 will always end, guided by his subconscious or by mere commonsense, in finding a way out.","To teach a nation the handling of arms is to give it a virile education. If the Romans had not recruited Germans in their armies, the latter would never have had the opportunity of becoming soldiers and, eventually, of annihilating their former instructors. The most striking example is that of Arminius, who became Commander of the Third Roman Legion. The Romans instructed the Third in the arts of war, and Arminius afterwards used it to defeat his instructors. At the time of the revolt against Rome, the most daring of Arminius\' brothers-in-arms were all Germanics who had served some time or other in the Roman legions.","En el momento en que los pueblos de este planeta luchan por su existencia, esto es, cuando se les hace inminente el problema decisivo de ser o no ser, quedan reducidas a la nada las consideraciones humanitarias o est\xe9ticas. Porque esas ideas se originan m\xe1s bien en la imaginaci\xf3n de los hombres con seguridad existencial. Con su marcha de este mundo, desaparecen tambi\xe9n esas ideas, pues la Naturaleza las desconoce. Incluso entre los hombres ellas son propias s\xf3lo de algunos pueblos o, mejor, de ciertas razas, en la medida que \xe9stas provienen del sentimiento de esos mismos pueblos o razas. El sentimiento humanitario y est\xe9tico desaparecer\xeda, hasta incluso de un mundo habitado, una vez que desaparecieran las razas creadoras y portadoras de esas ideas. Todas esas ideas tienen un significado secundario en la lucha de un pueblo por su propia existencia; llegan incluso a desaparecer, una vez que puedan contrariar su instinto de conservaci\xf3n. Por lo que al humanitarismo respecta, ya Moltke dijo que en la guerra lo humanitario radicaba en la celeridad del procedimiento; es decir, que estaba en relaci\xf3n directa con el empleo de los medios de lucha m\xe1s eficaces. A aquellos que procuran argumentar en esos temas con palabras tales como est\xe9tica y otras, se les puede responder de la siguiente manera: las cuestiones vitales de la importancia de la lucha por la vida de un pueblo anulan todas las consideraciones de orden est\xe9tico. La mayor fealdad en la vida humana es y ser\xe1 siempre el yugo de la esclavitud.","In addition, I had the greatest interest in anything connected with politics, but this did not seem to me very significant.

Because man has made laws he subsequently comes to think that he exists for the sake of the laws.","Now for the first time I learned to know men and I learned to distinguish between empty appearances or brutal manners and the real inner nature of the people who outwardly appeared thus.","Obstacles are placed across our path in life, not to be boggled at but to be surmounted.","I can fight only for something that I love. I can love only what I respect, and in order to respect a thing I must at least have some knowledge of it.","What is contrary to the visible truth must change or disappear\u2014that\'s the law of life.We have this advantage over our ancestors of a thousand years ago, that we can see the past in depth, which they couldn\'t. We have this other advantage, that we can see it in breadth\u2014an ability that likewise escaped them. For a world population of two thousand two hundred and fifty millions, one can count on the earth a hundred and seventy religions of a certain importance\u2014each of them claiming, of course, to be the repository of the truth. At least a hundred and sixty-nine of them, therefore, are mistaken! Amongst the religions practised to-day, there is none that goes back further than two thousand five hundred years. But there have been human beings, in the baboon category, for at least three hundred thousand years. There is less distance between the man-ape and the ordinary modern man than there is between the ordinary modern man and a man like Schopenhauer. In comparison with this millenary past, what does a period of two thousand years signify?The universe, in its material elements, has the same composition whether we\'re speaking of the earth, the sun or any other planet. It is impossible to suppose nowadays that organic life exists only on our planet.Does the knowledge brought by science make men happy? That I don\'t know. But I observe that man can be happy by deluding himself with false knowledge. I grant one must cultivate tolerance.It\'s senseless to encourage man in the idea that he\'s a king of creation, as the scientist of the past century tried to make him believe. That same man who, in order to get about quicker, has to straddle a horse\u2014that mammiferous, brainless being! I don\'t know a more ridiculous claim.The Russians were entitled to attack their priests, but they had no right to assail the idea of a supreme force. It\'s a fact that we\'re feeble creatures, and that a creative force exists. To seek to deny it is folly. In that case, it\'s better to believe something false than not to believe anything at all. Who\'s that little Bolshevik professor who claims to triumph over creation? People like that, we\'ll break them. Whether we rely on the catechism or on philosophy, we have possibilities in reserve, whilst they, with their purely materialistic conceptions, can only devour one another.","I know nothing of the Other World, and I have the honesty to admit it. Other people know more about it than I do, and I\'m incapable of proving that they\'re mistaken. I don\'t dream of imposing my philosophy on a village girl. Although religion does not aim at seeking for the truth, it is a kind of philosophy which can satisfy simple minds, and that does no harm to anyone. Everything is finally a matter of the feeling man has of his own impotence. In itself, this philosophy has nothing pernicious about it. The essential thing, really, is that man should know that salvation consists in the effort that each person makes to understand Providence and accept the laws of nature.Since all violent upheavals are a calamity, I would prefer the adaptation to be made without shocks. What could be longest left undisturbed are women\'s convents. The sense of the inner life brings people great enrichment. What we must do, then, is to extract from religions the poison they contain. In this respect, great progress has been made during recent centuries. The Church must be made to understand that her kingdom is not of this world. What an example Frederick the Great set when he reacted against the Church\'s claim to be allowed to interfere in matters of State ! The marginal notes, in his handwriting, which one finds on the pleas addressed to him by the pastors, have the value of judgments of Solomon. They\'re definitive. Our generals should make a practice of reading them daily. One is humiliated to see how slowly humanity progresses.","Christ was an Aryan, and St. Paul used his doctrine to mobilise the criminal underworld and thus organise a proto-Bolshevism. This intrusion upon the world marks the end of a long reign, that of the clear Graeco-Latin genius.What is this God who takes pleasure only in seeing men grovel before Him? Try to picture to yourselves the meaning of the following, quite simple story. God creates the conditions for sin. Later on He succeeds, with the help of the Devil, in causing man to sin. Then He employs a virgin to bring into the world a son who, by His death, will redeem humanity!I can imagine people being enthusiastic about the paradise of Mahomet, but as for the insipid paradise of the Christians ! In your lifetime, you used to hear the music of Richard Wagner. After your death, it will be nothing but hallelujahs, the waving of palms, children of an age for the feeding-bottle, and hoary old men. The man of the isles pays homage to the forces of nature. But Christianity is an invention of sick brains : one could imagine nothing more senseless, nor any more indecent way of turning the idea of the Godhead into a mockery. A negro with his tabus is crushingly superior to the human being who seriously believes in Transubstantiation.I begin to lose all respect for humanity when I think that some people on our side, Ministers or generals, are capable of believing that we cannot triumph without the blessing of the Church. Such a notion is excusable in little children who have learnt nothing else.For thirty years the Germans tore each other to pieces simply in order to know whether or not they should take Communion in both kinds. There\'s nothing lower than religious notions like that. From that point of view, one can envy the Japanese. They have a religion which is very simple and brings them into contact with nature. They\'ve succeeded even in taking Christianity and turning it into a religion that\'s less shocking to the intellect.By what would you have me replace the Christians\' picture of the Beyond? What comes naturally to mankind is the sense of eternity and that sense is at the bottom of every man. The soul and the mind migrate, just as the body returns to nature. Thus life is eternally reborn from life. As for the \\"why?\\" of all that, I feel no need to rack my brains on the subject. The soul is unplumbable.If there is a God, at the same time as He gives man life He gives him intelligence. By regulating my life according to the understanding that is granted me, I may be mistaken, but I act in good faith. The concrete image of the Beyond that religion forces on me does not stand up to examination. Think of those who look down from on high upon what happens on earth: what a martyrdom for them, to see human beings indefatigably repeating the same gestures, and inevitably the same errors !In my view, H. S. Chamberlain was mistaken in regarding Christianity as a reality upon the spiritual level.Man judges everything in relation to himself. What is bigger than himself is big, what is smaller is small. Only one thing is certain, that one is part of the spectacle. Everyone finds his own r\xf4le. Joy exists for everybody. I dream of a state of affairs in which every man would know that he lives and dies for the preservation of the species. It\'s our duty to encourage that idea : let the man who distinguishes himself in the service of the species be thought worthy of the highest honours.","One must act radically. When one pulls out a tooth, one does it with a single tug, and the pain quickly goes away. The Jew must clear out of Europe. Otherwise no understanding will be possible between Europeans. It\'s the Jew who prevents everything. When I think about it, I realise that I\'m extraordinarily humane. At the time of the rule of the Popes, the Jews were mistreated in Rome. Until 1830, eight Jews mounted on donkeys were led once a year through the streets of Rome. For my part, I restrict myself to telling them they must go away. If they break their pipes on the journey, I can\'t do anything about it. But if they refuse to go voluntarily, I see no other solution but extermination. Why should I look at a Jew through other eyes than if he were a Russian prisoner-of-war? In the p.o.w. camps, many are dying. It\'s not my fault. I didn\'t want either the war or the p.o.w. camps. Why did the Jew provoke this war? A good three hundred or four hundred years will go by before the Jews set foot again in Europe. They\'ll return first of all as commercial travellers, then gradually they\'ll become emboldened to settle here\u2014the better to exploit us. In the next stage, they become philanthropists, they endow foundations. When a Jew does that, the thing is particularly noticed\u2014for it\'s known that they\'re dirty dogs. As a rule, it\'s the most rascally of them who do that sort of thing. And then you\'ll hear these poor Aryan boobies telling you : \\"You see, there are good Jews !\\"Let\'s suppose that one day National Socialism will undergo a change, and become used by a caste of privileged persons who exploit the people and cultivate money. One must hope that in that case a new reformer will arise and clean up the stables.","This method is: first, to create better fundamental conditions of social development by establishing a profound feeling for social responsibilities among the public; second, to combine this feeling for social responsibilities with a ruthless determination to prune away all excrescences which are incapable of being improved. Just","But as far as I personally am concerned I could not bear to live in Germany during the transition period that would follow the defeat of the Third Reich. The ignominies and the treachery we experienced in 1918 will be as nothing in comparison with what we may now expect. It is beyond comprehension that, after twelve years of National Socialism, such a thing could happen. My imagination boggles at the idea of a Germany, henceforth deprived of her elite which led her to the very pinnacles of heroism, wallowing for years and years in the mire.","When the war came to this tragic end for Germany, I had to first say goodbye to my only great passion in this life and I decided, based on my living experience, to undertake the reorganisation of a new German racial corpus. I say \u201cbody of the people, already something different from what many other German politicians had in mind. The bourgeois politicians only saw the State before their eyes, I saw the people, the substance. For me, the State was nothing more than a purely exterior, even a compulsory form. I had then already come to see that that which we call the State is, in reality, the overcoming of the inborn individualistic self-drive in people\u2014that one can\u2019t start anything with the State, especially in reorganising, rather that the \u201cbody of the people\u201d was the primary and decisive thing, that the body of the people must therefore be reorganised.\u201d","Today the Siberians, the White Russians, and the people of the steppes live extremely healthy lives. For that reason they are better equipped for development and in the long run biologically superior to the Germans.-- quoted by Albert Speer in Inside the Third Reich, Chapter 7: Obersalzberg (years before the start of the war)","Una alianza ser\xe1 tanto m\xe1s fuerte cuanto mayor sea la expectativa de las partes contrayentes por lograr finalidades tangibles y de car\xe1cter expansivo.","While the Goddess of Suffering took me in her arms, often threatening to crush me, my will to resistance grew, and in the end this will was victorious.

Apart from the new artistic trash, which might easily have been produced by a negro tribe, all genuine artistic inspiration came from the German section of the population.","The receptivity of large masses is very limited. Their capacity to understand things is slight whereas their forgetfulness is great. Given this, effective propaganda must restrict itself to a handful of points, which it repeats as slogans as long as it takes for the dumbest member of the audience to get an idea of what they mean.","I make a distinction between the wisdom of age - which can only arise from the greater profundity and foresight that are based on the experiences of a long life - and the creative genius of youth, which blossoms out in thought and ideas with inexhaustible fertility, without being able to put these into practice immediately, because of their very superabundance.","V\xe9ase la preocupaci\xf3n de uno de esos salteadores pol\xedticos en obtener a ruegos el asentimiento de la mayor\xeda para, en cualquier momento, poder alienar la responsabilidad. Pues \xe9sta una de las principales razones por las que esa especie de actividad pol\xedtica es despreciable y odiosa a todo hombre de sentimientos decentes y, por tanto, tambi\xe9n de valor, al tiempo que atrae a todos los caracteres miserables - aquellos que no quieren asumir la responsabilidad de sus acciones, sino que antes procuran huir, no pasando de cobardes villanos.

But not in Germany! For here in Germany we had more than enough time-fifteen years-to acquaint ourselves with these democratic ideals. And we ourselves had to pick up the legacy left behind by this democracy.Now we are being credited with many a truly astounding war aim, especially by the English. After all, England is quite experienced in issuing proclamations of objectives in warfare as it has waged the greatest number of wars the world over.Truly astounding are the war aims announced to us today. A new Europe will arise. This Europe will be characterized by justice. This justice will render armament obsolete. This will lead to disarmament at last. This disarmament in turn will bring about an economic blossoming. Change and trade will spring up-much trade-free trade. And with the sponsorship of this trade, culture shall once more blossom, and not only culture will benefit, but religion will also prosper.In other words: we are heading towards a golden age! Well, we have heard of this golden age before. Many times precisely the same people attempted to illustrate its virtues to us who are now flooding us with descriptions of its benefits. The records are old ones, played once too often. We can only pity these gentlemen who cannot even come up with a new idea to trap a great people. For all this they had already promised us in 1918.Then, too, England\u2019s objectives in the war were the creation of this \u201cnew Europe, the establishment of a \u201cnew justice,\u201d of which the \u201cright to selfdetermination of the peoples\u201d was to form an integral part. Back then already they promised us justice to render obsolete-for all time-the bearing of any sort of weaponry.Back then already they submitted to us a program for disarmament-one for global disarmament. To make this disarmament more evident, it was to be crowned by the establishment of an association of nations bearing no arms.These were to settle their differences in the future-for even back then there was no doubt that differences would still arise-by talking them to death in discussion and debate, just as is the custom in democratic states. There would be no more shooting under any circumstances! In 1918, they declared a blessed and pious age to come! What came to pass in its stead we all lived to see: the old states were destroyed without even as much as asking their citizenry. Historic, ancient structures were severed, not only state bodies but grown economic structures as well, without anything better to take their place. In total disregard of the principle of the right to self-determination of the peoples, the European peoples were hacked to pieces, torn apart. Great states were dissolved.Nations were robbed of their rights, first rendered utterly defenseless and then subjected to a division which left only victors and vanquished in this world.And then there was no more talk of disarmament. To the contrary, armament went on. Nor did any efforts materialize to settle conflicts peacefully. The armed states waged wars just as before. Yet those who had been disarmed were no longer in a position to ward off the aggressions of those well armed.Naturally, this did not herald economic prosperity but, to the contrary, produced a network of lunatic reparations payments which led to increasing destitution for not only the vanquished, but also the so-called victors themselves. The consequences of this economic destitution were felt most acutely by the German Volk.International finance remained brutal and squeezed our Volk ruthlessly.Adolf Hitler \u2013 speech in the Sportpalast Berlin, January 30, 1940\u201d","in the swastika, the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man, and, by the same token, the victory of the idea of creative work.","If at this moment we were to eliminate the religions by force, the people would unanimously beseech us for a new form of worship. You can imagine our Gauleiters giving up their pranks to play at being saints ! As for our Minister for Religion, according to his own co-religionists, God himself would turn away from his family!I envisage the future, therefore, as follows : First of all, to each man his private creed. Superstition shall not lose its rights. The Party is sheltered from the danger of competing with the religions. These latter must simply be forbidden from interfering in future with temporal matters. From the tenderest age, education will be imparted in such a way that each child will know all that is important to the maintenance of the State. As for the men close to me, who, like me, have escaped from the clutches of dogma, I\'ve no reason to fear that the Church will get its hooks on them.We\'ll see to it that the Churches cannot spread abroad teachings in conflict with the interests of the State. We shall continue to preach the doctrine of National Socialism, and the young will no longer be taught anything but the truth.","A state which in this age of racial poisoning dedicates itself to the care of its best racial elements must some day become lord of the earth.

When a man occupies such a position, he should eliminate all his family feeling. Napoleon, on the contrary, placed his brothers and sisters in posts of command, and retained them in these posts even after they\'d given proofs of their incapability. All that was necessary was to throw out all these patently incompetent relatives. Instead of that, he wore himself out with sending his brothers and sisters, regularly every month, letters containing reprimands and warnings, urging them to do this and not to do that, thinking he could remedy their incompetence by promising them money, or by threatening not to give them any more. Such illogical behaviour can be explained only by the feeling Corsicans have for their families, a feeling in which they resemble the Scots. By thus giving expression to his family feeling, Napoleon introduced a disruptive principle into his life. Nepotism, in fact, is the most formidable protection imaginable : the protection of the ego. But wherever it has appeared in the life of a State\u2014the monarchies are the best proof\u2014it has resulted in weakening and decay. Reason : it puts an end to the principle of effort.In this respect, Frederick the Great showed himself superior to Napoleon\u2014Frederick who, at the most difficult moments of his life, and when he had to take the hardest decisions, never forgot that things are called upon to endure. In similar cases, Napoleon capitulated. It\'s therefore obvious that, to bring his life\'s work to a successful conclusion, Frederick the Great could always rely on sturdier collaborators than Napoleon could. When Napoleon set the interests of his family clique above all, Frederick the Great looked around him for men, and, at need, trained them himself.Despite all Napoleon\'s genius, Frederick the Great was the most outstanding man of the eighteenth century. When seeking to find a solution for essential problems concerning the conduct of affairs of State, he refrained from all illogicality. It must be recognised that in this field his father, Frederick-William, that buffalo of a man, had given him a solid and complete training. Peter the Great, too, clearly saw the necessity for eliminating the family spirit from public life. In a letter to his son\u2014a letter I was re-reading recently\u2014he informs him very clearly of his intention to disinherit him and exclude him from the succession to the throne. It would be too lamentable, he writes, to set one day at the head of Russia a son who does not prepare himself for State affairs with the utmost energy, who does not harden his will and strengthen himself physically.Setting the best man at the head of the State\u2014that\'s the most difficult problem in the world to solve.","En oposici\xf3n a ese parlamentarismo democr\xe1tico est\xe1 la genuina democracia germ\xe1nica de la libre elecci\xf3n del F\xfchrer, que se obliga a asumir toda la responsabilidad de sus actos.

The fact is that since I\'ve been in power, I\'ve had only a single idea: to re-arm. That\'s how I was able, last summer, to decide to attack Russia.Confronted with the innumerable populations of the East, we cannot exist except on condition that all Germanics are united. They must compose the nucleus around which Europe will federate. On the day when we\'ve solidly organised Europe, we shall be able to look towards Africa. And, who knows? perhaps one day we shall be able to entertain other ambitions.There are three ways of settling the social question. The privileged class rules the people. The insurgent proletariat exterminates the possessing class. Or else a third formula gives each man the opportunity to develop himself according to his talents. When a man is competent, it matters little to me if he\'s the son of a caretaker. And, by the way, I\'m not stopping the descendants of our military heroes from going once more through the same tests.I wouldn\'t feel I had the right to demand of each man the supreme sacrifice, if I hadn\'t myself gone through the whole 1914-18 war in the front line.Turning towards the Danish guest, the Fuehrer commented:For you, things are easier than they were for us.

The tempest of historical achievementsseemed to have permanently subsided, so much so that the future appeared to be irrevocably delivered over to what was called peaceful competition between the nations. This simply meant a system of mutual exploitation by fraudulent means, the principle of resorting to the use of force in self-defence being formally excluded. Individual countries increasingly assumed the appearance of commercial undertakings, grabbing territory and clients and concessions from each other under any and every kind of pretext. And it was all staged to an accompaniment of loud but innocuous shouting. This trend of affairs seemed destined to develop steadily and permanently. Having the support of public approbation, it seemed bound eventually to transform the world into a mammoth department store. In the vestibule of this emporium there would be rows of monumental busts which would confer immortality on those profiteers who had proved themselves the shrewdest at their trade and those administrative officials who had shown themselves the most innocuous. The salesmen could be represented by the English and the administrative functionaries by the Germans; whereas the Jews would be sacrificed to the unprofitable calling of proprietorship, for they are constantly avowing that they make no profits and are always being called upon to \'pay out\'.

In a letter which we found on Stalin\'s son written by a friend, stands the following phrase : \\"I hope to be able to see my Anuschka once more before the promenade to Berlin.\\"If, in accordance with their plan, the Russians had been able to foresee our actions, it is, probable that nothing would have been able to stop their armoured units, for the highly developed road system of central Europe would greatly have favoured their advance. In any case, I take credit for the fact that we succeeded in making the Russians hold off right up to the moment when we launched our attack, and that we did so by entering into agreements which were favourable to their interests. Suppose for example that, when the Russians marched into Rumania, we had not been able to limit their conquests to Bessarabia, they would in one swoop have grabbed all the oilfields of the country, and we should have found ourselves, from the spring of that very year, completely frustrated as regards our supplies of petrol.","When National Socialism has ruled long enough, it will no longer be possible to conceive of a form of life different from ours.In the long run, National Socialism and religion will no longer be able to exist together.","En aquel tiempo, en mi ingenuidad de joven, cre\xed poder evidenciar los errores de su doctrina.

Rome would have conquered all Europe, and the onrush of the Huns would have been broken on the legions. It was Christianity that brought about the fall of Rome\u2014not the Germans or the Huns.What Bolshevism is achieving to-day on the materialist and technical level, Christianity had achieved on the metaphysical level. When the Crown sees the throne totter, it needs the support of the masses.It would be better to speak of Constantine the traitor and Julian the Loyal than of Gonstantine the Great and Julian the Apostate. What the Christians wrote against the Emperor Julian is approximately of the same calibre as what the Jews have written against us. The writings of the Emperor Julian, on the other hand, are products of the highest wisdom. If humanity took the trouble to study and understand history, the resulting consequences would have incalculable implications. One day ceremonies of thanksgiving will be sung to Fascism and National Socialism for having preserved Europe from a repetition of the triumph of the Underworld.","The end of the war will see the final ruin of the Jew. The Jew is the incarnation of egoism. And their egoism goes so far that they\'re not even capable of risking their lives for the defence of their most vital interests.The Jew totally lacks any interest in things of the spirit. If he has pretended in Germany to have a bent for literature and the arts, that\'s only out of snobbery, or from a liking for speculation. He has no feeling for art, and no sensibility. Except in the regions where they live in groups, the Jews are said to have reached a very high cultural level! Take Nuremberg, for example: for four hundred years\u2014that is to say, until 1838\u2014it hadn\'t a single Jew in its population. Result: a situation in the first rank of German cultural life. Put the Jews all together: by the end of three hundred years, they\'ll have devoured one another. Where we have a philosopher, they have a Talmudistic pettifogger. What for us is an attempt to get to the bottom of things and express the inexpressible, becomes for the Jew a pretext for verbal juggleries. His only talent is for masticating ideas so as to disguise his thought. He has observed that the Aryan is stupid to the point of accepting anything in matters of religion, as soon as the idea of God is recognised. With the Aryan, the belief in the Beyond often takes a quite childish form ; but this belief does represent an effort towards a deepening of things. The man who doesn\'t believe in the Beyond has no understanding of religion. The great trick of Jewry was to insinuate itself fraudulently amongst the religions with a religion like Judaism, which in reality is not a religion. Simply, the Jew has put a religious camouflage over his racial doctrine. Everything he undertakes is built on this lie.The Jew can take the credit for having corrupted the Graeco- Roman world. Previously words were used to express thoughts; he used words to invent the art of disguising thoughts. Lies are his strength, his weapon in the struggle. The Jew is said to be gifted. His only gift is that of juggling with other people\'s property and swindling each and everyone. Suppose I find by chance a picture that I believe to be a Titian. I tell the owner what I think of it, and I offer him a price. In a similar case, the Jew begins by declaring that the picture is valueless, he buys it for a song and sells it at a profit of 5000 per cent. To persuade people that a thing which has value, has none, and vice versa\u2014that\'s not a sign of intelligence. They can\'t even overcome the smallest economic crisis!The Jew has a talent for bringing confusion into the simplest matters, for getting everything muddled up. Thus comes the moment when nobody understands anything more about the question at issue. To tell you something utterly insignificant, the Jew drowns you in a flood of words. You try to analyse what he said, and you realise it\'s all wind. The Jew makes use of words to stultify his neighbours. And that\'s why people make them professors.The law of life is : \\"God helps him who helps himself!\\" It\'s so simple that everybody is convinced of it, and nobody would pay to learn it. But the Jew succeeds in getting himself rewarded for his meaningless glibness. Stop following what he says, for a moment, and at once his whole scaffolding collapses. I\'ve always said, the Jews are the most diabolic creatures in existence, and at the same time the stupidest. They can\'t produce a musician, or a thinker. No art, nothing, less than nothing. They\'re liars, forgers, crooks. They owe their success only to the stupidity of their victims.If the Jew weren\'t kept presentable by the Aryan, he\'d be so dirty he couldn\'t open his eyes. We can live without the Jews, but they couldn\'t live without us. When the Europeans realise that, they\'ll all become simultaneously aware of the solidarity that binds them together. The Jew prevents this solidarity. He owes his livelihood to the fact that this solidarity does not exist.","In the Great Hall of the Linz Library are the busts of Kant, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, the greatest of our thinkers, in comparison with whom the British, the French and the Americans have nothing to offer...It is on the foundation of Kant\'s theory of knowledge that Schopenhauer\u2026conquered the pragmatism of GWF Hegel. I carried Schopenhauer\'s works with me throughout the whole of the First World War. Schopenhauer...has been far surpassed by Nietzsche.","There is no novel of world history, which is more wonderful than our party\u2019s development to its present greatness.Speech of March 20, 1934 in Munich","What could be more natural for me than to look upon the Abbot as representing the highest human ideal worth striving for, just as the position of the humble village priest had appeared to my father in his own boyhood days?","He who does not possess the force to secure his Lebensraum in this world and, if necessary, to enlarge it, does not deserve to possess the necessities of life. He must step aside and allow stronger peoples to pass him by. This was so at all times. The world will not be an empty one because one Volk renounces its life. Rather the Lebensraum will be filled up by other peoples, other beings. There is no vacuum in nature.Speech at the annual rally of young officer cadets at the Berlin Sportpalast December 18, 1940","Just as in Islam, there is no kind of terrorism in the Japanese state religion, but on the contrary a promise of happiness.","We Germans have everything to gain in this struggle for existence, for to lose this war would mean our finish. Asiatic barbarism would flood Europe just as it happened at the time of the Huns or the Mongolians. Nobody knows that better than the German soldier and the nations who are fighting by his side and who have had an opportunity to become acquainted with the meaning of Bolshevist liberation of humanity.England however, will win nothing in this war. It will lose and then perhaps it will gradually begin to realize that the fate of nations and peoples must not be entrusted to the care of a cynical drunkard nor of people who are mentally ill.Truth will be the final victor in this fight. Truth, however, is with us. I\'m proud of the fact that destiny has chosen me to lead the German nation in such a great period. For always I aim to tie my name and my life to its fate. I have no other favor to ask of the Almighty but to let us be victorious in the future as we were in the past and to let me live only as long as he considers necessary to conclude this fight for existence of the German nation for there is no greater glory than the honor to be the leader of one\'s people and thereby the bearer of responsibility in times of stress and nothing could make me feel any happier than the thought that that people is my own, my German people.Adolf Hitler \u2013 speech to the Reichstag, April 26, 1942","And now, my young Comrades, you must understand one thing: in the year 1919, I took up a struggle which appeared nearly hopeless at the time. An unknown man who undertook to rid a world of resistance, to tear down walls of prejudice. Prejudice at times is worse than divine force.A man took a stand against all the bearers of public life back then, against the parties, against their press, against the whole system of capitalist fabrication of public opinion. I led this struggle until the final seizure of power.You must understand one thing: that at this moment I could have only one wish, namely, that if this war is indeed inevitable, that it still be fought during my lifetime, because I am the man who possesses the greatest authority with the German Volk. And moreover, because I believe that based on the experiences of my life, I am the most able to strengthen the nation in this battle and to lead it into this battle. Thus, once I became aware that England was determined to fight this battle, I did not capitulate, but in an instant determined to do everything to prepare Germany to hold its own in this most difficult struggle for its existence. And my appeal to the German nation was not in vain. I labored in these years to build up armament for the German Volk. I subordinated everything to the one thought: how can Germany be made strong? How can its armament be made powerful? I was determined to do nothing by half-measures, but to stake everything on one throw. I knew that this struggle would determine whether Germany will be or will not be.It is not a question of a system. It is a question of whether these 85 million people, in their national unity, can carry through on their right to life or not.If yes, then the future of Europe belongs to this Volk. If no, then this Volk shall perish, shall sink back, and it will no longer be worthwhile to live in this Volk.Faced with this alternative, I was determined to employ all means-down to the last-in this struggle. The nation understood this. Millions of men never spoke of it. Still all thought the same. And throughout this period, nobody ever reproached me for this enormous mobilization of public means for the one goal: national armament. I also wished that, if the hour was to come and come it would, the German soldier should not set out against the enemy as, regrettably, this has been the case far too often in Germany\u2019s past.This phrase, \u201cthe best weapons for the best soldier in the world, has profound meaning. The best soldier must and will despair once it dawns on him that, in spite of his valor, the effectiveness of his arms does not suffice to force the victory. Therefore, I was determined to do my utmost to secure for us the best arms. And, before German history, I may be faulted on many a thing, but on one topic assuredly not: that I had not done my utmost, what was humanly possible, to prepare the German Volk better for this struggle than, regrettably, it was prepared in the year 1914. In this, I found the support of countless people, men of the state, the Party, and in particular the Wehrmacht. They walked by my side. And thus we were able, in barely seven years, to make the German Wehrmacht once more the world\u2019s best. And, for my person, I have always been convinced that for us Germans there are only two possibilities: either we are no soldiers or we are the world\u2019s best. There is no in-between.Adolf Hitler - speech at the annual rally of young officer cadets at the Berlin Sportpalast December 18, 1940\u201d","Great speech to the German ReichstagBerlin, January 30, 1939Once again I will be a prophet: should the international Jewry of finance (Finanzjudentum) succeed, both within and beyond Europe, in plunging mankind into yet another world war, then the result will not be a Bolshevization of the earth and the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation (Vernichtung) of the Jewish race in Europe. Thus, the days of propagandist impotence of the non-Jewish peoples are over.National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy possess institutions which, if necessary, permit opening the eyes of the world to the true nature of this problem.Many a people is instinctively aware of this, albeit not scientifically versed in it.At this moment, the Jews are still propagating their campaign of hatred in certain states under the cover of press, film, radio, theater, and literature, which are all in their hands. Should indeed this one Volk attain its goal of prodding masses of millions from other peoples to enter into a war devoid of all sense for them, and serving the interests of the Jews exclusively, then the effectiveness of an enlightenment will once more display its might. Within Germany, this enlightenment conquered Jewry utterly in the span of a few years.Peoples desire not to perish on the battlefield just so that this rootless, internationalist race can profit financially from this war and thereby gratify its lust for vengeance derived from the Old Testament. The Jewish watchword \u201cProletarians of the world, unite! will be conquered by a far more lofty realization, namely: \u201cCreative men of all nations, recognize your common foe!\u201d","Speech in the Sportpalast Berlin, January 30, 1942They say, \u201cyou sail on your KdF ships; we cannot allow them to land here; that would corrupt our laborers. Now, why would that corrupt their laborers? I cannot see why. The German laborer has worked more than ever before; why should he not have a rest? Is it not a joke when today the man in the White House says, \u201cwe have a program for the world, and this program for the world will give man freedom and the right to work.\u201d Mr. Roosevelt-open your eyes! We have already done this in Germany a long time ago. Or when he says that the sick ought to be taken care of. Please leave the garden of our party program-this is National Socialist teaching and not yours, Sir! This is heresy for a democrat.Or when he says, \u201cwe want laborers to have a vacation.\u201d It is a little late to want this, since we have already put this into practice. And we would be much further along now if Mr. Roosevelt had not interfered. Or when he says, \u201cwe want to increase prosperity for the masses of laborers, too.\u201d All these things are in our program! He might have seen them through, if he had not started the war. After all, we did all this before the war. No, these capitalist hyenas do not have the slightest intention of doing this. They see us as a suspicious example.And now, in order to lure their own people, they have to get in on our party program and fish out a few sentences, these poor bunglers. And even that they do imperfectly.We had a world unanimously against us here. Of course, not only on the right, but also on the left. Those on the left feared: \u201cWhat are we going to do, if this experiment succeeds and he actually makes it and eliminates the housing problem? What if he manages to introduce an educational system based on which a talented boy, no matter who his parents are, can attain God knows what position? And, he is capable of doing it, he is already making a Reich protector out of a former farmhand. What if he really introduces an old-age pension scheme covering the whole Volk? What if he truly secures a right to vacations for the whole Volk, since he is already building ships? And he is bringing all this up to an ordered and secured standard of living. What are we going to do? We live by the absence of this. We live by this and, therefore, we must fight National Socialism.\u201d What the others have accomplished-that, our comrades were best able to see in Russia. We have been in power for nine years now. Bolshevism has been there since 1917, that is, almost twenty-five years. Everyone can judge for himself by comparing this Russia with Germany. The things we did in these nine years. What does the German Volk look like, and what have they accomplished over there? I do not even want to mention the capitalist states.They do not take care of their unemployed, because no American millionaire will ever come into the area where they live, and no unemployed man will ever go to the area where the millionaires live. While hunger marches to Washington and to the White House are organized, they are usually dispersed en route by the police by means of rubber truncheons and tear gas. Such things do not exist in authoritarian Germany. We deal with such problems without such things-rubber truncheons and tear gas.\u201d","So long as there are employers who attack social understanding and have wrong ideas of justice and fair play it is not only the right but also the duty of their employees - who are, after all, an integral part of our people - to protect the general interests against the greed and unreason of the individual.","Speech to the ReichstagApril 26, 1942The British Jew, Lord Disraeli, once said that the race problem is the key to the history of the world. We National Socialists have become great in this knowledge. By devoting our attention to the existence of the race problem, we have found the solution for many problems which would have otherwise have seemed incomprehensible.The hidden forces which incited England already in 1914, in the first world war, were Jews. The force which paralyzed us at that time and finally forced us to surrender with the slogan that Germany was no longer able to bear homeward a victorious flag, came from the Jews. It was the Jews who fomented the revolution among our people and thus robbed us of every possibility at further resistance. Since 1939 the Jews have maneuvered the British Empire into the most perilous crisis it has ever known. The Jews were the carriers of that Bolshevist infection which once threatened to destroy Europe. It was also they who incited the ranks of the plutocracies to war, and it is the Jews who have driven America to war against all her own interests, simply and solely from the Jewish capitalistic point of view. And President Roosevelt, lacking ability himself, lends an ear to his brain trust, whose leading men I do not need to mention by name; they are Jews, nothing but Jews. And once again, as in the year 1915, she (America) will be incited by a Jewish President and his completely Jewish entourage to go to war without any reason or sense whatever, with nations which have never done anything to America, and with people from whom America can never win anything. For what is the sense of a war waged by a state having territory without people against people without territory. In the terms of the war it is no longer a question of the interests of individual nations; it is, rather, a question of conflict between nations which want to make the lives of their people secure on this earth, and nations which have become the helpless tools of an international world parasite.The German soldiers and the allies have had an opportunity to witness at first hand the actual work of this Jewish International-war mongers in that country in which Jewish dictatorship has exclusive power and in which it is being taught as the most ideal form of government in the world for future generations and to which low subjects of other nations have become inexplicably subservient just as this was the case with us at one time.And at this juncture this seemingly senile Europe has, as always in the course of its history, raised aloft the torch of its perception and today the men of Europe are marching as the representatives of a new and better order as the genuine youth of social and national liberty throughout the world.Gentlemen! In the course of this winter a decision has been reached in international struggle which as regards to problems involved far exceeds in scope those difficulties which must and can be solved in normal warfare; when in November 1918 the German nation being befogged by the hypocritical phraseology of the American President at that time, Wilson, laid down its arms, although undefeated, and withdrew from the field of battle it was acting under the influence of that Jewish race which hoped to succeed in establishing a secure bulwark of Bolshevism in the very heart of Europe.We know the theoretical principles and the cruel truth regarding the aims of this world-wide pestilence. It is called, \\"the Rule of the Proletariat,\\" and it really is \\"Jewish Dictatorship,\\" the extermination of national government and of the intelligent element among the nations, and the rule over the proletariat after it has thus deprived of its leaders and through its own fault ended defenseless by the concerted efforts of Jewish international criminals.","It was only natural that the hardships of his youth should enhance his subsequent achievement in his eyes, particularly since it resulted exclusively from his own energy and iron diligence. It was the pride of the self-made man which made him want his son to rise to the same position in life, or, of course, even higher if possible, especially since, by his own industrious life, he thought he would be able to facilitate his child\'s development so greatly.","Il Reich tedesco deve racchiudere tutti i Tedeschi, col compito di estrarre e conservare da questo popolo i pi\xf9 preziosi fra gli elementi originari di razza e condurli ad una posizione di dominio.

After all, Germany was itself so ill at the time, so weakened by the spreading Jewish infection, that it could hardly think of overcoming the Bolshevik danger at home, not to mention abroad. The economic ruin brought about by the Jews as in other countries, the unemployment of millions of Germans, the destruction of peasantry, trade, and industry only prepared the way for the planned internal collapse. This was furthered by support for the continued existence of a senseless state of classes, which could only serve to transform the reason of the masses into hatred in order to make them the willing instrument of the Bolshevik revolution. By mobilizing the proletarian slaves, the Jews hoped that, following the destruction of the national intelligentsia, they could all the more reduce them for good to coolies. But even if this process of the Bolshevik revolt in the interior of Germany had not led to complete success, the state with its democratic Weimar constitution would have been reduced to something ridiculously helpless in view of the great tasks of current world politics. In order to be armed for this confrontation, not only the problems of political power but also the social and economic problems had to be resolved.When National Socialism undertook the realization of its program eleven years ago, it managed just in time to build up a state that did not only have the strength at home but also the power abroad to fulfill the same European mission which first Greece fulfilled in antiquity by opposing the Persians, then Rome [by opposing] the Carthaginians, and the Occident in later centuries by opposing the invasions from the east.Therefore, in the year 1933, we set ourselves four great tasks among many others. On their resolution depended not only the future of the Reich but also the rescue of Europe, perhaps even of the entire human civilization:1. The Reich had to regain the internal social peace that it had lost by resolving the social questions. That meant that the elements of a division into classes bourgeoisie and proletariat-had to be eliminated in their various manifestations and be replaced by a Volksgemeinschaft. The appeal to reason had to be supplemented by the merciless eradication of the base elements of resistance in all camps.2. The social and political unification of the nation had to be supplemented by a national, political one. This meant that the body of the Reich, which was not only politically, but also governmentally divided, had to be replaced by a unified National Socialist state, the construction and leadership of which were suited to oppose and withstand even the heaviest attacks and severest tests of the future.3. The nationally and politically coherent centralized state had the mission of immediately creating a Wehrmacht, whose ideology, moral attitude, numerical strength, and material equipment could serve as an instrument of self-assertion. After the outside world had rejected all German offers for a limitation of armament, the Reich had to fashion its own armament accordingly.4. In order to secure its continued existence in Europe with the prospect of actual success, it was necessary to integrate all those countries which were inhabited by Germans, or were areas which had belonged to the German Reich for over a thousand years and which, in terms of their national substance and economy, were indispensable to the preservation of the Reich, that is, for its political and military defense.Only the resolution of all these tasks could result in the creation of that state which was capable, at home and abroad, of waging the fight for its defense and for the preservation of the European family of nations.","In four years of struggle, this Volk faced off twenty-six states and was only vanquished by betrayal and dishonesty! Had there not been Germans back then to undermine trust in their own regime, England and France would never have won! Had then [in 1918] a certain Adolf Hitler, instead of serving as a German musketeer, been German Reich Chancellor, do you really believe that then the false gods of capitalism and international democracy would have carried the victory?!When I conjure up all these so-called international statesmen in the democracies, who today talk big in Europe, before my mind\u2019s eye and envision their lives\u2019 achievements, then all I can say is: At home and abroad, I have always had the misfortune of fighting against zeroes. These folk rule over the largest of terrains on this earth and yet are not even capable of eliminating unemployment in their own countries. And these folk speak of the necessity of a new order for Europe. That reminds me of the talk of our own democrats of earlier days who preached the necessity of a new order for Germany. This new order was indeed established-although without them. And a new order will be established in the world-although equally without them!

It denies the value of personality in man, disputes the significance of nation and race, and deprives mankind of the essentials of its survival and civilization.

Destruction would be the only result for the inhabitants of this planet.

And this struggle for existence will spur these nations on to the most tremendous accomplishments in world history. If profit is the driving force for production in the democracies-a profit that industrialists, bankers, and corrupt politicians pocket-then the driving force in National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy is the realization by millions of laborers that, in this war, it is they who are being fought against. They realize that the democracies, if they should ever win, would rage with the full capitalist cruelty, that cruelty of which only those are capable whose only god is gold, who know no human sentiments other than their obsession with profit, and who are ready to sacrifice all noble thought to this profit instinct without hesitation.National Socialist Germany, Fascist Italy, and allied Japan know that what is at stake in this war is not a form of government. It is not a question of some type of international structure for the future, but it is a question of whether this world belongs only to certain people and not also to others.An American politician coined the clever saying that, basically, this struggle is nothing other than an attempt by the have-nots to obtain something.That\u2019s all right with us. While the outside world is setting about to steal from the have-nots the little that they possess, we confront the world of ownership with the decision to fight for the human rights of the have-nots and to secure for them that share in life to which these rights entitle them.This struggle is not an attack on the rights of other nations, but on the arrogance and avarice of a narrow capitalist upper class, one which refuses to acknowledge that the days are over when gold ruled the world, and that, by contrast, a future is dawning when the people will be the determining force in the life of a nation.It was this realization that lent wings to the National Socialist armies last year. And it will also help them triumph in the coming year. By fighting for the happiness of all people, we believe we most deserve the blessings of Providence. Until now, the Lord God has approved our struggle.

Never in my life have I imposed on anyone. Whoever does not want to speak to me does not have to. I don\u2019t care! We are eighty-five million Germans, and these Germans do not need that; they have a mighty historic past. They already had an empire when England was only a small island. And that for more than three hundred years.For England these colonies are useless. It has forty million square kilometers [this forty-million figure consists mostly of the colonies]. What is it doing with them? Nothing at all. It is the avarice of old usurers, who do not want to give away what they possess. They are sick creatures. If they see that their neighbor has nothing to eat, they would still rather throw what they possess into the sea than give it away, even if they cannot use it themselves.They get ill at the thought that they could lose something. And I did not even ask for anything that belonged to the English. I asked only for what they robbed us of and stole from us in the years 1918 and 1919! Robbery and theft contrary to the solemn assurances of the American president Wilson! We did not ask anything of them, we did not make any demands. Again and again, I stretched my hand out to them, and, still, everything was in vain. The reasons are clear to us: for one, it is German unification as such. They hate this, our state, irrespective of what it looks like, whether it is imperial or National Socialist, democratic or authoritarian. That makes no difference to them. And second: above all, they hate the rise of this Reich.And here lust for power abroad and base egoism at home join forces. When they say, \u201cWe can never come to an understanding with this world, then this world is the world of the awakening social conscience, with which they cannot come to an understanding. I can make only one response to these gentlemen on both sides of the ocean: the socialist world will be the victorious one in the end! The social conscience of all people will be roused. They can wage wars for their capitalist interests, but these wars themselves will ultimately pave the way for social upheaval among their people.It is not possible in the long run to gear hundreds of millions of people to the interests of a few individuals. The common interest of mankind will gain the victory over the interests of these small, plutocratic profiteers! Just a short while ago, they conclusively proved to us that our officers and generals are worthless because they are young and infected with National Socialist thinking, that is, they have some contact with the broad masses. Now events have shown where the better generals are, over there or here! If this war lasts any longer, then this will be a great misfortune for England.They will get to see real action. And, one day, perhaps the English will send a commission over here in order to adopt our platform!National Socialism will determine the coming millennia in German history, which would be unthinkable without it.

Bolshevism practises a lie of the same nature, when it claims tobring liberty to men, whereas in reality it seeks only to enslavethem. In the ancient world, the relations between men andgods were founded on an instinctive respect. It was a world enlightenedby the idea of tolerance. Christianity was the firstcreed in the world to exterminate its adversaries in the name oflove. Its key-note is intolerance.Without Christianity, we should not have had Islam. The Roman Empire, under Germanic influence, would have developed in the direction of world-domination, and humanity would not have extinguished fifteen centuries of civilisation at a single stroke.Let it not be said that Christianity brought man the life of the soul, for that evolution was in the natural order of things.The result of the collapse of the Roman Empire was a night that lasted for centuries.","The religions have passed the climacteric; they\'re now decadent.

And, finally, this year will help to secure the foundations for true international understanding and thus for a reconciliation of nations.I would not like to forget to repeat the advice that I gave before the German Reichstag on January 30, 1939: namely, the advice that should the outside world allow itself to be plunged into a general war by Jewry, then all of Jewry will be finished in Europe! They may still laugh about this today, just as they earlier laughed about my prophesies. The coming months and years will show that I have foreseen things correctly this time also. Now already, our racial idea takes hold of one people after another. And I hope that those who are at enmity with us today will one day recognize their internal enemies and form one front with us: a front against international Jewish exploitation and corruption of people! The year that lies behind us as of January 30 was a year of great successes, but also of great sacrifices. Even if the total number of dead and wounded is small in comparison with those of former wars, the sacrifice is difficult for all those who are individually concerned. Our affection, our love, and our solicitude belong to those who had to make these sacrifices. They suffered what generations before us suffered in terms of sacrifice, but every German made his sacrifice. The nation worked in all spheres, and, above all, the German woman worked to replace the man! It is the wonderful idea of the community that rules our Volk! That this idea may be preserved in its full force will be our wish today! That we may work for this community will be our pledge! That we may gain the victory in the service of this community will be our faith and our confidence! And that the Lord God may not abandon us in this struggle in the coming year will be our prayer!Deutschland - Sieg Heil!Speech in the Sportpalast Berlin, January 30, 1941","excuse for our negligent attitude. But it is not so. What we call chauvinistic education - in the case of the French people, for example - is only the excessive exaltation of the greatness of France in all spheres of culture or, as the French say, civilization.

Wherever the importance of the political and cultural greatness of his country is concerned he is taught in the most subjective way that one can imagine.","Speech to the Reichstag Berlin, December 11Deputies! Men of the German Reichstag! Ever since the rejection of my last peace proposal in July 1940, we have been aware that this war has to be fought to the bitter end. That the Anglo-American, Jewish-capitalist world formed a front with Bolshevism does not come as a surprise to us National Socialists. At home, we found them in the same union, and we succeeded in our struggle at home by defeating our enemies after a sixteen-year-long struggle for power.When I decided twenty-three years ago to enter politics in order to reverse the decline of the nation, I was a nameless, unknown soldier. Many of you know how difficult the first years of this struggle were. The way from a small movement of seven men to the taking over of responsible government on January 30, 1933, was so miraculous that Providence itself must have made it possible through its blessings.Today, I head the strongest army in the world, the mightiest air force, and a proud navy. Behind me, I am conscious of the sworn community of the party, which made me great and which became great through me.The enemies that I confront have been known to be our enemies for over twenty years. Alas, the road that lies ahead of me cannot be compared to the one lying behind me. The German Volk realizes the decisiveness of the hour for its existence. Under the most difficult circumstances, millions of soldiers are obediently and loyally doing their duty.The American President and his plutocratic clique have called us a people of have nots. That is right! And these have-nots want to live. In any event, they will not allow the owners to rob them of the little that they have to live on. My party comrades, you know my relentless resolve to conclude a struggle victoriously once it has begun. You know my intention not to shy away from anything in such a fight and to break all the resistance that has to be broken.In my speech on September 1, 1939, I assured you that, in this struggle, neither the force of arms nor time will defeat Germany. I want to assure my enemies that neither will the force of arms nor time defeat us, but neither inner doubts make us falter in the fulfillment of our duty. When we consider the sacrifices of our soldiers, how they risk their lives, then the sacrifices of the homeland become completely insignificant and unimportant. When we think of the numbers of those who, generations before us, fell for the existence and greatness of the German Volk, then we become all the more aware of the greatness of the duty imposed on us.Whoever seeks to forsake this duty has no right to expect treatment as a Volksgenosse in our midst.Therefore, no one can expect to live who thinks that he can depreciate the front\u2019s sacrifices at home. Irrespective of the form of disguise for this attempt to disrupt this German front, to undermine this Volk\u2019s willingness to resist, to weaken the authority of this regime, to sabotage the efforts of the homeland, the offender will fall! There will be only one difference: the soldier honorably makes this sacrifice at the front, while the other, who wishes to depreciate this honorable sacrifice, dies in shame.Our enemies should not deceive themselves. In the two thousand years of the history known to us, our German Volk has never been more unified and united than it is today. The Lord of the Worlds has done so many great things for us in the last years that we bow in gratitude before Providence, which has permitted us to be members of such a great Volk. We thank Him that, in view of past and future generations of the German Volk, we were also allowed to enter our names honorably in the undying book of German history.","First, I became a nationalist.","After all, who are they - these egoists! Every single one of them stands up only for the interests of his class. Behind all of them stands either a Jew or their own moneybag. They are nothing other than profiteers; they live from the profits of this war; no good will follow it. I confront these folk as nothing other than the simple fighter for my German Volk that I am. And I am convinced that, just as this struggle has been blessed by Providence up to now, so it will also be blessed in the future. When I stepped before you in this hall for the first time, twenty-one years ago, I was unknown, nameless, and I had nothing other than my own faith.In these twenty-one years, a new world was created! The way from the present to the future will be easier than the one from February 24, 1920, leading to this day and to this place. With zealous confidence I look to the future.

As we know today, it was the intention of the rulers in the Kremlin to destroy not only Germany, but also Europe. Comrades, you have realized two things in the meantime:1. This opponent armed himself militarily for his attack to such an enormous extent that even our greatest fears were surpassed.2. Lord have mercy on our Volk and on the entire European world if this barbaric enemy had been able to get his tens of thousands of tanks to move before we could. All of Europe would have been lost. For this enemy does not consist of soldiers, but, for the most part, of beasts (Bestien).Now, my comrades, you have personally seen this paradise of workers and peasants\u201d with your own eyes. In a country, whose vastness and fertility could feed the whole world, a poverty reigns that we Germans cannot imagine. This is the result of nearly twenty-five years of Jewish rule which, as Bolshevism, basically reflects the basest form of capitalism. The bearers of this system are the same in both instances: Jews and again Jews! Soldiers! When I called on you to ward off the danger threatening our homeland on June 22, you faced the greatest military power of all time. In barely three months, thanks to your bravery, my comrades, it has been possible to destroy one tank brigade after another belonging to this opponent, to eliminate countless divisions, to take uncounted prisoners, to occupy endless space. And this space is not empty, it is a space in which this opponent lives and from which his gigantic war industry receives raw materials of all types. In a few weeks, three of his most vital industrial districts will be completely in your hands! Your names, soldiers of the German Wehrmacht, and the names of our brave allies, the names of your divisions, regiments, your ships and squadrons, will be tied for all time to the mightiest victories in world history.Proclamation to the soldiers of the Eastern Front Fuhrer Headquarters, October 2, 1941\u201d","It is really unjust to the Vienna governmental circles to reproach them with having instigated a war which might have been prevented.

But it had always been the misfortune of German as well as Austrian diplomats that they endeavoured to put off the inevitable day of reckoning, with the result that they were finally compelled to deliver their blow at a most inopportune moment.","\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u061b \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0622\u0646 \u0647\u0627 \u0628\u062c\u0646\u06af\u062f.","Sosyal Demokrasinin gizli amac\u0131, ancak Yahudilerin ne olduklar\u0131n\u0131 bilmekle anla\u015f\u0131l\u0131r.

In spite of this, a concern weighed heavily on me. It was clear to me that, ultimately, behind this war was that incendiary who has always lived off the quarrels of nations: the international Jew. I would no longer have been a National Socialist had I ever distanced myself from this realization.We followed his traces over many years. In this Reich, probably for the first time, we scientifically resolved this problem for all time, according to plan, and really understood the words of a great Jew who said that the racial question was the key to world history. Therefore, we knew quite well-above all, I knew-that the driving force behind these occurrences was the Jew. And that, as always in history, there were blockheads ready to stand up for him: partly spineless, paid characters, partly people who want to make deals and, at no time, flinch from having blood spilled for these deals. I have come to know these Jews as the incendiaries of the world.After all, in the previous years, you saw how they slowly poisoned the people via the press, radio, film, and theater. You saw how this poisoning continued. You saw how their finances, their money transactions, had to work in this sense. And, in the first days of the war, certain Englishmen-all of them shareholders in the armament industry-said it openly: \u201cThe war must last three years at least. It will not and must not end before three years.-That is what they said. That was only natural, since their capital was tied up and they could not hope to secure an amortization in less than three years. Certainly, my party comrades, for us National Socialists, this almost defies comprehension.But that is how things are in the democratic world. You can be prime minister or minister of war and, at the same time, own portfolios of countless shares in the armament industry. Interests are explained that way.We once came to know this danger as the driving force in our domestic struggle. We had this black-red-golden coalition in front of us; this mixture of hypocrisy and abuse of religion on the one hand, and financial interests on the other; and, finally, their truly Jewish-Marxist goals. We completely finished off this coalition at home in a hard struggle. Now, we stand facing this enemy abroad. He inspired this international coalition against the German Volk and the German Reich.First, he used Poland as a dummy, and later pressed France, Belgium, Holland, and Norway to serve him. From the start, England was a driving force here. Understandably, the power which would one day confront us is most clearly ruled by this Jewish spirit: the Soviet Union. It happens to be the greatest servant of Jewry.Time meanwhile has proved what we National Socialists maintained for many years: it is truly a state in which the whole national intelligentsia has been slaughtered, and where only spiritless, forcibly proletarianized subhumans remain. Above them, there is the gigantic organization of the Jewish commissars, that is, established slaveowners. Frequently people wondered whether, in the long run, nationalist tendencies would not be victorious there.But they completely forgot that the bearers of a conscious nationalist view no longer existed. That, in the end, the man who temporarily became the ruler of this state, is nothing other than an instrument in the hands of this almighty Jewry. If Stalin is on stage and steps in front of the curtain, then Kaganovich and all those Jews stand behind him, Jews who, in ten-thousandfold ramifications, control this mighty empire.Speech in the L\xf6wenbr\xe4ukeller Munich, November 8, 1941\u201d","Il testamento politico della Nazione tedesca deve suonare cos\xec: fate in modo che la forza del nostro popolo abbia la sua base non in colonie ma nel territorio della nostra Patria in Europa.

There was nothing that they did not drag in the mud.","The German Volk will believe me when I say that I would have chosen peace over war. Because for me, peace meant a multitude of delightful assignments. What I was able to do for the German Volk in the few years from 1933 to 1939, thanks to Providence and the support of numerous excellent assistants, in terms of culture, education, as well as economic recovery, and, above all, in the social organization of our lives, this can surely one day be compared with what my enemies have done and achieved in the same period.In the long years of struggle for power, I often regretted that the realization of my plans was spoiled by incidents that were not only relatively unimportant, but also, above all, completely insignificant. I regret this war not only because of the sacrifices that it demands of my German Volk and of other people, but also because of the time it takes away from those who intend to carry out a great social and civilizing work and who want to complete it. After all, what Mr. Roosevelt is capable of achieving, he has proved. What Mr. Churchill has achieved, nobody knows. I can only feel profound regret at what this war will prevent me and the entire National Socialist movement from doing for many years. It is a shame that a person cannot do anything about true bunglers and lazy fellows stealing the valuable time that he wanted to dedicate to cultural, social, and economic projects for his Volk.The same applies to Fascist Italy. There, too, one man has perpetuated his name for all time through a civilizing and national revolution of worldwide dimensions. In the same way it cannot be compared to the democratic-political bungling of the idlers and dividend profiteers, who, in the Anglo-American countries, for instance, spend the wealth accumulated by their fathers or acquire new wealth through shady deals. It is precisely because this young Europe is involved in the resolution of truly great questions that it will not allow the representatives of a group of powers who tactfully call themselves the \u201chave states to rob them of everything that makes life worth living, namely, the value of one\u2019s own people, their freedom, and their social and general human existence. Therefore, we understand that Japan, weary of the everlasting blackmail and impudent threats, has chosen to defend itself against the most infamous warmongers of all time. Now a mighty front of nation-states, reaching from the Channel to East Asia, has taken up the struggle against the international Jewish-capitalist and Bolshevik conspiracy.New Year\u2019s Proclamation to the National Socialists and Party Comrades January 1, 1942\u201d","Il lavoratore deve sapere che il fiorire dell\'economia nazionale significa la sua personale fortuna.

In countless battles in the year 1941, you not only removed from the Finnish, German, Slovak, Hungarian, and Romanian borders the enemy who was ready to launch an attack, but you also drove him back over a thousand kilometers into his own land. In attempting to bring about a turn of events in the winter of 1941\u20131942 and to move against us once more, he must and will fail! Yes, on the contrary, in the year 1942, after all the preparations that have been made, we will engage this enemy of mankind anew and do battle with him for as long as it takes to break the destructive will of the Jewish-capitalist and Bolshevik world. Germany will not and cannot be dragged into a new war for its existence or nonexistence by the same criminals every twenty-five years! Europe cannot and will not tear itself to pieces forever, just so that a bunch of Anglo American and Jewish conspirators can find satisfaction for their business machinations in the dissatisfaction of the people.It is our hope that the blood that is spilled in this war will be the last in Europe for generations. May the Lord help us with this in the coming year!Address to the Wehrmacht: January 1, 1942","We are fully aware that this war can end either in the extermination of the Aryan people or in the disappearance of Jewry from Europe. I said as much before the German Reichstag on January 30, 1939. I wish to avoid making hasty prophesies, but this war will not end as the Jews imagine, namely, in the extermination of the European-Aryan people; instead, the result of this war will be the annihilation of Jewry. For the first time, the old, truly Jewish rule of \u201can eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, will obtain.And the more the fighting expands, the more anti-Semitism will spread- let that be said to world Jewry. Anti-Semitism will be fed in every prisoner-ofwar camp, in every family enlightened to the reason why, in the end, it has to make this sacrifice. And the hour will come when the most evil enemy of the world of all time will at least be finished with for the next millennium.Speech in the Sportpalast Berlin, January 30, 1942\u201d","\xc8 pi\xf9 facile ingannare le masse con una fandonia esagerata che con una piccola bugia.","The parliamentary institution attracts people of the badger type, who do not like the open light. No upright man, who is ready to accept personal responsibility for his acts, will be attracted to such an institution.","What are we taking away from England, what from France, what from America? Nothing at all! How many times did I offer them peace?! What else should I be offering them? They are men who say, like Churchill, \u201cI want war. With them, there is a certain clique. And behind these corrupt, drunk creatures, there are the paying forces of international Jewry. On the other side, there is an old Freemason who believes that through a war he can win time for stabilizing his bankrupt economy again. And so, both states again confront the same enemies for the very same reasons. And they are forced to fight together, to lead the same struggle, which ties them in life and in death.And there is a fourth element: in both cases, there are two men who come from the people, who have kindled the revolutions and have uplifted their states. In the few free hours I have had these last weeks, I read a lot about the Fascist revolution in Italy. It seemed to me as though I had before me the history of my own party: everything so similar, so much the same. The same struggle, the same enemies, the same opponents, the same arguments-it really is a miracle. And now, we fight in the same theaters of war: Germans in Africa, Italians in the east. We fight together, and nobody should deceive himself: This struggle will be seen through to our joint victory! And finally, a third state joined us. For many years, I have wanted to have good relations with this state-Japan-as you know from Mein Kampf.And so, the three great have-nots are now united. We will see who will be stronger in this struggle: those who have nothing to lose and everything to win, or those who have everything to lose and who cannot win anything. What does England want to win? What does America want to win? They have so much that they do not know what to do with all they own. They need to feed only a few people per square kilometer. They do not have all those worries that trouble us. For us, a single bad harvest is a national disaster. They have the whole world at their disposal. For decades now, they have robbed us, exploited us, bled us white, and still they have not eliminated their own economic misery. They have more raw materials than they could possibly need, and still they have not managed to find a reasonable solution to their problems. We will see on whom Providence will bestow the victor\u2019s laurels in this struggle: on the man who has everything and wants to take even the last bit from the man who has almost nothing, or on the man, who defends the last bit he owns. And when a British archbishop prays to the Lord that He might strike Germany and Europe with Bolshevism as a punishment-then I can only say, it will not come to Germany. But whether or not He will strike England, that is another question.Speech in the Sportpalast Berlin, January 30, 1942\u201d","As I critically reviewed the activities of the Jewish people throughout long periods of history I became anxious and asked myself whether for some inscrutable reasons beyond the comprehension of poor mortals such as ourselves, Destiny may not have irrevocably decreed that the final victory must go to this small nation? May it not be that this people which has lived only for the earth has been promised the earth as a recompense? is our right to struggle for our own self-preservation based on reality, or is it a merely subjective thing?  Fate answered the question for me inasmuch as it led me to make a detached and exhaustive inquiry into the Marxist teaching and the activities of the Jewish people in connection with it. The Jewish doctrine of Marxism rejects the aristocratic principle of Nature and replaces the eternal privilege of power and strength with the mass of numbers and their dead weight. Thus it denies personal worth, contests the significance of folk and race, and thereby withdraws from mankind premise for its existence and culture.","\u0625\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0642\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0623\u064a\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u064a \u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0648\u0646\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0625\u062d\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u0648\u0637\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0645","\u0625\u0646 \u0641\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0631\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u064a \u0639\u0644\u064a \u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0647\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628 \u0648\u062d\u0635\u0631\u0647 \u0628\u062e\u0635\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f.","In this world everything that is not of sound racial stock is like chaff.Every historical event in the world is nothing more nor less than a manifestation of the instinct of racial self-preservation, whether for weal or woe.","The man who invented bomb warfare against an innocent civilian population declared that this bomb warfare against Germany and so on will shortly be greatly stepped up. I would like to add one thing to this: in May 1940, Mr. Churchill sent the first bombers against the German civilian population. At the time, I kept warning him, for almost four months-in vain. Then, we struck. And we struck so thoroughly that he began to cry and declared that this was barbaric and terrible, and that England would seek revenge. The man on whose conscience all this weighs-not counting the great warmonger Roosevelt-and who is to blame for everything, this man then dared to claim that he was innocent.Today, he continues to wage this war.I would like to say here: the hour will also come this time when we have to answer! May the two great criminals of this war and their Jewish masterminds not start whining and weeping if the end is more terrible for England than the beginning! At the Reichstag session of September 1, 1939, I said two things: First, since this war was forced on us, neither the power of arms nor time will defeat us. Second, should Jewry instigate an international world war in order to exterminate the Aryan people of Europe, then not the Aryan people will be exterminated, but the Jews. The wire pullers of this insane man in the White House have managed to pull one nation after another into this war.Correspondingly, however, a wave of anti-Semitism swept over one nation after another. And it will continue to do so, taking hold of one state after another. Every state that enters this war will one day emerge from it as an anti- Semitic state. The Jews once laughed about my prophecies in Germany. I do not know whether they are still laughing today or whether they no longer feel like laughing. Today, too, I can assure you of one thing: they will soon not feel like laughing anymore anywhere. My prophecies will prove correct here, too.","El objetivo por el cual tenemos que luchar es el de asegurar la existencia y el incremento de nuestra raza y de nuestro pueblo; el sustento de sus hijos y la conservaci\xf3n de la pureza de su sangre; la libertad y la independencia de la patria, para que nuestro pueblo pueda llegar a cumplir la misi\xf3n que el Supremo Creador le tiene reservada.","There are no more privileges by birth certificate, none by former positions in life, none by so-called origin, none by so-called education in former times.There is only one criterion: the criterion of the brave, valiant, loyal man, the determined fighter, the daring man who is fit to be a leader of his Volk. Truly, the collapse of an old world has been brought about. From this war arises a blood-fortified Volksgemeinschaft, a stronger one than that we National Socialists were able to convey to the nation after the World War through our avowal of faith. And this will perhaps be the greatest blessing for our Volk in the future: that we will emerge from this war improved in our community, cleansed of many prejudices, that this war will prove all the more how correct the party program of our movement was, how correct our whole National Socialist attitude is. For there is one thing which is certain: no bourgeois state will survive this war.Sooner or later, everybody has to put his cards on the table here. Only he who manages to forge his people into a unity not only as a state but also as a society will emerge as the victor from this war. That we National Socialists laid the foundations a long time ago, we and I owe to our experiences in the first war. That the Greater German Reich must now fight a second war-to this our movement will owe the reinforcement and additional depth of its program in the future. May all those be assured of this who perhaps still believe that maybe one day they will be able to witness the new rosy dawn of their class world through empty talk and faultfinding. These gentlemen will pitifully suffer shipwreck. World history will push them aside, as though they had never existed.Returning from the Great War as a soldier, I once explained this Weltanschauung to the German Volk and created the foundations for the party.Do you believe that any German could offer the soldiers, who today are coming home victorious from the war, anything less than a National Socialist Germany-in the sense of the true fulfillment of our ideas of a true Volksgemeinschaft? That is impossible! And this will surely be the most beneficial blessing of this war in the future.Speech in the Sportpalast Berlin, September 30, 1942","Should the ruling hand show signs of weakness in such a State the result will not be to cause a kind of hibernation of the State but rather to awaken the individualist instincts which are slumbering in the ethnological groups. These instincts do not make themselves felt as long as these groups are dominated by a strong central will-to-govern. The danger which exists in these slumbering separatist instincts can be rendered more or less innocuous only through centuries of common education, common traditions and common interests.","How necessary it is to keep realizing that idealism does not represent a superfluous expression of emotion, but that in truth it has been, is, and will be, the premise for what we designate as human culture, yes, that it alone created the concept of \'man\' It is to this inner attitude that the Aryan owes his position in this world, and to it the world owes man; for it alone formed from pure spirit the creative force which, by a unique pairing of the brutal fist and the intellectual genius, created the monuments of human culture.Without his idealistic attitude all, even the most dazzling faculties of the intellect, would remain mere intellect as suchoutward appearance without inner value, and never creative force.But, since true idealism is nothing but the subordination of the interests and life of the individual to the community, and this in turn is the precondition for the creation of organizational forms of all kinds, it corresponds in its innermost depths to the ultimate will of Nature. It alone leads men to voluntary recognition of the privilege of force and strength, and thus makes them into a dust particle of that order which shapes and forms the whole universe.The purest idealism is unconsciously equivalent to the deepest knowledge.","A revolution has three main objectives. First of all, it\'s a matter of breaking down the partitions between classes, so as to enable every man to rise. Secondly, it\'s a matter of creating a standard of living such that the poorest will be assured of a decent existence. Finally, it\'s a matter of acting in such a way that the benefits of civilisation become common property.The people who call themselves democrats blame us for our social policy as if it were a kind of disloyalty: according to them, it imperils the privileges of the owning classes. They regard it as an attack on liberty; for liberty, in their view, is the right of those who have power to continue to exercise it. I understand their reaction very well\u2014but we had no choice. National Socialism is a purely German phenomenon, and we never intended to revolutionise the world. It was enough for us to be given a free hand in Russia and to be offered a few colonies. And the English could still be leading their comfortable little existence. It\'s obvious that, in the long run, they couldn\'t have avoided certain social reforms. One can\'t, in fact, bridge the gap that exists between rich and poor merely with the consolations of religion. I realise, for my own part, that if I were offered the choice between nakedness on this earth (with the compensation of supreme happiness in the world beyond) and an earthly paradise, I certainly wouldn\'t choose to sing Hallelujahs until the end of time.","It would always be disagreeable for me to go down to posterity as a man who made concessions in this field. I realise that man, in his imperfection, can commit innumerable errors\u2014 but to devote myself deliberately to error, that is something I cannot do. I shall never come personally to terms with the Christian lie. In acting as I do, I\'m very far from the wish to scandalise. But I rebel when I see the very idea of Providence flouted in this fashion.It\'s a great satisfaction for me to feel myself totally foreign to that world. But I shall feel I\'m in my proper place if, after my death, I find myself, together with people like me, on some sort of Olympus. I shall be in the company of the most enlightened spirits of all times.","If I try to gauge my work, I must consider, first of all, that I\'ve contributed, in a world that had forgotten the notion, to the triumph of the idea of the primacy of race. Secondly, I\'ve given German supremacy a solid cultural foundation. In fact, the power we to-day enjoy cannot be justified, in my eyes, except by the establishment and expasion of a mighty culture. To achieve this must be the law of our existence. The means I shall set in operation to this end will far surpass those that were necessary for the conduct of this war. I wish to be a builder. A war-leader is what I am against my own will.","The conspiracy of international capitalism and Bolshevism is not an absurd phenomenon but a natural condition. The driving force in both cases is that race whose hatred has torn mankind to pieces time and again throughout the millennia, corrupted it inside, exploited it economically, and destroyed it politically. International Jewry is \u201cthe ferment of the decomposition of people and states today as in antiquity. Things will remain this way, unless the people find the strength to rid themselves of this germ.Proclamation for the 10th anniversary of the Power Taking January 30, 1943\u201d","the general run of politicians will always eschew those schemes for the future which are really difficult to put into practice; and they will practise this avoidance so that they may not lose the immediate favour of the mob. The importance and the success of such politicians belong exclusively to the present and will be of no consequence for the future. But that does not worry small-minded people; they are quite content with momentary results.","I shall give a propagandist reason for starting the war - never mind whether it is plausible or not. The victor will not be asked afterward whether he told the truth or not. Instarting and waging a war it is not right that matters, but victory . . . Eighty million people must obtain what is their right . . . The stronger man is right . . . Whoever has pondered over this world order knows that its meaning lies in the success of the best by means of force . . .","Year after year, they are joined by a new age group from Germany\u2019s youth, totally educated in accordance with National Socialist principles, forged together by the ideas of our Volksgemeinschaft, and willing to move against anyone who should dare to sin against our fight for freedom. And just as in the time of the party\u2019s struggle for power, our female party comrades, our German women and girls, were the most reliable supports of the movement, so now again the multitude of our women and girls form the strongest element in the struggle for the preservation of our Volk.After all, thank God, not only the Jews in London and New York but also those in Moscow made clear what fate might be in store for the German Volk.We are determined to be no less clear in our answer. This fight will not end with the planned annihilation of the Aryan but with the extermination of the Jew in Europe. Beyond this, thanks to this fight, our movement\u2019s world of thought will become the common heritage of all people, even of our enemies.State after state will be forced, in the course of its fight against us, to apply National Socialist theories in waging this war that was provoked by them. And in so doing, it will become aware of the curse that the criminal work of Jewry has laid over all people, especially through this war.As our enemies thought in 1923 that the National Socialist Party was defeated for good and that I was finished with in the eyes of the German Volk because of my trial, so they actually helped National Socialist ideology to spread like wildfire through the entire German Volk and convey the essence of Jewry to so many million men, as we ourselves would never have been able to do under normal circumstances. In the same manner international Jewry, which instigated this new war, will find out that nation after nation engrosses itself more and more in this question to become finally aware of the great danger presented by this international problem.Above all, this war proves the irrefutable identity of plutocracy and Bolshevism, and the common ambition of all Jews to exploit nations and make them the slaves of their international guild of criminals.The same alliance we once faced as our common enemies in Germany, an alliance between the stock exchange in Frankfurt and the \u201cRed Flag in Berlin, now again exists between the Jewish banking houses in New York, the Jewishplutocratic class of leaders in London, and the Jews in the Kremlin in Moscow.Just as the German Volk successfully fought the Jewish enemy at home as a consequence of this realization and is now about to finish it off for good, the other nations will increasingly find themselves again in the course of this war.Together, they will make a stand against that race that is seeking to destroy all of them.Proclamation for the 23th anniversary of the N.S.D.A.P. (read by Hermann Esser) Fuhrer Headquarters, February 24, 1943\u201d","When the rest of the world was engaged in seizing the open spaces, Germany was in the throes of religious warfare.The foundation of St. Petersburg by Peter the Great was a fatal event in the history of Europe; and St. Petersburg must therefore disappear utterly from the earth\'s surface. Moscow, too. Then the Russians will retire into Siberia.It is not by taking over the miserable Russian hovels that we shall establish ourselves as masters in the East. The German colonies must be organised on an altogether higher plane. We have never before driven forward into empty spaces. The German people have absorbed both northern and southern Austria, and the original inhabitants are still there; but they were Sorb-Wends, members of basic European stock, with nothing in common with the Slavs.As for the ridiculous hundred million Slavs, we will mould the best of them to the shape that suits us, and we will isolate the rest of them in their own pig-styes; and anyone who talks about cherishing the local inhabitant and civilising him, goes straight off into a concentration camp !","Ero uno che a scuola imparava presto e bene ma che per il resto era assai riottoso... il genitore non sapeva apprezzare il talento oratorio del suo litigioso rampollo, e men che meno ne traeva conclusioni favorevoli circa il suo avvenire, neppure riusciva a comprendere quest\'alto suo ideale giovanile. Molto preoccupato, egli osservava tale contrasto della natura del figliolo","As a contrast to this kind of democracy we have the German democracy, which is a true democracy; for here the leader is freely chosen and is obliged to accept full responsibility for all his actions and omissions. The problems to be dealt with are not put to the vote of the majority; but they are decided upon by the individual, and as a guarantee of responsibility for those decisions he pledges all he has in the world and even his life.","Had it not been for the mud and rain last October, we should have been in Moscow in no time. We have now learnt that the moment the rain comes, we must stop everything.When the war ends, the German people need not bother its head about what it is going to do during the next fifty years !We shall become the most self-supporting State, in every respect, including cotton, in the world. The only thing we shall not have will be a coffee plantation\u2014but we\'ll find a coffeegrowing colony somewhere or other! Timber we shall have in abundance, iron in limitless quantity, the greatest manganeseore mines in the world, oil\u2014we shall swim in it! And to handle it all, the whole strength of the entire German man power! By God ! how right the peasant is to put his trust solely in the earth ! What\'s the use of talking about scenic beauty, when the earth is oozing with wealth ! In the future, it will be a pleasure to work !Stalin is half beast, half giant. To the social side of life he is utterly indifferent. The people can rot, for all he cares. If we had given him another ten years, Europe would have been swept away, as it was at the time of the Huns. Without the German Wehrmacht, it would have been all up with Europe even now. The doors of the Continent would have been flung open for him by the idiocy of the masses.The worst of our winters is now behind us. In a hundred years\' time there will be millions of German peasants living here.","Mientras el trato asocial e indigno dado al hombre provoque resistencias, y mientras no se hayan instituido autoridades judiciales encargadas de reparar los da\xf1os, siempre \xe9l m\xe1s fuerte vencer\xe1 en la lucha. Por","How little man thinks of the possibility of death during his life is a noteworthy fact. And how little he arranges the details of his life in accordance with the experiences that innumerable men before him had to have and which, as such, are all known to him. There are always exceptions who bear this in mind and who, by virtue of their personality, try to force on their fellow men the laws of life that lay at the base of the experiences of past epochs. Hence it is noteworthy that innumerable hygienic measures which perforce redound to the advantage of a Folk, and which individually are uncomfortable, must be formally forced upon the main body of a Folk through the autocratic standing of individual persons, in order however to disappear again when the authority of the personality is extinguished through the mass insanity of democracy. The average man has the greatest fear of death and in reality thinks of it most rarely. The important man concerns himself with it most emphatically, and nevertheless fears it the least. The one lives blindly from day to day, sins heedlessly, in order suddenly to collapse before the inevitable. The other observes its coming most carefully and, to be sure, looks it in the eye with calm and composure.","To decide how great the danger was that this oldest civilized continent in the world would be overrun this winter will be left to later historical research.The unfading credit that this danger is over now goes to those soldiers whom we are commemorating today.Only a glance at Bolshevism\u2019s gigantic preparations for the destruction of our world is sufficient to let us realize with horror what might have become of Germany and the rest of the Continent, had not the National Socialist movement taken power in this state ten years ago, and had it not begun the rebuilding of the German Wehrmacht with the determination that is so peculiar to it, following many fruitless efforts for disarmament. After all, the Germany of Weimar with its Centrist-Marxist democratic party politics would have been swept away by this Central Asian invasion as a straw would be by a hurricane.We realize with increasing clarity that the confrontation that has taken place in Europe since the First World War is slowly beginning to look like a struggle which can only be compared with the greatest historic events of the past. Eternal Jewry forced on us a pitiless and merciless war. Should we not be able to stop the elements of destruction at Europe\u2019s borders, then this continent will be transformed into a single field of ruins.The gravest consequences of this war would then be not only the burned cities and destroyed cultural monuments, but also the bestially murdered multitudes, which would become the victim of this Central Asian flood, just as with the invasions by the Huns and Mongols.What the German and allied soldiers today protect in the east is not the stony face of this continent or its social and intellectual character, but its eternal human substance, whence all values originated ages and ages ago and which gave expression to all human civilizations today, not only to those in Europe and America.In addition to this world of barbarity threatening from the east, we are witnessing the satanic destructive frenzy of its ally, the so-called West. We know about our enemies\u2019 war objectives from countless publications, speeches, and open demands. The babble of the Atlantic Charter is worth as much as Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points in contrast with the implemented actual design of the Diktat of Versailles.Just as in the English parliamentary democracy the warmonger Churchill pointed the way for later developments with his claim in 1936, when he was not yet the responsible leader of Great Britain, that Germany had to be destroyed again, so the elements behind the present demands for peace in the same democracies today are already planning the state to which they seek to reduce Europe after the war.And their objectives totally correspond with the manifestations of their Bolshevik allies, which we have not only known about but also witnessed: the extermination of all continental people proudly conscious of their nationality and, at their head, the extermination of our own German people.It makes no difference whether English or American papers, parliamentarians, stump orators, or men of letters demand the destruction of the Reich, the abduction of the children of our Volk, the sterilization of our male youth, and so on, as the primary war objective, or whether Bolshevism implements the slaughter of whole groups of people, men, women, and children, in practice.After all, the driving force behind this remains the eternal hatred of that cursed race which, as a true scourge of God, chastised the nations for many thousands of years, until they began to defend themselves against their tormentors in times of reflection.Speech in Lichthof of the Zeughaus for the Heroes\u2019 Memorial Day Berlin, March 21, 1943","Perch\xe9 non ero nato cent\'anni prima? Al tempo della guerra, quando un uomo valeva qualcosa anche se non teneva bottega?","No se estudia, por consiguiente, la Historia para no recordar sus ense\xf1anzas, cuando llega la hora de aplicarlas pr\xe1cticamente, o para pensar que las cosas ahora son diferentes y que, por tanto, sus verdades no son aplicables.

It begins on the day when the purchaser is obliged to pay, for the same goods, a higher sum than that asked the day before. At that point, one must intervene. Even to Schacht, I had to begin by explaining this elementary truth: that the essential cause of the stability of our currency was to be sought for in our concentration camps. The currency remains stable when the speculators are put under lock and key. I also had to make Schacht understand that excess profits must be removed from economic circulation.I do not entertain the illusion that I can pay for everything out of my available funds. Simply, I\'ve read a lot, and I\'ve known how to profit by the experience of events in the past. Frederick the Great, already, had gradually withdrawn his devaluated thalers from circulation, and had thus re established the value of his currency.All these things are simple and natural.

At bottom, the only object of all these notions is to throw everything into confusion.The very simple ideas that happen to be mine have nowadays penetrated into the flesh and blood of millions. Only the professors don\'t understand that the value of money depends on the goods behind that money.One day I received some workers in the great hall at Obersalzberg, to give them an informal lecture on money. The good chaps understood me very well, and rewarded me with a storm of applause.To give people money is solely a problem of making paper. The whole question is to know whether the workers are producing goods to match the paper that\'s made. If work does not increase, so that production remains at the same level, the extra money they get won\'t enable them to buy more things than they bought before with less money.Obviously, that theory couldn\'t have provided the material for a learned dissertation. For a distinguished economist, the thing is, no matter what you\'re talking about, to pour out ideas in complicated meanderings and to use terms of Sibylline incomprehensibility.","\u0627\u0632 \u0645\u062f\u062a\u06cc \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u0645\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0645 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0642\u0633\u0645\u062a \u0647\u0627 \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u06a9\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0641\u0639 \u0645\u0644\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u063a\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u062c\u06cc\u0628 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0647\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f \u067e\u0633\u062a \u062d\u0627\u0636\u0631\u0646\u062f \u0645\u0644\u062a \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0638\u0648\u0631 \u0641\u062f\u0627 \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u0634\u062f \u06a9\u0634\u0648\u0631 \u0622\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u062f \u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0622\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u0644\u0627\u06cc\u0642 \u0686\u0648\u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0645\u060c \u062a\u0633\u0644\u06cc\u0645 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0622\u0646 \u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0641\u0647\u0648\u0645 \u0641\u062f\u0627 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0639 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06af\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u062a\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0645\u0644\u062a \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0686\u0646\u062f \u0646\u0641\u0631 \u0628\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0648\u0646\u062f.","Il ricordo della miseria intellettuale della massa operaia, la volgarit\xe0 dei rapporti che vi regnano, fa apparire una insopportabile molestia l\'idea di un qualsiasi contatto con quello stadio superato di cultura e di vita","The year 1944 was the year of the greatest burdens in this mighty struggle.It was a year that again proved conclusively that the bourgeois social order is no longer capable of braving the storms of the present or of the coming age.State after state that does not find its way to a truly social reorganization will go down the path to chaos. The liberal age is a thing of the past. The belief that you can counter this invasion of the people by parliamentary-democratic half-measures is childish and just as naive as Metternich\u2019s methods when the national drives for unification were making their way through the nineteenth century. The lack of a truly social, new form of life results in the lack of the mental will to resist not only in the nations but also in the lack of the moral power of resistance of their leaders. In all countries we see that the attempted renaissance of a democracy has proved fruitless. The confused tangle of political dilettantes and military politicians of a bygone bourgeois world who order each other around is, with deadly certainty, preparing for a plunge into chaos and, insofar as Europe is concerned, into an economic and ethnic catastrophe. And, after all, one thing has already been proved: this most densely populated continent in the world will either have to live with an order that gives the greatest consideration to individual abilities, guarantees the greatest accomplishments, and, by taming all egotistical drives, prevents their excesses, or states such as we have in central and western Europe will prove unfit for life, which means that their nations are thereby doomed to perish! In this manner-following the example of royal Italy-Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary collapsed during this year. This collapse is primarily the result of the cowardice and lack of resolve of their leaders. They and their actions can be understood only in light of the corrupt and socially amoral atmosphere of the bourgeois world. The hatred which many statesmen, especially in these countries, express for the present German Reich is nothing other than the voice of a guilty conscience, an expression of an inferiority complex in view of our organization of a human community that is suspicious to them because we successfully pursue goals that again do not correspond to their own narrow economic egotism and their resulting political shortsightedness.For us, my German Volksgenossen, this, however, represents a new obligation to recognize ever more clearly that the existence or nonexistence of a German future depends on the uncompromising organization of our Volksstaat, that all the sacrifices which our Volk must make are conceivable only under the condition of a social order which clears away all privileges and thereby makes the entire Volk not only bear the same duties but also possess the same vital rights. Above all, it must mercilessly destroy the social phantoms of a bygone era. In their stead, it must place the most valuable reality there is, namely the Volk, the masses which, tied together by the same blood, essence, and experiences of a long history, owe their origin as an individual existence not to an earthly arbitrariness but to the inscrutable will of the Almighty. The insight into the moral value of our conviction and the resulting objectives of our struggle for life give us and, above all, give me the strength to continue to wage this fight in the most difficult hours with the strongest faith and with an unshakable confidence. In such hours, this conviction also ties the Volk to its leadership. It assured the unanimous approval of the appeal that I was forced to direct to the German Volk in a particularly urgent way this year.New Year\u2019s Proclamation to the National Socialists and Party Comrades Fuhrer Headquarters, January 1, 1945","On the 22nd of June, a door opened before us, and we didn\'t know what was behind it.

La persistencia, en este caso, es, como en muchos otros de este mundo, la primera y m\xe1s importante condici\xf3n para el \xe9xito. Los temas de propaganda, precisamente, no pueden ser dirigidos por estetas, ni por \\"blas\xe9s\\". Los primeros imprimen, por la forma y por la expresi\xf3n, un sello a la propaganda que, dentro de poco, s\xf3lo tiene poder de atracci\xf3n en los c\xedrculos literarios; los segundos, deben ser cuidadosamente evitados, pues su falta de sensibilidad hace que se busquen constantemente nuevos atractivos. Esas personas se cansan de todo con facilidad; lo que ellos desean es la variedad y son incapaces de una comprensi\xf3n de las necesidades de sus conciudadanos todav\xeda no contaminados por su pesimismo. Ellos son siempre los primeros cr\xedticos de la propaganda, o, mejor dicho, de su contenido, el cual les parece demasiado arcaico, etc\xe9tera. S\xf3lo quieren novedades, s\xf3lo buscan variedad y se vuelven de esa forma enemigos mortales de una conquista eficiente de las masas, desde el punto de vista pol\xedtico. Despu\xe9s que una propaganda, en su organizaci\xf3n y en su contenido, comienza a orientarse por las necesidades de aqu\xe9llos, pierde toda unidad y se dispersa completamente. La propaganda, por consiguiente, no fue creada para proporcionar a esos se\xf1ores blas\xe9s una distracci\xf3n interesante y s\xed para convencer a la masa. \xc9sta necesita -por ser de m\xe1s lenta comprensi\xf3n- de un determinado per\xedodo de tiempo, antes de estar en condiciones de tomar conocimiento de un hecho y, solamente despu\xe9s de repetirles millares de veces los conceptos m\xe1s elementales, es cuando su memoria entrar\xe1 a retenerlos. La variaci\xf3n en la propaganda no debe alterar jam\xe1s el sentido de aquello que es el objeto de esa propaganda, sino que desde el principio hasta el fin debe significar siempre lo mismo. El motivo en cuesti\xf3n puede ser considerado desde puntos de vista diferentes, mas es condici\xf3n esencial que toda exposici\xf3n entra\xf1e en resumen, invariablemente, la misma f\xf3rmula. S\xf3lo de esta suerte es posible hacer que la propaganda sea eficaz y uniforme.

From then on, it had been inspired by the wish to ensure for its heirs a life free from care. It\'s a state of mind that entails the following corollary : the more heirs there are, the less each one of them receives. Hence the limitation of births. The power of each family depended to some extent on the number of slaves it possessed. Thus there grew up the plebs which was driven to multiplication, faced by a patrician class which was shrinking. The day when Christianity abolished the frontier that had hitherto separated the two classes, the Roman patriciate found itself submerged in the resulting mass. It\'s the fall in the birthrate that\'s at the bottom of everything.","Chi non aveva comprensione per la politica, perdeva per ci\xf2 stesso il diritto a ogni critica e a ogni protesta","And then came a damp, cold night in Flanders, through which we marched in silence, and when the day began to emerge from the mists, suddenly an iron greeting came whizzing at us over our heads, and with a sharp report sent the little pellets flying between our ranks, ripping up the wet ground; but even before the little cloud had passed, from two hundred throats the first hurrah rose to meet the first messenger of death. Then a crackling and a roaring, a singing and a howling began, and with feverish eyes each one of us was drawn forward, faster and faster, until suddenly past turnip fields and hedges the fight began, the fight of man against man. And from the distance the strains of a song reached our ears, coming closer and closer, leaping from company to company, and just as Death plunged a busy hand into our ranks, the song reached us too and we passed it along: Deutschland, Deutschland \xfcber Alles, \xfcber Alles in der Welt!","Those who know something of the juvenile spirit can understand how youth willalways lend a glad ear to such a rallying cry.","Decisi per ci\xf2 di tornare a lavorare in qualche cantiere.

To deserve its place in history, our people must be above all a people of warriors. This implies both privileges and obligations, the obligation of submitting to a most rigorous upbringing and the privilege of the healthy enjoyment of life. If a German soldier is expected to be ready to sacrifice his life without demur, then he is entitled to love freely and without restriction. In life, battle and love go hand in hand, and the inhibited little bourgeois must be content with the crumbs which remain. But if the warrior is to be kept in fighting trim, he must not be pestered with religious precepts which ordain abstinence of the flesh. A healthyminded man simply smiles when a saint of the Catholic Church like St. Anthony bids him eschew the greatest joy that life has to give, and offers him the solace of self-mortification and castigation in its place.","y fue la mano de la Diosa Justicia y de las leyes compensatorias la que hizo que el adversario principal del germanismo austr\xedaco, el Archiduque Francisco Fernando, cayera bajo el mismo plomo que \xe9l ayud\xf3 a fundir.","Whoever will not be a hammer in history, will be an anvil.","\u0130nsanlar\u0131n hayatlar\u0131n\u0131n en b\xfcy\xfck gayesi bir devletin devam\u0131n\u0131 teminden ibaret de\u011fildir.

Para los intelectuales, o para aquellos que hoy, lamentablemente, as\xed se consideran, no se debe hablar de propaganda y s\xed de instrucci\xf3n cient\xedfica. Semejantes son las condiciones con las que hoy designamos la palabra propaganda. El fin de la propaganda no es la educaci\xf3n cient\xedfica de cada cual, y s\xed llamar la atenci\xf3n de la masa sobre determinados hechos, necesidades, etc\xe9tera, cuya importancia s\xf3lo de esta forma entra en el c\xedrculo visual de la masa. El arte est\xe1 exclusivamente en hacer esto de una manera tan perfecta que provoque la convicci\xf3n de la realidad de un hecho, de la necesidad de un procedimiento, y de la justicia de algo necesario. La propaganda no es y no puede ser una necesidad en s\xed misma, ni una finalidad. De la misma manera como en el supuesto del cartel, su misi\xf3n es la de llamar la atenci\xf3n de la masa y no ense\xf1ar a los cultos o a aquellos que procuran cultivar su esp\xedritu; su acci\xf3n debe estar cada vez m\xe1s dirigida al sentimiento y s\xf3lo muy condicionalmente a la llamada raz\xf3n. Toda acci\xf3n de propaganda tiene que ser necesariamente popular y adaptar su nivel intelectual a la capacidad receptiva del m\xe1s limitado de aquellos a los cuales est\xe1 destinada. De ah\xed que su grado netamente intelectual deber\xe1 regularse tanto m\xe1s hacia abajo, y cuanto m\xe1s grande sea el conjunto de la masa humana que ha de abarcarse. Mas, cuando se trata de atraer hacia el radio de influencia de la propaganda a toda una Naci\xf3n, como exigen las circunstancias en el caso del sostenimiento de una guerra, nunca se podr\xe1 ser lo suficientemente prudente en lo que concierne a cuidar que las formas intelectuales de la propaganda sean simples en lo posible. Cuanto m\xe1s modesta sea su carga cient\xedfica y cuanto m\xe1s tenga en consideraci\xf3n el sentimiento de la masa, tanto mayor ser\xe1 su \xe9xito. Esto, sin embargo, es la mejor prueba de lo acertado o err\xf3neo de una propaganda, y no la satisfacci\xf3n de las exigencias de algunos sabios o j\xf3venes estetas. El arte de la propaganda reside justamente en la comprensi\xf3n de la mentalidad y de los sentimientos de la gran masa. Ella encuentra, por la forma psicol\xf3gicamente adecuada, el camino para la atenci\xf3n y para el coraz\xf3n del pueblo. Que nuestros sabios no comprendan esto, la causa reside en su pereza mental o en su orgullo. Comprendi\xe9ndose la necesidad de la conquista de la gran masa, por medio de la propaganda, se saca la siguiente conclusi\xf3n: es errado querer dar a la propaganda la variedad, por ejemplo, de la ense\xf1anza cient\xedfica. La capacidad receptiva de la gran masa es sumamente limitada y no menos peque\xf1a su facultad de comprensi\xf3n; en cambio, es enorme su falta de memoria. Teniendo en cuenta estos antecedentes, toda propaganda eficaz debe concretarse s\xf3lo a muy pocos puntos y saberlos explotar como apotegmas hasta que el \xfaltimo hijo del pueblo pueda formarse una idea de aquello que se persigue. En el momento en que la propaganda sacrifique ese principio o quiera hacerse m\xfaltiple, quedar\xe1 debilitada su eficacia por la sencilla raz\xf3n de que la masa no es capaz de retener ni asimilar todo lo que se le ofrece.

Disregarding the namby-pamby utterances about humanitarianism which they spread so assiduously in Germany, in their own country they drove their workers to an astonishing degree, and the Soviet worker was taught by means of the Stakhanov system to work both harder and longer than his counterpart in either Germany or the capitalist States. The more we see of conditions in Russia, the more thankful we must be that we struck in time. In another ten years there would have sprung up in Russia a mass of industrial centres, inaccessible to attack, which would have produced armaments on an inexhaustible scale, while the rest of Europe would have degenerated into a defenceless plaything of Soviet policy.It is very stupid to sneer at the Stakhanov system. The arms and equipment of the Russian armies are the best proof of its efficiency in the handling of industrial man power. Stalin, too, must command our unconditional respect. In his own way he is a hell of a fellow ! He knows his models, Genghiz Khan and the others, very well, and the scope of his industrial planning is exceeded only by our own Four Year Plan. And there is no doubt that he is quite determined that there shall be in Russia no unemployment such as one finds in such capitalist States as the United States of America...","Quanto pi\xf9 polemizzavo con loro, tanto pi\xf9 capivo la loro dialettica: se non trovavano le vie d\'uscita, facevano i finti tonti. Se neanche questo serviva, fingevano di non capire la questione, passavano a un altro argomento e non sostenevano altro che luoghi comuni, affermazioni che essi riportavano subito su un altro argomento per poter da qui, rifattisi sicuri, sfuggire alla stretta e non dire niente di preciso. Lo stupore dell\'indomani era ancora pi\xf9 grande: non si ricordava pi\xf9 del giorno prima, ricominciava a vomitare le sue solite storie come se non fosse successo niente, o ricordava solo quelle affermazioni che il giorno prima erano state accettate.

Actuando de ese modo brutal contra el individuo y llam\xe1ndolo de nuevo moment\xe1neamente a desaparecer, por no ser capaz de resistir la tempestad de la vida, la Naturaleza mantiene la Raza, la propia especie vigorosa y la hace capaz de las mayores realizaciones.

Esta correcci\xf3n de la voluntad divina le parece ser tan sabia como humana, y \xe9l se alegra m\xe1s de una vez por haber sobrepujado a la Naturaleza y hasta haber demostrado la insuficiencia de la misma.

This idea could have an injurious effect only in the measure in which its application became difficult and finally impossible.So, first of all, the fight, and then pacifism. If it were otherwise, it would mean that mankind has already passed the zenith of its development, and accordingly, the end would not be the supremacy of some moral ideal, but degeneration into barbarism and consequent chaos.People may laugh at this statement, but our planet moved through space for millions of years, uninhabited by men, and at some future date may easily begin to do so again, if men should forget that wherever they have reached a superior level of existence, it was not as a result of following the ideas of crazy visionaries but by acknowledging and rigorously observing the iron laws of Nature.What reduces one race to starvation stimulates another to harder work.All the great civilisations of the past became decadent because the originally creative race died out, as a result of contamination of the blood.The most profound cause of such a decline is to be found in the fact that the people ignored the principle that all culture depends on men, and not the reverse.In other words, in order to preserve a certain culture, the type of manhood that creates such a culture must be preserved, but such a preservation goes hand in hand with the inexorable law that it is the strongest and the best who must triumph and that they have the right to endure.He who would live must fight. He who does not wish to fight in this world, where permanent struggle is the law of life, has not the right to exist.Such a saying may sound hard, but, after all, that is how the matter really stands. Yet far harder is the lot of him who believes that he can overcome Nature, and thus in reality insults her. Distress, misery, and disease, are her rejoinders.Whoever ignores or despises the laws of race really deprives himself of the happiness to which he believes he can attain, for he places an obstacle in the victorious path of the superior race and, by so doing, he interferes with a prerequisite condition of, all human progress.Loaded with the burden of human sentiment, he falls back to the level of a helpless animal.It would be futile to attempt to discuss the question as to what race or races were the original champions of human culture and were thereby the real founders of all that we understand by the word \u2018humanity.\u2019It is much simpler to deal with this question in so far as it relates to the present time. Here the answer is simple and clear.Every manifestation of human culture, every product of art, science and technical skill, which we see before our eyes to-day, is almost, exclusively the product of the Aryan creative power. All that we admire in the world to-day, its science and its art, its technical developments and discoveries, are the products of the creative activities of a few peoples, and it may be true that their first beginnings must be attributed to one race.The existence of civilisation is wholly dependent on such peoples. Should they perish, all that makes this earth beautiful will descend with them into the grave.He is the Prometheus of mankind, from whose shining brow the divine spark of genius has at all times flashed forth, always kindling anew that fire which, in the form of knowledge, illuminated the dark night by drawing aside the veil of mystery and thus showing man how to rise and become master over all the other beings on the earth.Should he be forced to disappear, a profound darkness will descend on the earth; within a few thousand years human culture will vanish and the world will become a desert.","There never was a party more badly led than the Social Democratic Party; and yet the masses flocked to join and support it. This, it might be argued, was because they had no alternative choice; but that is not true.Man is not endowed by nature with the herd instinct, and it is only by the most rigorous methods that he can be induced to join the herd. He has the same urge as the dog, the rabbit and the hare, to couple up with one other being as a separate entity. The social State as such can be maintained only by a rule of iron; take away the laws, and the fabric falls immediately to pieces.","La gran divergencia entre los problemas del teorizante y los del pol\xedtico es uno de los motivos por los que casi nunca se encuentra una uni\xf3n entre los dos, en una misma persona. Esto se aplica sobre todo al llamado pol\xedtico de \\"\xe9xito\\", de peque\xf1o porte, cuya actividad de facto no es nada m\xe1s que el \\"arte de lo posible\\", como modestamente Bismarck denominaba a la pol\xedtica. Cuanto m\xe1s libre se mantiene el pol\xedtico de grandes ideas, tanto m\xe1s f\xe1ciles, comunes, r\xe1pidos y tambi\xe9n visibles ser\xe1n sus \xe9xitos. Aunque es verdad tambi\xe9n que \xe9stos est\xe1n destinados al olvido de los hombres y, a veces, no llegan ni a sobrevivir a la muerte de sus creadores. La obra de tales pol\xedticos es, de modo general, sin valor alguno para la posteridad, pues su \xe9xito eventual reposa en el alejamiento de todos los problemas e ideas grandiosas que como tales hubieran sido de gran importancia para las generaciones venideras. La realizaci\xf3n de ideas destinadas a tener influencia sobre el futuro es poco lucrativa y s\xed muy raramente comprendida por la gran masa, a la que interesan m\xe1s las reducciones de precio en la cerveza y en la leche que los grandes planes de futuro, de realizaci\xf3n tard\xeda y cuyo beneficio, al final, s\xf3lo ser\xe1 usufructuado por la posteridad. Es as\xed como, por una cierta vanidad, la que est\xe1 siempre asociada a la pol\xedtica, la mayor\xeda de los pol\xedticos se apartan de los proyectos realmente dif\xedciles, para no perder la simpat\xeda de la gran masa. El \xe9xito y la importancia de ese pol\xedtico residen exclusivamente en el presente, y son inexistentes para la posteridad. Esos microc\xe9falos poco se enfadan por eso; ellos se contentan con poco. Diferentes son las condiciones del teorizante. Su importancia casi siempre est\xe1 en el futuro, por eso no es raro que se le considere lun\xe1tico. Si el arte del pol\xedtico era considerado el arte de lo posible, se puede decir del idealista que \xe9l pertenece a aquellos que s\xf3lo agradan a los dioses cuando exigen o quieren lo imposible. \xc9l tendr\xe1 casi siempre que renunciar al reconocimiento del presente; adquiere, por ello, en el caso de que sus ideas sean inmortales, la gloria de la posteridad. En per\xedodos raros de la historia de la Humanidad puede acontecer que el pol\xedtico y el idealista se re\xfanan en la misma persona. Cuanto m\xe1s \xedntima fuese esa uni\xf3n, tanto mayores ser\xe1n las resistencias opuestas a la acci\xf3n del pol\xedtico. \xc9l no trabaja ya m\xe1s para las necesidades al alcance del primer burgu\xe9s, y s\xed por los ideales que s\xf3lo pocos comprenden. Es por eso que su vida es blanco del amor y del odio. La protesta del presente, que no comprende al hombre, lucha con el reconocimiento de la posteridad por la cual \xe9l trabaja. Cuanto mayores fueran las obras de un hombre para el futuro, tanto menos ser\xe1n \xe9stas comprendidas por el presente; cuanto m\xe1s dura sea la lucha, tanto m\xe1s raro el \xe9xito. Si en a\xf1os nada le sonr\xede, es posible que en sus \xfaltimos d\xedas le circunde un tenue halo de gloria venidera. Es cierto que esos grandes hombres son los corredores del marat\xf3n de la Historia. La corona de laurel del presente se pone m\xe1s com\xfanmente en las sienes del h\xe9roe moribundo. Entre \xe9stos se encuentran los grandes luchadores que, incomprendidos por el presente, est\xe1n decididos a luchar por sus ideas y sus ideales. Son \xe9stos los que, tarde o temprano, tocar\xe1n el coraz\xf3n del pueblo. Hasta parece que cada uno siente el deber de, en el presente, redimir el pecado cometido en el pasado. Su vida y acci\xf3n est\xe1n acompa\xf1adas de cerca por la admiraci\xf3n conmovedoramente grata, lo que consigue, sobre todo en los d\xedas de tristeza, levantar corazones destrozados y almas desesperadas.

I suppose that some people are clutching their heads with both hands to find an answer to this question: \\"How can the Fuehrer destroy a city like St. Petersburg?\\" Plainly I belong by nature to quite another species. I would prefer not to see anyone suffer, not to do harm to anyone. But when I realise that the species is in danger, then in my case sentiment gives way to the coldest reason.

I said as much before the German Reichstag on September 1, 1939. I wish to avoid making hasty prophesies, but this war will not end as the Jews imagine, namely, in the extermination of the European-Aryan people; instead, the result of this war will be the annihilation of Jewry. For the first time, the old, truly Jewish rule of \u201can eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, will obtain. And the more the fighting expands, the more anti-Semitism will spread - let that be said to world Jewry.

It was desired and instigated exclusively by those international statesmen who were either of Jewish origin or working for Jewish interests. I have made so many offers for the reduction and elimination of armaments, which posterity cannot explain away for all eternity, that the responsibility for the outbreak of this war cannot rest on me. Furthermore, I never desired that after the first terrible World War a second war should arise against England or even against America. Centuries may pass, but out of the ruins of our cities and monuments of art there will arise anew the hatred for the people who alone are ultimately responsible: International Jewry and its helpers! As late as three days before the outbreak of the German-Polish War, I proposed to the British Ambassador in Berlin a solution for the German-Polish problem -- similar to the problem of the Saar area, under international control. This offer cannot be explained away, either. It was only rejected because the responsible circles in English politics wanted the war, partly in the expectation of business advantages, partly driven by propaganda promoted by international Jewry. But I left no doubt about the fact that if the peoples of Europe were again only regarded as so many packages of stock shares by these international money and finance conspirators, then that race, too, which is the truly guilty party in this murderous struggle would also have to be held to account: the Jews! I further left no doubt that this time we would not permit millions of European children of Aryan descent to die of hunger, nor millions of grown-up men to suffer death, nor hundreds of thousands of women and children to be burned and bombed to death in their cities, without the truly guilty party having to atone for its guilt, even if through more humane means.","En ninguna ciudad alemana pod\xeda estudiarse mejor que en Viena el problema social.

In spite of this, a concern weighed heavily on me. It was clear to me that, ultimately, behind this war was that incendiary who has always lived off the quarrels of nations: the international Jew. I would no longer have been a National Socialist had I ever distanced myself from this realization.We followed his traces over many years. In this Reich, probably for the first time, we scientifically resolved this problem for all time, according to plan, and really understood the words of a great Jew who said that the racial question was the key to world history. Therefore, we knew quite well-above all, knew-that the driving force behind these occurrences was the Jew. And that, as always in history, there were blockheads ready to stand up for him: partly spineless, paid characters, partly people who want to make deals and, at no time, flinch from having blood spilled for these deals. I have come to know these Jews as the incendiaries of the world.Adolf Hitler \u2013 speech in the L\xf6wenbr\xe4ukellerMunich, November 8, 1941","La burgues\xeda ve tranquilamente c\xf3mo en el teatro y en el cine, y mediante la literatura obscena y la prensa inmunda, se echa sobre el pueblo d\xeda a d\xeda el veneno a borbotones.

As we know today, this war had long been decided on by the rulers in the Kremlin. With every new year, things would have become more difficult.All other events pale in comparison with the greatness of this gigantic struggle. Should the new Central Asian rush on Europe succeed, then the present world would crack, just as the old one cracked when confronted by the Hun invasion. Mankind\u2019s work over thousands of years would again have been in vain. Chaos would take the place of the most thriving continent on earth. Its culture would be replaced by inconceivable barbarity.What has been achieved since the year 1933 in the economic, cultural, and political realms pales, in spite of its greatness, in comparison with the task that we face today. Even if National Socialism had achieved no more than what lies behind it, it would already belong among the greatest phenomena in world history, but Europe would still be lost.Adolf Hitler \u2013 proclamation for the 10-th anniversary of the Power Taking January 30, 1943","In death I will look for a release from my sorrows and sleepless nights and from this nervous suffering. It takes only the fraction of a second - then one is cast free from all that and rests in eternal peace.","In 1933 things were still being taught in the higher educational establishments which had been proven by science to be false as long ago as 1899. The young man who wishes to keep abreast of the times, therefore, had to accept a double load on his unfortunate brain. In a hundred years\' time, the number of people wearing spectacles, and the size of the human brain, will both have increased considerably; but the people will be none the more intelligent. What they will look like, with their enormous, bulging heads, it is better not to try to imagine; they will probably be quite content with their own appearance, but if things continue in the manner predicted by the scientists, I think we can count ourselves lucky that we shall not live to see them!When I was a schoolboy, I did all I could to get out into the open air as much as possible\u2014my school reports bear witness to that ! In spite of this, I grew up into a reasonably intelligent young man, I developed along very normal lines, and I learnt a lot of things of which my schoolfellows learnt nothing. In short, our system of education is the exact opposite of that practised in the gymnasia of ancient days. The Greek of the golden age sought a harmonious education; we succeed only in producing intellectual monsters. Without the introduction of conscription, we should have fallen into complete decadence, and it is thanks to this universal military service that the fatal process has been arrested. This I regard as one of the greatest events in history. When I recall my masters at school, I realise that half of them were abnormal; and the greater the distance from which I look back on them, the stronger is my conviction that I am quite right.The primary task of education is to train the brain of the young. It is quite impossible to recognise the potential aspirations of a child of ten. In old days teachers strove always to seek out each pupil\'s weak point, and by exposing and dwelling on it, they successfully killed the child\'s self-confidence. Had they, on the contrary, striven to find the direction in which each pupil\'s talents lay, and then concentrated on the development of those talents, they would have furthered education in its true sense. Instead, they sought mass-production by means of endless generalisations. A child who could not solve a mathematical equation, they said, would do no good in life. It is a wonder that they did not prophesy that he would come to a bad and shameful end!Have things changed much to-day, I wonder? I am not sure, and many of the things I see around me incline me to the opinion that they have not.","So long as the paternal plan to make a State functionary contradicted my own inclinations only in the abstract, the conflict was easy to bear.","The fact that nine-tenths of all the smutty literature, artistic tripe and theatrical banalities, had to be charged to the account of people who formed scarcely one per cent. of the nation - that fact could not be gainsaid. It was there, and had to be admitted.","what are called the middle schools is still very unsatisfactory. Few teachers realize that the purpose of teaching history is not the memorizing of some dates and facts, that the student is not interested in knowing the exact date of a battle or the birthday of some marshal or other, and not at all - or at least only very insignificantly - interested in knowing when the crown of his fathers was placed on the brow of some monarch. These are certainly not looked upon as important matters.","We realize with increasing clarity that the confrontation that has taken place in Europe since the First World War is slowly beginning to look like a struggle which can only be compared with the greatest historic events of the past. Eternal Jewry forced on us a pitiless and merciless war. Should we not be able to stop the elements of destruction at Europe\u2019s borders, then this continent will be transformed into a single field of ruins.The gravest consequences of this war would then be not only the burned cities and destroyed cultural monuments, but also the bestially murdered multitudes, which would become the victim of this Central Asian flood, just as with the invasions by the Huns and Mongols.What the German and allied soldiers today protect in the east is not the stony face of this continent or its social and intellectual character, but its eternal human substance, whence all values originated ages and ages ago and which gave expression to all human civilizations today, not only to those in Europe and America.Adolf Hitler \u2013 speech in Lichthof of the Zeughaus for the Heroes\u2019 Memorial Day Berlin, March 21, 1943","Bajo el concepto de lectura, concibo cosas muy diferentes de lo que piensa la gran mayor\xeda de los llamados intelectuales. Conozco individuos que leen much\xedsimo, libro tras libro y letra por letra, y sin embargo no pueden ser tildados de \\"lectores\\". Poseen una multitud de \\"conocimientos\\", pero su cerebro no consigue ejecutar una distribuci\xf3n y un registro del material adquirido. Les falta el arte de separar, en el libro, lo que es de valor y lo que es in\xfatil, conservar para siempre en la memoria lo que en verdad interesa, pudiendo saltarse y desechar lo que no les comporta ventaja alguna, para no retener lo in\xfatil y sin objeto. La lectura no debe entenderse como un fin en s\xed misma, sino como medio para alcanzar un objetivo. En primer lugar, la lectura debe auxiliar la formaci\xf3n del esp\xedritu, despertar las inclinaciones intelectuales y las vocaciones de cada cual. Enseguida, debe proveer el instrumento, el material de que cada uno tiene necesidad en su profesi\xf3n, tanto para simple seguridad del pan como para la satisfacci\xf3n de los m\xe1s elevados designios. En segundo lugar, debe proporcionar una idea de conjunto del mundo. En ambos casos, es necesario que el contenido de cualquier lectura no sea aprendido de memoria de un conjunto de libros, sino que sea como peque\xf1os mosaicos en un cuadro m\xe1s amplio, cada uno en su lugar, en la posici\xf3n que les corresponde, ayudando de esta forma a esquematizarlo en el cerebro del lector. De otra forma, resulta un bric-\xe1-brac de materias memorizadas, enteramente in\xfatiles, que transforman a su poseedor en un presuntuoso, seriamente convencido de ser un hombre instruido, de entender algo de la vida, de poseer cultura, cuando la verdad es que con cada aumento de esa clase de conocimientos, m\xe1s se aparta del mundo, hasta que termina en un sanatorio o como pol\xedtico en un parlamento.","The secret of the miracle of life will never reveal itself to the pale theoretician. He will always see amiss the mighty formative force of existence that he himself most sorely lacks, namely: willpower, boldness in making and carrying out decisions. Speech in the Berlin Zeughaus, Heroes\' Memorial Day March 10, 1940","Christianity is the worst of the regressions that mankind can ever have undergone, and it\'s the Jew who, thanks to this diabolic invention, has thrown him back fifteen centuries. The only thing that would be still worse would be victory for the Jew through Bolshevism. If Bolshevism triumphed, mankind would lose the gift of laughter and joy. It would become merely a shapeless mass, doomed to greyness and despair.","Aceptando, en n\xfamero excesivo, elementos moderados burgueses, la tendencia general del Movimiento estar\xe1 dirigida por \xe9stos, quedando as\xed excluida la posibilidad de reclutar fuerzas valiosas en el seno de la gran masa popular.

Questi territori non sono stati tenuti in serbo dalla natura per certe razze, ma sono territori aperti ai popoli che possiedono la forza di conquistarli e la diligenza di coltivarli. La natura non conosce frontiere politiche: il pi\xf9 forte per coraggio e diligenza ottiene il diritto di signoria sulla vita","One needs great tenacity and a tremendous will to begin such an enterprise at all. And I should like to say this to you: If I had this faith, I had it only because I knew the people and because I had no doubts as to the quality of the German people.","With the increasing recognition of Jews as the parasitic germs of these diseases, state after state was forced in the last years to take a position on this fateful question for nations. Imbued with the instinct of self-preservation, they had to take those measures which were suited to protect for good their own people against this international poison.Even if Bolshevik Russia is the concrete product of this Jewish infection, one should not forget that democratic capitalism creates the conditions for it.In this way, the Jews prepare what the same Jews execute in the second stage of this process. In the first stage, they deprive the majority of men of their rights and reduce them to helpless slaves. Or, as they themselves put it, they make them expropriated proletarians in order to spur them on, as a fanaticized mob, to destroy the foundations of their state. Later, this is followed by the extermination of their own national intelligentsia, and finally by the elimination of all cultural foundations that, as a thousand-year-old heritage, could provide these people with their inner worth or serve as a warning to the future. What remains after that is the beast in man and a Jewish class that, as parasites in leadership positions, will in the end destroy the fertile soil on which it thrives.On this process-which according to Mommsen results in the Jewish engineered decomposition of people and states-the young, awakening Europe has now declared war. Proud and honorable people in other parts of the world have allied themselves to it. They will be joined by hundreds of millions of oppressed men who, irrespective of how their present leaders may view this, will one day break their chains. The end of these liars will come, liars who claim to protect the world against a threatening domination but who actually only seek to save their own world-rule.We are now in the midst of this mighty, truly historic awakening of the people, partly as leading, acting, or performing men. On the one side stand the men of the democracies that form the heart of Jewish capitalism, with their whole dead weight of dusty theories of state, their parliamentary corruption, their outdated social order, their Jewish brain trusts, their Jewish newspapers, stock exchanges, and banks-a combination, a mix of political and economic racketeers of the worst sort; on their side, there is the Bolshevik state, that is, that number of brutish men over whom the Jew, as in the Soviet Union, wields his bloody whip. And on the other side stand those nations who fight for their freedom and independence, for the securing of their people\u2019s daily bread.Adolf Hitler \u2013 speech to the Reichstag April 26, 1942","Explaining it to Albert Speer - We will not capitulate - no, never! We may be destroyed, but if we are, we shall drag a world with us - a world in flames.","Believe me, you will never achieve national reconciliation on the basis of the present parties. This reconciliation is what National Socialism seeks to achieve. Our national ideal is identical with our social ideal. We are National Socialists, that is to say what we understand by the word nation is not one class, nor one economic group; the nation is for us the collective term for all people who speak our language and possess our blood. We see no possibility for pride in the nation if there is a well-fed group of entrepreneurs and behind them the starving and exhausted working people of our nation. National pride is possible only if intellectual and manual laborers, well fed and with a decent standard of living, can live side by side in harmony. We want to build the foundation for a new view of the world (Weltanschauung) in which greatness attaches only to the person who sacrifices himself out of passionate devotion to his entire People. We are convinced that no one in the world will give us anything for nothing. No one else is furthering our cause, we alone must forge our own future. Within our nation lies the source of our entire strength. If our nation falls we shall all fall with it. We cannot prosper if our nation is destroyed. Our nation and our state shall prosper so that each individual in it can live. We are not pacifists, for we know that the father of all things is combat and struggle. We see that race is of supreme importance to the life of our nation as well as character, the basis of which must be responsibility toward our People. We are absolutely convinced that every decision requires responsibility. That is why we are at odds with the entire world, that is why we are considered subversive and why we are prohibited from speaking, and why we are silenced, because we want to restore the health of our entire German nation and to cure it from this cursed sickness of fragmentation.

As before, during, and after the First World War in our country, so today the Jews and again only the Jews have to be held responsible for tearing apart the nations.There is a difference, however, if we compare the present world struggle with the end of the war from 1914\u20131918. In 1919, we National Socialists were a small group of believers who not only recognized the international enemy of mankind but also fought him. Today, the ideas of our National Socialist and Fascist revolution have conquered great and mighty states. My prophecy will be fulfilled that this war will not destroy the Aryan, but, instead, it will exterminate the Jew. Whatever the struggle may bring, however long it may last, this will be its final result. And only then, after the elimination of these parasites, a long era of international understanding, and therefore of true peace, will come over the suffering world.Adolf Hitler \u2013 proclamation for the 22-th anniversary of the N.S.D.A.P.

It has risen in opposition to the Jewish determination to dominate the world; it has attacked them everywhere and in every sphere of activity; it has flung them out of the positions they have usurped; it has pursued them in every direction, determined to purge the German world of the Jewish poison. For us, this has been an essential process of disinfection, which we have prosecuted to its ultimate limit and without which we should ourselves have been asphyxiated and destroyed....Quick to realize the danger, the Jews decided to stake their all in the life and death struggle which they launched against us. National Socialism had to be destroyed, whatever the cost and even if the whole world were destroyed in the process. Never before had there been a war so typically and at the same time so exclusively Jewish.I have at least compelled them to discard their masks.

According to his own evidence, he decided to break off these studies \\"so as not to become a perfect imbecile\\". Dietrich Eckart, by the way, is the man who had the brilliant idea of nailing the present juridical doctrines to the pillory and publishing the result in a form easily accessible to the German people. For myself, I supposed it was enough to say these things in an abbreviated form. It\'s only with time that I\'ve come to realise my mistake.Thus to-day I can declare without circumlocution that every jurist must be regarded as a man deficient by nature, or else deformed by usage. When I go over the names of the lawyers I\'ve known in my life, and especially the advocates, I cannot help recognising by contrast how morally wholesome, honourable and rooted in the best traditions were the men with whom Dietrich Eckart and I began our struggle in Bavaria.","If the war had remained a war conducted by Germany, and not by the Axis, we should have been in a position to attack Russia by 15th May 1941.

Contrary to popular belief, it is wrong to suppose that virginity is a particularly desirable quality; one cannot help suspecting that those who have been spared have nothing particular to offer ! And what is popularly said on the subject of Christian virgins I hesitate to repeat.

So the Jew smacks his thighs to see how his diabolic stratagem has succeeded. He bears in mind that if his victims suddenly became aware of these things, all Jews would be exterminated. But, this time, the Jews will disappear from Europe.The world will breathe freely and recover its sense of joy, when this weight is no longer crushing its shoulders.","The significance of a political philosopher does not depend on the practical success of the plans he lays down but rather on their absolute truth and the influence they exert on the progress of mankind.

The German demands for a revision were an absolute necessity, a matter of course for the existence and the honor of any great people. Posterity will some day come to regard them as exceedingly modest.All these demands had to be carried through, in practice against the will of the British French potentates. Now more than ever we all see it as a success of the leadership of the Third Reich that the realization of these revisions was possible for years without resort to war. This was not the case-as the British and French demagogues would have it-because we were not then in a position to wage war. When it finally appeared as though, thanks to a gradually awakening common sense, a peaceful resolution of the remaining problems could be reached through international cooperation, the agreement concluded in this spirit on September 29, 1938, at Munich by the four great states predominantly involved, was not welcomed by public opinion in London and Paris, but was condemned as a despicable sign of weakness. The Jewish capitalist warmongers, their hands covered with blood, saw in the possible success of such a peaceful revision the vanishing of plausible grounds for the realization of their insane plans.Once again that conspiracy of pitiful, corrupt political creatures and greedy financial magnates made its appearance, for whom war is a welcome means to bolster business. The international Jewish poison of the peoples began to agitate against and to coroode healthy minds. Men of letters set out to portray decent men who desired peace as weaklings and traitors, to denounce opposition parties as a \u201cfifth column, in order to eliminate internal resistance to their criminal policy of war.

There was never a greater mistake. The German people today are united as one man, and I have the support of every German. I can see no hope for the establishment of any lasting peace until the will of England and France to destroy Germany is itself destroyed. I fear that there is no way by which the will to destroy Germany can be itself destroyed, except through a German victory. I believe that German might is such as to ensure the triumph of Germany but, if not, we will all go down together (and here he added the extraordinary phrase) whether that be for better or for worse. He paused a moment and then said textually, rapidly and with impatience, \u201cI did not want this war. It has been forced upon me against my will. It is a waste of my time. My life should have been spent in constructing, and not in destroying.\u201dSpecial mission to Europe of Sumner Welles, Undersecretary of State. Exchanges of views regarding the possibility of peace and on postwar problems. Berlin, March 2, 1940\u201d","The sensational event of the ancient world was the mobilisation of the underworld against the established order. This enterprise of Christianity had no more to do with religion than Marxist socialism has to do with the solution of the social problem. The notions represented by Jewish Christianity were strictly unthinkable to Roman brains. The ancient world had a liking for clarity. Scientific research was encouraged there. The gods, for the Romans, were familiar images. It is some what difficult to know whether they had any exact idea of the Beyond. For them, eternal life was personified in living beings, and it consisted in a perpetual renewal. Those were conceptions fairly close to those which were current amongst the Japanese and Chinese at the time when the Swastika made its appearance amongst them.It was necessary for the Jew to appear on the scene and introduce that mad conception of a life that continues into an alleged Beyond! It enables one to regard life as a thing that is negligible here below\u2014since it will flourish later, when it no longer exists. Under cover of a religion, the Jew has introduced intolerance in a sphere in which tolerance formerly prevailed. Amongst the Romans, the cult of the sovereign intelligence was associated with the modesty of a humanity that knew its limits, to the point of consecrating altars to the unknown god.The Jew who fraudulently introduced Christianity into the ancient world\u2014in order to ruin it\u2014re-opened the same breach in modern times, this time taking as his pretext the social question. It\'s the same sleight-of-hand as before. Just as Saul was changed into St. Paul, Mardochai became Karl Marx.Peace can result only from a natural order. The condition of this order is that there is a hierarchy amongst nations. The most capable nations must necessarily take the lead. In this order, the subordinate nations get the greater profit, being protected by the more capable nations.It is Jewry that always destroys this order. It constantly provokes the revolt of the weak against the strong, of bestiality against intelligence, of quantity against quality. It took fourteen centuries for Christianity to reach the peak of savagery and stupidity. We would therefore be wrong to sin by excess of confidence and proclaim our definite victory over Bolshevism. The more we render the Jew incapable of harming us, the more we shall protect ourselves from this danger. The Jew plays in nature the r\xf4le of a catalysing element. A people that is rid of its Jews returns spontaneously to the natural order.In 1925 I wrote in Mein Kampf (and also in an unpublished work) that world Jewry saw in Japan an opponent beyond its reach. The racial instinct is so developed amongst the Japanese therefore compelled to act from outside. It would be to the considered interests of England and the United States to come to an understanding with Japan, but the Jew will strive to prevent such an understanding. I gave this warning in vain. A question arises. Does the Jew act consciously and by calculation, or is he driven on by his instinct? I cannot answer that question.The intellectual \xe9lite of Europe (whether professors of faculties, high officials, or whatever else) never understood anything of this problem. The \xe9lite has been stuffed with false ideas, and on these it lives. It propagates a science that causes the greatest possible damage. Stunted men have the philosophy of stunted men. They love neither strength nor health, and they regard weakness and sickness as supreme values.Since it\'s the function that creates the organ, entrust the world for a few centuries to a German professor\u2014and you\'ll soon have a mankind of cretins, made up of men with big heads set upon meagre bodies.","Il compito dello Stato nei confronti del capitale era perci\xf2 semplice e chiaro: esso doveva badare a che restasse il servitore dello Stato e non cercasse di diventare il padrone della Nazione. Questa posizione correva perci\xf2 lungo due direzioni: conservazione di un\'economia nazionale ed indipendente da una parte, assicurazione dei diritti sociali degli operai dall\'altra","For us there are only two possibilities: either we remain German or we come under the thumb of the Jews. This latter must not occur; even if we are small, we are a force. A well organised group can conquer a strong enemy. If you stick close together and keep bringing in new people, we will be victorious over the Jews.November 9, 1921 in M\xfcnchen","It is a great pity that this tendency towards religious thought can find no better outlet than the Jewish pettifoggery of the Old Testament. For religious people who, in the solitude of winter, continually seek ultimate light on their religious problems with the assistance of the Bible, must eventually become spiritually deformed. The wretched people strive to extract truths from these Jewish chicaneries, where in fact no truths exist. As a result they become embedded in some rut of thought or other and, unless they possess an exceptionally commonsense mind, degenerate into religious maniacs.It is deplorable that the Bible should have been translated into German, and that the whole of the German people should have thus become exposed to the whole of this Jewish mumbo-jumbo. So long as the wisdom, particularly of the Old Testament, remained exclusively in the Latin of the Church, there was little danger that sensible people would become the victims of illusions as the result of studying the Bible. But since the Bible became common property, a whole heap of people have found opened to them lines of religious thought which\u2014particularly in conjunction with the German characteristic of persistent and somewhat melancholy meditation\u2014as often as not turned them into religious maniacs. When one recollects further that the Catholic Church has elevated to the status of Saints a whole number of madmen, one realises why movements such as that of the Flagellants came inevitably into existence in the Middle Ages in Germany.As a sane German, one is flabbergasted to think that German human beings could have let themselves be brought to such a pass by Jewish filth and priestly twaddle, that they were little different from the howling dervish of the Turks and the negroes, at whom we laugh so scornfully. It angers one to think that, while in other parts of the globe religious teaching like that of Confucius, Buddha and Mohammed offers an undeniably broad basis for the religious-minded, Germans should have been duped by a theological exposition devoid of all honest depth.","The discovery of the Jewish virus is one of the greatest revolutions that have taken place in the world. The battle in which we are engaged to-day is of the same sort as the battle waged, during the last century, by Pasteur and Koch. How many diseases have their origin in the Jewish virus !Japan would have been contaminated, too, if it had stayed open to the Jews.We shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jew. Everything has a cause, nothing comes by chance.","I make a distinction between the wisdom of age - which can only arise from the greater profundity and foresight that are based on the experiences of a long life - and the creative genius of youth, which blossoms out in thought and ideas with inexhaustible fertility, without being able to put these into practice immediately, because of their very superabundance. These furnish the building materials and plans for the future; and it is from them that age takes the stones and builds the edifice, unless the so-called wisdom of the years may have smothered the creative genius of youth.","Es preciso que los escritorzuelos y haraganes de hoy sepan que las mayores revoluciones de este mundo nunca fueron acaudilladas por escritores de librillos. No, apenas se limitaron a trazar las bases te\xf3ricas de las revoluciones. Desde tiempos inmemoriales, la fuerza que impuls\xf3 las grandes avalanchas hist\xf3ricas de \xedndole pol\xedtica y religiosa no fue jam\xe1s otra que la magia de la palabra hablada. La gran masa cede ante todo al poder de la oratoria. Todos los grandes Movimientos son reacciones populares, son erupciones volc\xe1nicas de pasiones humanas y emociones afectivas aleccionadas, ora por la Diosa cruel de la Miseria, ora por la antorcha de la palabra lanzada en el seno de las masas, pero jam\xe1s por el alm\xedbar de literatos esteticistas y h\xe9roes de sal\xf3n. \xdanicamente un hurac\xe1n de pasiones ardientes puede cambiar el Destino de los pueblos; mas despertar pasi\xf3n es s\xf3lo atributo de quien en s\xed mismo siente el fuego pasional.

And thus the adoption of such a law would provoke chaos in the structure of the greatest organism that we know, with the result that the inhabitants of this earthly planet would finally disappear.","Surely nobody believes that these chosen representatives of the nation are the choice spirits or first-class intellects.","I was shown a questionnaire drawn up by the Ministry of the Interior, which it was proposed to put to people whom it was deemed desirable to sterilise. At least three-quarters of the questions asked would have defeated my own good mother. One I recall was: \\"Why does a ship made of steel float in the water?\\" If this system had been introduced before my birth, I am pretty sure I should never have been born at all!Let us, for God\'s sake, throw open the windows and let the fresh air blow away nonsense of this nature ! Put the young men into the Army, whence they will return refreshed and cleansed of eight years of scholastic slime !In the olden days we were an energetic people; but gradually we developed into a people of poets and thinkers. Poets do not matter, for no one takes them seriously ; but the world is greatly overburdened with \\"thinkers\\". I keep a bust of Scharnhorst on my table ; it is he who started our people back on the road to sanity. The world at large welcomed this Germany of poetsand thinkers, because it knew how they sapped our virility.","We want to build up a new state! That is why the others hate us so much today. They have often said as much. They said: \u201cYes, their social experiment is very dangerous! If it takes hold, and our own workers come to see this too, then this will be highly disquieting. It costs billions and does not bring any results. It cannot be expressed in terms of profit, nor of dividends. What is the point?! We are not interested in such a development. We welcome everything which serves the material progress of mankind insofar as this progress translates into economic profit. But social experiments, all they are doing there, this can only lead to the awakening of greed in the masses. Then we will have to descend from our pedestal. They cannot expect this of us. And we were seen as setting a bad example. Any institution we conceived was rejected, as it served social purposes. They already regarded this as a concession on the way to social legislation and thereby to the type of social development these states loathe. They are, after all, plutocracies in which a tiny clique of capitalists dominate the masses, and this, naturally, in close cooperation with international Jews and Freemasons.If they do not find a reasonable solution, the states with unresolved social problems will, sooner or later, arrive at an insane solution. National Socialism has prevented this in the German Volk. They are now aware of our objectives. They know how persistently and decisively we defend and will reach this goal.Hence the hatred of all the international plutocrats, the Jewish newspapers, the world stock markets, and hence the sympathy for these democrats in all the countries of a like cast of mind. Because we, however, know that what is at stake in this war is the entire social structure of our Volk, and that this war is being waged against the substance of our life, we must, time and time again in this war of ideals, avow these ideals. And, in this sense, the Winterhilfswerk, this greatest social relief fund there is on this earth, is a mighty demonstration of this spirit.Adolf Hitler - speech at the Berlin Sportpalast on the opening of the Kriegswinterhilfswerk September 4, 1940\u201d","It\'s only in the realm of music that I can find no satisfaction. The same thing is happening to music as is happening to beauty in a world dominated by the shavelings\u2014the Christian religion is an enemy to beauty. The Jew has brought off the same trick upon music. He has created a new inversion of values and replaced the loveliness of music by noises. Surely the Athenian, when he entered the Parthenon to contemplate the image of Zeus, must have had another impression than the Christian who must resign himself to contemplating the grimacing face of a man crucified.Since my fourteenth year I have felt liberated from the superstition that the priests used to teach. Apart from a few Holy Joes, I can say that none of my comrades went on believing in the miracle of the eucharist.The only difference between then and now is that in those days I was convinced one must blow up the whole show with dynamite.","Order and security became more important than a political freedom and that was synonymous with violence and bloodshed. Hitler saw these problems and spoke directly to people\u2019s fears and desires. The German people wanted a strong leader to solve their problems, a leader who could return their national self-respect.","Like a woman, . . . who will submit to the strong man rather than dominate the weakling, thus the masses love the ruler rather than the suppliant, and inwardly they are far more satisfied by a doctrine which tolerates no rival than by the grant of liberal freedom; they often feel at a loss what to do with it, and even easily feel themselves deserted. They neither realize the impudence with which they are spiritually terrorized, nor the outrageous curtailment of their human liberties for in no way does the delusion of this doctrine dawn on them.","The period stretching between the middle of the third and the middle of the seventeenth century is certainly the worst humanity has ever known : blood-lust, ignominy, lies.I don\'t consider that what has been should necessarily exist for the simple reason that it has been. Providence has endowed man with intelligence precisely to enable him to act with discernment. My discernment tells me that an end must be put to the reign of lies. It likewise tells me that the moment is not opportune. To avoid making myself an accomplice to the lies, I\'ve kept the shavelings out of the Party. I\'m not afraid of the struggle. It will take place, if really we must go so far. And I shall make up my mind to it as soon as I think it possible.It\'s against my own inclinations that I devoted myself to politics. I don\'t see anything in politics, anyway, but a means to an end. Some people suppose it would deeply grieve me to give up the activity that occupies me at this moment. They are deeply mistaken, for the finest day of my life will be that on which I leave politics behind me, with its griefs and torments. When the war\'s over, and I have the sense of having accomplished my duties, I shall retire. Then I would like to devote five or ten years to clarifying my thought and setting it down on paper. Wars pass by. The only things that exist are the works of human genius.If somebody else had one day been found to accomplish the work to which I\'ve devoted myself, I would never have entered on the path of politics. I\'d have chosen the arts or philosophy. The care I feel for the existence of the German people compelled me to this activity. It\'s only when the conditions for living are assured that culture can blossom.","The people in their overwhelming majority are so feminine by nature and attitude that sober reasoning determines their thoughts and actions far less than emotion and feeling.And this sentiment is not complicated, but very simple and all of a piece. It does not have multiple shadings; it has a positive and a negative; love or hate, right or wrong, truth or lie, never half this way and half that way, never partially, or that kind of thing.","No fue por casualidad por lo que el hombre domin\xf3 m\xe1s f\xe1cilmente la peste que la tuberculosis. La una viene en olas violentas de muerte, arrasando la Humanidad; la otra, en cambio, se desliza lentamente; una induce al terror, la otra a una creciente indiferencia. Consecuencia l\xf3gica fue que el hombre afrontase la primera con todo el m\xe1ximo de sus energ\xedas, en tanto que se empe\xf1\xf3 en combatir la tuberculosis vali\xe9ndose solamente de medios d\xe9biles.

All nations whose statesmen have signed this pact will sooner or later become the victims of the demonic spirits they have summoned. Let there be no doubt that National Socialist Germany will wage this fight for as long as it takes for this historic turn of events to come about here, too, and this will happen still this year.No power on earth will make us weak at heart. They have destroyed so many of our beautiful, magnificent, and sacred things that there remains only one mission in our lives: to create a state that will rebuild what they have destroyed. Therefore, it is our duty to preserve the freedom of the German nation for the future and not allow German manpower to be abducted to Siberia, but to deploy it for the rebuilding and dedicate it to the service of our own Volk. They have taught us so many horrible things that there is no more horror for us. What the homeland must endure is dreadful, what the front must accomplish is superhuman. Yet when, in the face of such pain, a whole nation proves itself as reliable as the German Volk, then Providence cannot and will not deny its right to live in the end. As always in history, it will reward its steadfastness with the prize of earthly existence. Since so many of our possessions have been destroyed, this can only reinforce us in our fanatical determination to see our enemies a thousand times over as what they truly are: destroyers of an eternal civilization and annihilators of mankind! And out of this hatred will grow a sacred will: to oppose these annihilators of our existence with all the strength God has given us and defeat them in the end.Adolf Hitler - proclamation to the German Folk Fuhrer Headquarters, February 24, 1945","in certain circles honesty is taken as an index of stupidity.","As soon as the Jews were allowed to stick their noses out of the ghetto, the sense of honour and loyalty in trade began to melt away. In fact, Judaism, this form of mental depravation that must at all costs be abolished, has made the fixing of prices depend on the laws of supply and demand factors, that is to say, which have nothing to do with the intrinsic value of an article. By creating the system of caveat emptor, the Jew has established a juridical basis for his rogueries. And thus it is that during the last two centuries, and with rare exceptions, our commerce has been dragged down to such a level that it has become absolutely necessary to apply a remedy. One first condition is necessary: to do away with the Jews.","In the thirteen years of my struggle for Germany, I have had to put up with so much persecutions and personal attacks that I gradually really learned to put the great cause, which I serve, above the miserable own self.Letter of November 16, 1932 to v. Papen","What stood before my eyes was from the first day on a thousand times more than to become a state minister. I wanted to become the destroyer of Marxism: I will solve this task! And if I solve it, then the title of state minister would be ridiculous for me.Speech of March 27, 1924 in Munich","For the future it will, I think, be essential to introduce a threeyear period of military service ; only by so doing can we ensure efficiency in the handling of new technical weapons. A threeyear period will be a great advantage to those who later propose to adopt a learned profession, for it will give them ample time to forget all the muck that was jammed into their heads at school; they will have time to discard everything which will not be of future use to them, and that, in itself, is most valuable. Everybody, for example, learns two or three foreign languages, which is a complete waste of time. The little one learns is not of the slightest use when one goes abroad. Everybody, I agree, should receive a basic education. But the whole method of instruction in secondary and higher schools is just so much nonsense. Instead of receiving a sound basic education, the student finds his head crammed with a mass of useless learning, and in the end is still ill-equipped to face life. Lucky are those who have the happy knack of being able to forget most of what they have been taught. Those who cannot forget are ripe to become professors\u2014a race apart. And that is not intended as a compliment!","In the years immediately following our assumption of power many people were of the opinion that inflation was inevitable. The only ones who appreciated our policy were the workmen. For years I had been telling them : Your wages can only rise in proportion to the increase in your productivity.The less money a man has, the more common-sense he shows. The richest people are the least reasonable, and some are so stupid that they become misers! This tendency is generally corrected by the sons, who fling the money away with both hands. For this reason we must see to it that the gaming-tables are not done away with; casinos are marvellous institutions, and we must say to everyone with too much money : Gome on, you people, come and gamble!The whole of life is one perpetual hazard, and birth is the greatest hazard of them all. Every parent knows that his son is the most intelligent baby born, even after the first week : one tells that, of course, from the child\'s weight.","Cuanto m\xe1s taca\xf1o fuera, hoy en d\xeda, en esp\xedritu y saber, un tal mercader de cueros, cuanto m\xe1s clara su propia intuici\xf3n le hiciera ver su triste figura, tanto m\xe1s alabar\xe1 un sistema que no le exige la fuerza y el genio de un gigante, sino que se contenta con la astucia de un alcaide y llega incluso a ver con mejores ojos esa especie de sabidur\xeda que la de Pericles.

Here nothing good is said of human nature as a whole and every institution, from the school to the government, is reviled. Whether religion and morals are concerned or the State and the social order, it is all the same; they are all scoffed at. When the young lad leaves school, at the age of fourteen, it would be difficult to say what are the most striking features of his character, incredible ignorance in so far as real knowledge is concerned or cynical impudence combined with an attitude towards morality which is really startling at so young an age.","Una de las peores pruebas de la decadencia de Alemania, ya antes de la guerra, era la casi total indiferencia general que se notaba con respecto a todo.

According to Raushning, Hitler then stopped his speech, abruptly saying: \\"I can\'t say anymore.","Nothing, which is great in this world, was given as a gift to man. Everything had to be bitterly, difficulty won in struggle.Speech of May 1, 1933 in Berlin","The reason why the ancient world was so pure, light and serene was that it knew nothing of the two great scourges : the pox and Christianity.Christianity is a prototype of Bolshevism: the mobilisation by the Jew of the masses of slaves with the object of undermining society. Thus one understands that the healthy elements of the Roman world were proof against this doctrine.Yet Rome to-day allows itself to reproach Bolshevism with having destroyed the Christian churches! As if Christianity hadn\'t behaved in the same way towards the pagan temples.","Yahudi\'nin ger\xe7ek gayesi hi\xe7bir zaman yaz\u0131n\u0131n tamam\u0131nda aranmamal\u0131d\u0131r.

The more uniformly the fighting will of a people is put into action, the greater will be the magnetic force of the movement and the more powerful the impetus of the blow. It is part of the genius of a leader to make adversaries of different fields appear as always belonging to one category only, because to weak and unstable characters, the knowledge that there are various enemies will lead only too easily to incipient doubts as to their own cause.  As soon as the wavering masses find themselves confronted with too many enemies, objectivity at once steps in, and the question is raised whether actually all the others are wrong and their own nation or their own movement alone is right.  Also, with this comes the first paralysis of their own strength. Therefore, a number of essentially different enemies must always be regarded as one in such a way that in the opinion of the mass of one\u2018s own adherents the war is being waged against one enemy alone. This strengthens the belief in one\u2018s own cause and increases one\u2018s bitterness against the attacker.","Ogni incrocio di due esseri di grado diverso d\xe0 come prodotto una via di mezzo tra i diversi livelli dei due genitori; star\xe0 pi\xf9 su dell\'elemento inferiore ma non sar\xe0 elevata quanto il superiore","Le predisposizioni profonde dei popoli determinano gli effetti dell\'influenza esterna. Ci\xf2 che conduce gli uni a crepare di fame, educa invece gli altri al duro lavoro","Aquello que de ordinario denominamos \\"opini\xf3n p\xfablica\\" se basa s\xf3lo m\xednimamente en la experiencia personal del individuo y en sus conocimientos; depende m\xe1s bien casi en su totalidad de la idea que el individuo se hace de las cosas a trav\xe9s de la llamada \\"informaci\xf3n p\xfablica\\", que es persistente y tenaz. Del mismo modo que el credo religioso resulta de la educaci\xf3n, al paso que el sentimiento religioso duerme en lo m\xe1s \xedntimo del ser, de la misma manera la opini\xf3n pol\xedtica de la masa es el resultado final del trabajo, a veces incre\xedblemente arduo e intenso, de la inteligencia humana. La prensa es el factor responsable de mayor volumen en el proceso de la \\"educaci\xf3n\\" pol\xedtica, a la cual en este caso se le asigna con propiedad el nombre de propaganda; la prensa se encarga ante todo de esta labor de \\"informaci\xf3n p\xfablica\\" y representa as\xed una especie de escuela para adultos, s\xf3lo que esa \\"instrucci\xf3n\\" no est\xe1 en manos del Estado, sino bajo las garras de elementos que en parte son de muy baja ralea. Precisamente en Viena tuve en mi juventud la mejor oportunidad de conocer a fondo a los propietarios y fabricantes espirituales de esa m\xe1quina de educaci\xf3n colectiva. En un principio deb\xed sorprenderme al darme cuenta del tiempo relativamente corto en que este pernicioso poder era capaz de crear un determinado ambiente de opini\xf3n, y esto incluso trat\xe1ndose de casos de una mixtificaci\xf3n completa de las aspiraciones y tendencias que, a no dudar, exist\xedan en el sentir de la comunidad. En el transcurso de pocos d\xedas, esa prensa sab\xeda hacer de un motivo insignificante una cuesti\xf3n de Estado notable e, inversamente, en igual tiempo, relegar al olvido general problemas vitales o, m\xe1s simplemente, sustraerlos a la memoria de las masas.","La suposici\xf3n de que todas las razas son, por sus caracter\xedsticas, iguales, puede ser seguida de una manera parecida a considerar a las naciones lleg\xe1ndose en escala descendente a afirmar id\xe9ntica cosa hasta de los mismos hombres. En esta forma, el mismo marxismo internacional no pasa de ser un punto de vista general del mundo \u2013 sostenido en verdad por espacio de muy largo tiempo \u2013 y llevado adelante por el jud\xedo Karl Marx a modo de credo pol\xedtico. De faltarle el apoyo de un proceso de envenenamiento semejante, el extraordinario \xe9xito pol\xedtico de estas doctrinas habr\xeda sido imposible. Karl Marx fue sencillamente, y en realidad, el \xfanico individuo entre millones que en el lodazal de un mundo corrompido descubri\xf3, con el ojo seguro del profeta, la ponzo\xf1a indispensable, extract\xe1ndola como por arte de magia en una soluci\xf3n concentrada a fin de acelerar la destrucci\xf3n de la existencia independiente de las naciones libres de esta Tierra. Y todo ello con el prop\xf3sito de servir a su propia raza.En este sentido puede decirse que la doctrina marxista constituye el ep\xedtome intelectual de las teor\xedas del mundo que prevalecen hoy en d\xeda.En esta parte del mundo la cultura humana y la civilizaci\xf3n est\xe1n indisolublemente ligadas a la presencia del elemento ario. Si ese elemento desapareciese o fuera vencido, el negro velo de un periodo de barbarie volver\xeda a descender sobre el mundo.Para todo aquel que contemple a este \xfaltimo con ojos de nacionalista, cualquier brecha abierta en la existencia de la civilizaci\xf3n humana merced a la destrucci\xf3n de la raza que la protege, ser\xe1 siempre el m\xe1s condenable de los cr\xedmenes. Quien ose poner la mano en la m\xe1s noble imagen de Dios, pecar\xe1 contra el bondadoso Creador de esta maravilla y contribuir\xe1 a su propia expulsi\xf3n del para\xedso.Todos sabemos que en un porvenir lejano, la humanidad deber\xe1 afrontar problemas cuya soluci\xf3n exigir\xe1 que una raza excelsa en grado superlativo, apoyada por las fuerzas de todo el planeta, asuma la direcci\xf3n del mundo. La organizaci\xf3n de una pol\xedtica mundial s\xf3lo podr\xe1 efectuarse, en todos los tiempos, mediante su enunciaci\xf3n definida y exacta; los prinicipios de un partido en formaci\xf3n son para \xe9ste lo que el dogma es para la religi\xf3n. Por consiguiente, as\xed como la organizaci\xf3n del partido marxista traza actualmente el camino hacia el internacionalismo, as\xed debe contar la pol\xedtica nacionalista con un instrumento que nos ofrezca una posibilidad de defenderla por la fuerza. \xc9ste es el objetivo que persigue el Partido Nacional Socialista Obrero Alem\xe1n.Advert\xed, pues, que me estaba reservada la particular misi\xf3n de extraer las ideas centrales de la masa informe de esta teor\xeda general del mundo, para remodelarlas y darles una forma m\xe1s o menos dogm\xe1tica, de modo que por su franqueza y claridad fuera capaz de unir s\xf3lidamente a cuantos la aprobasen. En otras palabras: el Partido Nacional Socialista Obrero Alem\xe1n se propone adaptar los principios esenciales de una teor\xeda racista del mundo a las posibilidades pr\xe1cticas que nos ofrecen los tiempos y el material humano actuales, para lograr el triunfo de aquella teor\xeda del mundo, triunfo que tendr\xe1 lugar cuando tales m\xe9todos hayan tornado posible la r\xedgida organizaci\xf3n de grandes masas.","Se uma doutrina que encerrasse mais inveracidade ao lado de id\xeantica brutalidade na propaganda, fosse oposta a social-democracia, triunfaria do mesmo modo, por mais \xe1spera que fosse a luta.","The differences between the various peoples should not prevent us from recognizing the community of race which unites them on a higher plane.","For we do not know what type of instinct Mr. Eden has for idealistic values. He has never revealed this. The company he keeps does not speak for this. Above all, the civilization of his country is not of a nature that could perhaps impress us. I do not even wish to speak of the man across the ocean.Their instinct for idealistic values is certainly less than ours. We have in all likelihood given the world more idealistic values than that society frequented by Mr. Eden. The same applies to the countries that have tied themselves to us.In part, they look back onto civilizations in comparison with which the civilization of the Anglo-Saxon island-country is truly infinitely young, not to say infantile.In regard to material values, I do believe that they indeed have a very fine instinct for this. But we also have it. There is, however, a difference: we will make sure, under all circumstances, that the material values of Europe will in the future benefit the European people instead of an extra continental, small, international clique of financiers. That is our unshakable and merciless decision.The people of Europe are not fighting so that, afterwards, a couple of folk can again come along with their \u201cfine instincts, pillage mankind, and leave behind millions of unemployed, only so that they can fill their safes.We had a good reason why we distanced ourselves from the gold standard.We wanted to eliminate one of the prerequisites for this type of economic outlook and enterprise. And this is certain: Europe will emerge from this war far more economically sound than before.For a great part of the continent which has previously been organized against Europe will now be put into the service of the European nations.Adolf Hitler \u2013 speech in the L\xf6wenbr\xe4ukeller Munich, November 8, 1942\u201d","\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0631\u062f\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639 \u0643\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0633\u060c \u0641\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0631\u0642 \u0645\u062b\u0644\u0647\u0627.","S\xf3 se pode lutar pelo que se ama, s\xf3 se pode amar o que se respeita e respeitar o que pelo menos se conhece.","Quando dico noi, intendo parlare di quelle centinaia di migliaia che hanno le nostre stesse aspirazioni","It is the custom in Germany for students to pass from one university to another during the course of their studies\u2014a custom, incidentally, which no other country has. But it would be false to assume that this variety in instruction is a safeguard afainst uniformity of outlook, for although the professors of the various universities fight among themselves, they are all, fundamentally and at heart, in complete agreement. I came to realise this clearly through my contacts with the economists. This must have been about 1929. At that time we published a paper on certain aspects of the economic problem. Immediately a whole company of national economists of all sorts, and from a variety of universities, joined forces and signed a circular in which they unaminously condemned our economic proposals. I made one attempt to have a serious discussion with one of the most renowned of them, and one who was regarded by his colleagues as a revolutionary in economic thought Zwiedineck. The results were disastrous!At the time the State had floated a loan of two million seven hundred thousand marks for the construction of a road. I told Zwiedineck that I regarded this way of financing a project as foolish in the extreme. The life of the road in question would be some fifteen years ; but the amortisation of the capital involved would continue for eighty years. What the Government was really doing was to evade an immediate financial obligation by transferring the charges to the men of the next generation and, indeed, of the generation after. I insisted that nothing could be more unsound, and that what the Government should really do was to take radical steps to reduce the rate of interest and thus to render capital more fluid.I next argued that the gold standard, the fixing of rates of exchange and so forth were shibboleths which I had never regarded and never would regard as weighty and immutable principles of economy. Money, to me, was simply a token of exchange for work done, and its value depended absolutely on the value of the work accomplished. Where money did not represent services rendered, I insisted, it had no value at all.Zwiedineck was horrified and very excited. Such ideas, he declared, would upset the accepted economic principles of the entire world, and the putting of them into practice would cause a breakdown of the world\'s political economy.When, later, after our assumption of power, I put my theories into practice, the economists were not in the least discountenanced, but calmly set to work to prove by scientific argument that my theories were, indeed, sound economy !","No hay medio al que no recurra un tal delincuente moral para alcanzar sus objetivos.
