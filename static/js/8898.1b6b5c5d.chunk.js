Commitment is an act, not a word.","To know what life is worth you have to risk it once in a while.","Life begins on the other side of despair.","Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.","There is only one day left, always starting over: it is given to us at dawn and taken away from us at dusk.","Sometimes the truth is too simple for intellectuals.","your judgement judges you and defines you","Man is what he wills himself to be.","We only become what we are by the radical and deep-seated refusal of that which others have made of us.","Life has no meaning the moment you lose the illusion of being eternal.","We make our own hell out of the people around us.","Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself. [It is a matter of choice, not chance.] Such is the first principle of existentialism.","Everything has been figured out, except how to live.","To choose not to choose is still to act.","We do not judge the people we love.","Commitment is an act, not a word.","In love, one and one are one.","I am. I am, I exist, I think, therefore I am; I am because I think, why do I think? I don\'t want to think any more, I am because I think that I don\'t want to be, I think that I . . . because . . . ugh!","Words are loaded pistols.","Because we can imagine, we are free.","A kiss without a moustache, they said then, is like an egg without salt; I will add to it: and it is like Good without Evil.","We are possessed by the things we possess. When I like an object, I always give it to someone. It isn\'t generosity-it\'s only because I want others to be enslaved by objects, not me.","In life man commits himself and draws his own portrait, outside of which there is nothing. No doubt this thought may seem harsh to someone who has not made a success of his life. But on the other hand, it helps people to understand that reality alone counts, and that dreams, expectations and hopes only serve to define a man as a broken dream, aborted hopes, and futile expectations.","Everything comes to us from others. To Be is to belong to someone.","I\'m going to smile, and my smile will sink down into your pupils, and heaven knows what it will become.","I felt myself in a solitude so frightful that I contemplated suicide. What held me back was the idea that no one, absolutely no one, would be moved by my death, that I would be even more alone in death than in life.","Ideas come in pairs and they contradict one another; their opposition is the principal engine of reflection.","I respect orders but I respect myself too and I do not obey foolish rules made especially to humiliate me.","Man is fully responsible for his nature and his choices.","Why do you keep maintaining your ideas are right if you can\'t prove them?","Nothingness haunts Being.","Once freedom lights its beacon in man\'s heart, the gods are powerless against him.","The best work is not what is most difficult for you; it is what you do best.","Death is a continuation of my life without me.","Once we know and are aware, we are responsible for our action and our inaction. We can do something about it or ignore it. Either way, we are still responsible.","Man can will nothing unless he has first understood that he must count on no one but himself; that he is alone, abandoned on earth in the midst of his infinite responsibilities, without help, with no other aim than the one he sets himself, with no other destiny than the one he forges for himself on this earth.","Life gave me everything I asked\\nIf all I asked was not a great deal, that\'s my problem!","It\'s quite an undertaking to start loving somebody.

I saw the library as a temple.","Once you hear the details of victory, it is hard to distinguish it from a defeat.","Three o\'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do.","He was free, free in every way, free to behave like a fool or a machine, free to accept, free to refuse, free to equivocate; to marry, to give up the game, to drag this death weight about with him for years to come. He could do what he liked, no one had the right to advise him, there would be for him no Good or Evil unless he thought them into being.","In wanting freedom we discover that it depends entirely on the freedom of others, and that the freedom of others depends on ours. . .

Humble, as much as you like, but not modest. Modesty is the virtue of the lukewarm.","Violence is good for those who have nothing to lose.","Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.","What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world-and defines himself afterward.","Hell is other people at breakfast.","God is dead. Let us not understand by this that he does not exist or even that he no longer exists. He is dead. He spoke to us and is silent. We no longer have anything but his cadaver.

Perhaps he was only a dream...God is dead.","Philosophy which does not help to illuminate the process of the liberation of the oppressed should be rejected.","There are two types of poor people, those who are poor together and those who are poor alone. The first are the true poor, the others are rich people out of luck.","Evil is the product of the ability of humans to make abstract that which is concrete.","When she is alone in the rooms I hear her humming to keep herself from thinking.","I am alone in the midst of these happy, reasonable voices. All these creatures spend their time explaining, realizing happily that they agree with each other. In Heaven\'s name, why is it so important to think the same things all together.","I think of death only with tranquility, as an end. I refuse to let death hamper life. Death must enter life only to define it.","Imagination is not an empirical or superadded power of consciousness, it is the whole of consciousness as it realizes its freedom.","I\'d come to realize that all our troubles spring from our failure to use plain, clear-cut language.","I want to leave, to go somewhere where I should be really in my place, where I would fit in . . . but my place is nowhere; I am unwanted.","I exist, that is all, and I find it nauseating.","Genius is what a man invents when he is looking for a way out.","I never could bear the idea of anyone\'s expecting something from me.

The adventure of living, hurtling toward death.","All I can do is make the best of what I am, become accustomed to it, evaluate the possibilities, and take advantage of them the best I can.","Man is not the sum of what he has already, but rather the sum of what he does not yet have, of what he could have.","I confused things with their names: that is belief.","We must act out passion before we can feel it.","Consciousness is a being the nature of which is to be conscious of the nothingness of its being.","It is only in our decisions that we are important.","As far as men go, it is not what they are that interests me, but what they can become.","One cannot become a saint when one works sixteen hours a day.","If you want to deserve Hell, you need only stay in bed. The world is iniquity; if you accept it, you are an accomplice, if you change it you are an executioner.","I have no religion, but if I were to choose one, it would be that of Shariati\'s.","The aim of language...is to communicate...to impart to others the results one has obtained...As I talk, I reveal the situation...I reveal it to myself and to others in order to change it.","Like all dreamers, I mistook disenchantment for truth.","My thought is me: that\'s why I can\'t stop. I exist because I think\u2026 and I can\'t stop myself from thinking. At this very moment - it\'s frightful - if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing. I am the one who pulls myself from the nothingness to which I aspire.","I do not believe in God; his existence has been disproved by Science. But in the concentration camp, I learned to believe in men.","It is meaningless that we are born, it is meaningless that we die.","Il n\'y a de r\xe9alit\xe9 que dans l\'action.

Maybe we don\'t love them because we aren\'t used to them, but if we saw them the way we saw our hands and arms maybe we\'d love them; the starfish must love each other better than we do.","What is meant here by saying that existence precedes essence? It means first of all, man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and, only afterwards, defines himself. If man, as the existentialist conceives him, is indefinable, it is because at first he is nothing. Only afterward will he be something, and he himself will have made what he will be.","I am going to outlive myself. Eat, sleep, sleep, eat. Exist slowly, softly, like these trees, like a puddle of water, like the red bench in the streetcar.","He walked on in silence, the solitary sound of his footsteps echoing in his head, as in a deserted street, at dawn. His solitude was so complete, beneath a lovely sky as mellow and serene as a good conscience, amid that busy throng, that he was amazed at his own existence; he must be somebody else\'s nightmare, and whoever it was would certainly awaken soon.","In football everything is complicated by the presence of the opposite team.","When we love animals and children too much, we love them at the expense of men.","Photographs are not ideas. They give us ideas.","It disturbs me no more to find men base, unjust, or selfish than to see apes mischievous, wolves savage, or the vulture ravenous.","Introspection is always retrospection","It is disgusting -- Why must we have bodies?","God is absence. God is the solitude of man.","The absurd man will not commit suicide; he wants to live, without relinquishing any of his certainty, without a future, without hope, without illusions \u2026 and without resignation either. He stares at death with passionate attention and this fascination liberates him. He experiences the \u201cdivine irresponsibility\u201d of the condemned man.","I exist. It is soft, so soft, so slow. And light: it seems as though it suspends in the air. It moves.","One of the chief motives of artistic creation is certainly the need of feeling that we are essential in relationship to the world.","We do not know what we want and yet we are responsible for what we are - that is the fact.","Politics is a science. You can demonstrate that you are right and that others are wrong.","The poor don\'t know that their function in life is to exercise our generosity.","You must be afraid, my son. That is how one becomes an honest citizen.","In a word, man must create his own essence: it is in throwing himself into the world, suffering there, struggling there, that he gradually defines himself.","If you die, I will lie down beside you and I will stay there until the end, without eating or drinking, you will rot in my arms and I will love you as carcass: for you love nothing if you do not love everything.","When the rich [and politically powerful] make war, it\'s the poor [and politically weak] who die.","She believed in nothing; only her skepticism kept her from being an atheist.","It\u2019s the well-behaved children that make the most formidable revolutionaries. They don\u2019t say a word, they don\u2019t hide under the table, they eat only one piece of chocolate at a time. But later on, they make society pay dearly.","We are now in a position to understand the anti-Semite. He is a man who is afraid. Not of the Jews, to be sure, but of himself, of his own consciousness, of his liberty, of his instincts, of his responsibilities, of solitariness, of change, of society, and of the world of everything except the Jews.","I am no longer sure of anything. If I satiate my desires, I sin but I deliver myself from them; if I refuse to satisfy them, they infect the whole soul.","That\u2019s what existence means: draining one\u2019s own self dry without the sense of thirst.","I have no need for good souls: an accomplice is what I wanted.","Naturally, in the course of my life I have made lots of mistakes, large and small, for one reason or another, but at the heart of it all, every time I made a mistake it was because I was not radical enough.","Several hours or several years make no difference once you have lost eternity.","Every human endeavor, however singular it seems, involves the whole human race.","Nothing happens while you live. The scenery changes, people come in and go out, that\'s all. There are no beginnings. Days are tacked on to days without rhyme or reason, an interminable, monotonous addition.","Something begins in order to end: an adventure doesn\'t let itself be extended it achieves significance only through its death.","Life is nothing until it is lived; but it is yours to make sense of, and the of it is nothing other than the sense you choose.","If I became a philosopher, if I have so keenly sought this fame for which I\'m still waiting, it\'s all been to seduce women basically.","Two people can form a community by excluding a third.","A lost battle is a battle one thinks one has lost.","I do not think therefore I am a moustache","People who live in society have learnt how to see themselves, in mirrors, as they appear to their friends. I have no friends: is that why my flesh is so naked?","What is boredom? It is when there is simultaneously too much and not enough.","Every age has its own poetry; in every age the circumstances of history choose a nation, a race, a class to take up the torch by creating situations that can be expressed or transcended only through poetry.","I am beginning to believe that nothing can ever be proved. These are honest hypotheses which take the facts into account: but I sense so definitely that they come from me, and that they are simply a way of unifying my own knowledge. Not a glimmer comes from Rollebon\'s side. Slow, lazy, sulky, the facts adapt themselves to the rigour of the order I wish to give them; but it remains outside of them. I have the feeling of doing a work of pure imagination.","There are two kinds of existentialist; first, those who are Christian...and on the other hand the atheistic existentialists, among whom...I class myself. What they have in common is that they think that existence precedes essence, or, if you prefer, that subjectivity must be the turning point.","[M]an is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, in other respect is free; because, once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does. The Existentialist does not believe in the power of passion. He will never agree that a sweeping passion is a ravaging torrent which fatally leads a man to certain acts and is therefore an excuse. He thinks that man is responsible for his passion.","When rich people fight wars with one another, poor people are the ones to die.","The more one is absorbed in fighting evil, the less one is tempted to place the good in question.","When one does nothing, one believes oneself responsible for everything.","Acting is a question of absorbing other people\'s personalities and adding some of your own experience.","I suppose it is out of laziness that the world is the same day after day. Today it seemed to want to change. And then anything, anything could happen.","I hate victims who respect their executioners.","I tell you in truth: all men are Prophets or else God does not exist.","Man is the being whose project it is to be God.","How can I, who was not able to retain my own past, hope to save that of another?","To read a poem in January is as lovely as to go for a walk in June","Our responsibility is much greater than we might have supposed, because it involves all mankind.","We cannot withdraw our cards from the game. Were we as silent and mute as stones, our very passivity would be an act.","Smooth and smiling faces everywhere, but ruin in their eyes.","I wanted pure love: foolishness; to love one another is to hate a common enemy: I will thus espouse your hatred. I wanted Good: nonsense; on this earth and in these times, Good and Bad are inseparable: I accept to be evil in order to become good.","One is still what one is going to cease to be and already what one is going to become. One lives one\'s death, one dies one\'s life.","When you live alone you no longer know what it is to tell a story: the plausible disappears at the same time as the friends. You let events flow by too: you suddenly see people appear who speak and then go away; you plunge into stories of which you can\'t make head or tail: you\'d make a terrible witness.","[Lost of the absolute] is in this sense that \'\'I no longer know what to do with my life\\" must be understood. Critics have been mistaken about the meaning of this phrase, seeing in it a cry of despair as in Simone de Beauvoir\'s \\"I have been cheated.\\" When she uses this word it is to indicate that she claims from life an absolute which she cannot find there.","Uncalled-for aggression arouses the hatred of the civilian population.","I will take it all: tongs, molten lead, prongs, garrotes, all that burns, all that tears, I want to truly suffer. Better one hundred bites, better the whip, vitriol, than this suffering in the head, this ghost of suffering which grazes and caresses and never hurts enough.","One does not adopt a new idea, one slips into it.","There were days when you peered into yourself, into the secret places of your heart, and what you saw there made you faint with horror. And then, next day, you didn\'t know what to make of it,you couldn\'t interpret the horror you had glimpsed the day before. Yes, you know what evil costs.","Man must be invented each day","Intellectuals cannot be good revolutionaries; they are just good enough to be assassins.","As for the square at Meknes, where I used to go every day, it\'s even simpler: I do not see it at all anymore. All that remains is the vague feeling that it was charming, and these five words that are indivisibly bound together: a charming square at Meknes. ... I don\'t see anything any more: I can search the past in vain, I can only find these scraps of images and I am not sure what they represent, whether they are memories or just fiction.","It is certain that we cannot escape anguish, for we are anguish.","A madman\'s ravings are absurd in relation to the situation in which he finds himself, but not in relation to his madness.","A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.","The viable jewels of life remain untouched when man forgets his vocation of searching for the truth of his existence.","What then did you expect when you unbound the gag that muted those black mouths? That they would chant your praises? Did you think that when those heads that our fathers had forcibly bowed down to the ground were raised again, you would find adoration in their eyes?","No finite point has meaning without an infinite reference point.","The coward makes himself cowardly, the hero makes himself heroic.","One can ask why the I has to appear in the cogito {Descartes\u2019 argument \u201cI think therefore I am.}, since the cogito, if used rightly, is the awareness of pure consciousness, not directed at any fact or action. In fact the I is not necessary here, since it is never united directly to consciousness. One can even imagine a pure and self-aware consciousness which thinks of itself as impersonal spontaneity.","To keep hope alive one must, in spite of all mistakes, horrors, and crimes, recognize the obvious superiority of the socialist camp.","I can receive nothing more from these tragic solitudes than a little empty purity.","The consciousness that says \'I am\' is not the consciousness that thinks.","This is what I thought: for the most banal even to become an adventure, you must (and this is enough) begin to recount it. This is what fools people: a man is always a teller of tales, he sees everything that happens to him through them; and he tries to live his own life as if he were telling a story. But you have to choose: live or tell.","Man is condemned to be free","Nothingness lies coiled in the heart of being - like a worm.","It would be much better if I could only stop thinking. Thoughts are the dullest things. Duller than flesh. They stretch out and there\'s no end to them and they leave a funny taste in the mouth. Then there are words, inside the thoughts, unfinished words, a sketchy sentence which constantly returns...It goes, it goes ... and there\'s no end to it. It\'s worse than the rest because I feel responsible and have complicity in it. For example, this sort of painful rumination: I exist, I am the one who keeps it up. I.","Because the Nazi venom worked its way even into our thoughts, every accurate thought was a conquest; because an all-powerful police sought to force us into silence every word became as precious as a declaration of principle; because we were persecuted, each of our gestures carried the weight of a commitment.","As for me, I am mean: that means that I need the suffering of others to exist. A flame. A flame in their hearts. When I am all alone, I am extinguished.","Atheism is a cruel long term business, and I have gone through it to the end.","For the artist, the color, the bouquet, the tinkling of the spoon on the saucer, are things in the highest degree. He stops at the quality of the sound or the form. He returns to it constantly and is enchanted with it.","All that I know about my life, it seems, I have learned in books.","Yes, I am so free. And what a superb absence is my soul.","I wanted my own words. But the ones I use have dragged through I don\'t know how many consciences.","One should commit no stupidity twice, the variety of choice is, in the end, large enough.","This desire [to write] is rather strange all the same and is not without a certain \\"cracked\\" quality.","Acting is happy agony.","I have such a desire to sleep and am so much behind my sleep. A good night, one good night and all this nonsense will be swept away.","Handing over a bank note is enough to make a bicycle belong to me, but my entire life is needed to realize this possession.","Let it crumble! Let the rocks revile me and flowers wilt at my coming. Your whole universe is not enough to prove me wrong. You are the king of gods, king of stones and stars, king of the waves of the sea. But you are not the king of man.","We will not go to Heaven,Goetz, and even if we both entered it, we would not have eyes to see each other, nor hands to touch each other. Up there, God gets all the attention.... We can only love on this earth and against God.","I think that is the big danger in keeping a diary: you exaggerate everything.","I think there is an enormous diference between speaking and writing. One rereads what one writes. But one might read it slowly or quickly. In other words, you do not know how long you will have to spend deliberating over a sentence. ... But if I listen to a tape recorder, the listening time is determined by the speed at which the tape turns and not by my own needs.","I found the human heart empty and insipid everywhere except in books.","For the moment, the jazz is playing; there is no melody, just notes, a myriad tiny tremors. The notes know no rest, an inflexibleorder gives birth to them then destroys them, without ever leaving them the chance to recuperate and exist for themselves.... I would like to hole them back, but I know that, if I succeeded in stooping one, there would only remain in may hand a corrupt and languishing sound. I must accept their death; I must even want that death: I know of few more bitter or intense impressions.","But [your crime] will be there, one hundred times denied, always there, dragging itself behind you. Then you will finally know that you have committed your life with one throw of the die, once and for all, and there is nothing you can do but tug our crime along until your death. Such is the law, just and unjust, of repentance. Then we will see what will become of your young pride.","A man is always a teller of tales, he lives surrounded by his stories and the stories of others, he sees everything that happens to him through them; and he tries to live his life as if he were recounting it.","Being is. Being is in-itself. Being is what it is.","There are photographers who push for war because they make stories. They search for a Chinese who has a more Chinese are than the others and they end up finding one. They have him take a typically Chinese pose and surround him with chinoiseries. What have they captured on their film? A Chinese? Definitely not: the idea of the Chinese.","So that is what hell is. I would never have believed it. You remember: the fire and brimstone, the torture. Ah! the farce. There is no need for torture: Hell is other people.","When I can\'t see myself in the mirror, I can\'t even feel myself, and I begin to wonder if I exist at all.","It is therefore senseless to think of complaining since nothing foreign has decided what we feel, what we live, or what we are.","With despair, true optimism begins: the optimism of the man who expects nothing, who knows he has no rights and nothing coming to him, who rejoices in counting on himself alone and in acting alone for the good of all.","Take [St\xe9phane] Mallarme. I hold him to be the greatest of French poets, and I have taken some time to understand him !","What I ask of [the writer] is not to ignore the reality and the fundamental problems that exist. The world\'s hunger, the atomic threat, the alienation of man, I am astonished that they do not color all our literature.","That God does not exist, I cannot deny, That my whole being cries out for God I cannot forget.","You are -- your life, and nothing else.","You must be like me; you must suffer in rhythm.","Generosity is nothing else than a craze to possess. All which I abandon, all which I give, I enjoy in a higher manner through the fact that I give it away. To give is to enjoy possessively the object which one gives.","You take souls for vegetables.... The gardener can decide what will become of his carrots but no one can choose the good of others for them.","Objects should not touch because they are not alive. You use them, put them back in place, you live among them: they are useful, nothing more. But they touch me, it is unbearable. I am afraid of being in contact with them as though they were living beasts.","Don\'t you feel the same way? When I cannot see myself, even though I touch myself, I wonder if I really exist.","I construct my memories with my present. I am lost, abandoned in the present. I try in vain to rejoin the past: I cannot escape.","So much torture, bloodshed, deceit. You cannot make your young people practice torture twenty-four hours a day and not expect to pay a price for it.","Man is abandoned on earth in the midst of his infinite responsibilities, without help, with no aim but what he sets himself.","I had realized in the meantime that action too has its difficulties, and that one can also be led to it by neurosis. We are not saved by politics any more than by literature.","There is no human nature, since there is no god to conceive it.","What I regretted in La Nausee was not to have put myself completely into the thing. I remained outside my hero\'s disease, protected by my neurosis which, through writing, gave me happiness.","It is always more valuable to report the truth.","Thus it amounts to the same thing whether one gets drunk alone or is a leader of nations.","Philosophy appears to some people as a homogenous milieu: there thoughts are born and die, there systems are built, and there, in turn, they collapse. Others take Philosophy for a specific attitude which we can freely adopt at will. Still others see it as a determined segment of culture. In our view Philosophy does not exist.","We will freedom for freedom\u2019s sake, in and through particular circumstances. And in thus willing freedom, we discover that it depends entirely upon the freedom of others and that the freedom of others depends upon our own. Obviously, freedom as the definition of a man does not depend upon others, but as soon as there is a commitment, I am obliged to will the liberty of others at the same time as my own. I cannot make liberty my aim unless I make that of others equally my aim.","To think new thoughts you have to break the bones in your head","There is a universe behind and before him. And the day is approaching when closing the last book on the last shelf on the far left; he will say to himself, \\"now what?","Perhaps its inevitable, perhaps one has to choose between being nothing at all and impersonating what one is.","I needed to justify my existence, and I had made an absolute of literature. It took me thirty years to get rid of this state of mind.","Everything that exists is born for no reason, carries on living through weakness, and dies by accident","Is there really nothing, nothing left of me?","I was not the one to invent lies: they were created in a society divided by class and each of us inherited lies when we were born. It is not by refusing to lie that we will abolish lies: it is by eradicating class by any means necessary.","You know how much I admire Che Guevara. In fact, I believe that the man was not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age: as a fighter and as a man, as a\\n theoretician who was able to further the cause of revolution by drawing his theories from his personal experience in battle.","I exist. It\'s sweet, so sweet, so slow. And light: you\'d think it floated all by itself. It stirs. It brushes by me, melts and vanishes. Gently, gently. There is bubbling water in my mouth. I swallow. It slides down my throat, it caresses me \u2014 and now it comes up again into my mouth. For ever I shall have a little pool of whitish water in my mouth - lying low - grazing my tongue. And this pool is still me. And the tongue. And the throat is me.","I said to myself, \'I want to die decently\'.","If I relegate impossible Salvation to the prop room, what remains? A whole man, composed of all men and as good as all of them and no better than any.","I have crossed the seas, I have left cities behind me, and I have followed the source of rivers towards their source or plunged into forests, always making for other cities. I have had women, I have fought with men ; and I could never turn back any more than a record can spin in reverse. And all that was leading me where ? To this very moment.","Fear? If I have gained anything by damning myself, it is that I no longer have anything to fear.","It is no longer possible to escape men. Farewell to the monsters, farewell to the saints. Farewell to pride. All that is left is men.","A man is involved in life, leaves his impress on it, and outside of that there is nothing.","My thought is me: that is why I cannot stop thinking. I exist because I think I cannot keep from thinking.","An individual chooses and makes himself.","To choose this or that is to affirm at the same time the value of what we choose, because we can never choose evil. We always choose the good, and nothing can be good for us without being\\n good for all.","I am finishing a biography of [Gustave] Flaubert. Because he is the opposite of what I am. One needs to rub up against argument.","This is the basis for the joy of love when there is joy; we feel that our existence is justified.","Be quiet! Anyone can spit in my face, and call me a criminal and a prostitute. But no one has the right to judge my remorse.","A Soviet citizen, an official writer, once said to me: \\"The day when Communism (that is, well-being for everyone) reigns, man\'s tragedy will begin: his finitude.\\"","The world would get along very well without literature. It would get along even better without man.","Better a good journalist than a poor assassin.","If I did not publish this autobiography [Les Mots] sooner and in its most radical form, it is because I considered it exaggerated.","It answers the question that was tormenting you: my love, you are not \'one thing in my life\' - not even the most important - because my life no longer belongs to me because...you are always me.","What\'s done at night belongs to the night. In the daytime you don\'t talk about it.","There it is: I am gently slipping into the water\'s depths, towards fear.","I committed the first crime by creating men as mortals. After that, what more could you do, you the murderers? Come on; they already had death in them: at most you simply hastened things a little.","The plight of modern man is that he is condemmed to be free.","Time is too large, it can\'t be filled up. Everything you plunge into it is stretched and disintegrates.","And I too wanted to be. That is all I wanted; and this is the last word. At the bottom of all these attempts which seemed without bounds, I find the same desire again: to drive existence out of me, to rid the passing moments of their fat, to twist them, dry them, purify myself, harden myself, to give back at last the sharp, precise sound of a saxophone note. That could even make an apologue: there was a poor man who got in the wrong world.","All I want is\' - and he uttered the final words through clenched teeth and with a sort of shame - \'to retain my freedom.\' I should myself have thought,\' said Jacques, \'that freedom consisted in frankly confronting situations into which one had deliberately entered, and accepting all one\'s responsibilities. But that, no doubt, is not your view.","There is no salvation anywhere. The idea of salvation implies the idea of an absolute.","Absurd, irreducible; nothing \u2014 not even a profound and secret delirium of nature \u2014 could explain it. Obviously I did not know everything, I had not seen the seeds sprout, or the tree grow. But faced with this great wrinkled paw, neither ignorance nor knowledge was important: the world of explanations and reasons is not the world of existence. A circle is not absurd, it is clearly explained by the rotation of a straight segment around one of its extremities. But neither does a circle exist. This root, on the other hand, existed in such a way that I could not explain it.","Everything is gratuitous, this garden, this city and myself. When you suddenly realize it, it makes you feel sick and everything begins to drift . . . that\'s nausea.","The sun is not ridiculous, quite the contrary. On everything I like, on the rust of the construction girders, on the rotten boards of the fence, a miserly, uncertain light falls, like the look you give, after a sleepless night, on decisions made with enthusiasm the day before, on pages you have written in one spurt without crossing out a word.","The lad who dreams of being a boxing champion or an admiral chooses reality. If the writer chooses the imaginary, he confuses the two.","As if there could be true stories: things happen in one way, and we retell them in the opposite way.","Outside nature, against nature, without excuse, beyond remedy, except what remedy I find within myself.","I am not virtuous. Our sons will be if we shed enough blood to give them the right to be.","I am not recommending \\"popular\\" literature which aims at the lowest.","The more absurd life is, the more insupportable death is.","If literature isn\'t everything, it\'s not worth a single hour of someone\'s trouble.","Nicias, do you think you can erase with good deeds the wrongs you committed against your mother? What good deed will ever reach her? Her soul is a scorching noon time, without a single breath of a breeze, nothing moves, nothing changes, nothing lives there; a great emaciated sun, an immobile sun eternally consumes her.","If you begin by saying, \'Thou shalt not lie,\' there is no longer any possibility of political action.","If a Jew is fascinated by Christians it is not because of their virtues, which he values little, but because they represent anonymity, humanity without race.","Originally, poetry creates the myth, while the prose-writer draws its portrait.","it was odd, he thought, that a man could hate himself as though he were someone else.","I discovered suddenly that alienation, exploitation of man by man, under-nourishment, relegated to the background metaphysical evil which is a luxury.","When one loves animals and children too much, one loves them against human beings.","Neither sex, without some fertilization of the complimentary characters of the other, is capable of the highest reaches of human endeavor.","For an occurrence to become an adventure, it is necessary and sufficient for one to recount it.","The existentialist says at once that man is anguish.","Un homme n\'est rien d\'autre qu\'une se  rie d\'entreprises. A man is no other than a series of undertakings.","L\'homme est condamne   a\'   e\\"  tre libre. Man is condemned to be free.","Freedom is existence, and in it existence precedes essence.","The writer is committed when he plunges to the very depths of himself with the intent to disclose, not his individuality, but his person in the complex society that conditions and supports him.","Your scare me rather. My reflection in the glass never did that; of course, I knew it so well. Like something I had tamed...I\'m going to smile, and my smile will sink down into your pupils, and heaven knows what it will become.","For the time being I have seen enough of living things, of dogs, of men, of all flabby masses which move spontaneously.","A writer who takes political, social or literary positions must act only with the means that are his. These means are the written words.","I have seen children dying of hunger. Over against a dying child La Nausee cannot act as a counterweight.","That is exactly the writer\'s problem. What does literature stand for in a hungry world?","Respectable society believed in God in order to avoid having to speak about him.","Men equally honest, equally devoted to their fatherland, are momentarily separated by different conceptions of their duty.","She suffers as a miser. She must be miserly with her pleasures, as well. I wonder if sometimes she doesn\'t wish she were free of this monotonous sorrow, of these mutterings which start as soon as she stops singing, if she doesn\'t wish to suffer once and for all, to drown herself in despair. In any case, it would be impossible for her: she is bound.","Existence is an imperfection.","Like morality, literature needs to be universal. So that the writer must put himself on the side of the majority, of the two billion starving, if he wishes to be able to speak to all and be read by all. Failing that, he is at the service of a privileged class and, like it, an exploiter.","I wanted the moments of my life to follow and order themselves like those of a life remembered. You might as well try and catch time by the tail.","Torture is senseless violence, born in fear... torture costs human lives but does not save them. We would almost be too lucky if these crimes were the work of savages: the truth is that torture makes torturers.","There is no love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving.","I am responsible for everything... except my very responsibility.","He is always becoming, and if it were not for the contingency of death, he would never end.","Better to have beasts that let themselves be killed than men who run away.","The universe remains dark. We are animals struck by catastrophe.","It is better; heavier, crueler. The mouth you wear for hell.","Who can exhaust a man? Who knows a man\'s resources?","So long as one believes in God, one has the right to do the Good in order to be moral.","The characteristic of every neurosis is to represent itself as natural.","What is not possible is not to choose.","Ha! to forget. How childish! I feel you in my bones. Your silence screams in my ears. You may nail your mouth shut, you may cut out your tongue, can you keep yourself from existing? Will you stop your thoughts.","I maintain that inversion is the effect of neither a prenatal choice nor an endocrinal malformation nor even the passive and determined result of complexes. It is an outlet that a child discovers when he is suffocating.","To whomever gives a kiss or a blow\\nRender a kiss or blow\\nBut to whomever gives when you are unable to return\\nOffer all the hatred in your heart\\nFor you were slaves and he enslaves you","It is enough that one man hate another for hate to gain, little by little, all mankind.","To be responsible is to be the uncontested author of an event or thing.","At times discreetly, at times disgustingly, I yielded to the most fatal temptation whenever I could no longer bear it: as a result of impatience, Orpheus lost Eurydice; as a result of impatience, I lost myself.","I have nothing but contempt for you idiotic chosen ones who have the heart to rejoice when there are the damned in Hell and the poor on earth; as for me, I am on the side of men and I will not leave it.","Anything, anything would be better than this agony of mind, this creeping pain that gnaws and fumbles and caresses one and never hurts quite enough.","I wrote in Les Mots that \\"I have often thought against myself.\\" That sentence has not been\\nunderstood either. Critics have seen in it a confession of masochism. But that is how one\\nshould think: revolting against everything \\"inculcated\'\' that one may have within oneself.","Criticism often takes from the tree caterpillars and blossoms together.","Words There is no good father, that\'s the rule. Don\'t lay the blame on men but on the bond of paternity, which is rotten. To beget children, nothing better; to have them, what iniquity!","I do not understand! I understand nothing! I cannot understand nor do I want to understand! I want to believe! To Believe!","What never vary are the necessities of being in the world, of having to labor and to die there.","Listen to me: a family man is never a real family man. An assassin is never entirely assassin. They play a role, you understand. While a dead man, he is really dead. To be or not to be, right?","The real nature of the present revealed itself: it was what exists, all that was not present did not exist.","Hell is for other people.","I entered the Communist Party because its cause was just and I will leave it when it ceases to be just.","She smiled and said with an ecstatic air: \\"It shines like a little diamond\\", \\"What does?\\" \\"This moment. It is round, it hangs in empty space like a little diamond; I am eternal.","In order to make myself recognized by the Other, I must risk my own life. To risk one\'s life, in fact, is to reveal oneself as not-bound to the objective form or to any determined existence\\n \u2014 as not-bound to life.","I have changed as everyone changes: within a permanency.","A man who is free is like a mangy sheep in a herd. He will contaminate my entire kingdom and ruin my work.","Man\'s existence precedes his essence","I admire [Samuel] Beckett, but I am totally against him. He seeks no improvement.","In Guinea I could read [Franz] Kafka. I re-discover in him my own discomfort.","I grow warm, I begin to feel happy. There is nothing extraordinary in this, it is a small happiness of Nausea: it spreads at the bottom of the viscous puddle, at the bottom of out time - the time of purple suspenders, and broken chair seats; it is made of white, soft instants, spreading at the edge, like an oil stain. No sooner than born, it is already old, it seems as though I have known it for twenty years.","As long as the writer cannot write for the two billion men who are hungry, he will be oppressed by a feeling of malaise.","[St\xe9phane Mallarm\xe9] theory of the hermetic is a mistake, but he can be only difficult to read when he has difficult things to say.","It\'s just what people do when they\'re getting old, when they\'re sick of themselves and their life; they think of money and take care of themselves.","What do I care about Jupiter? Justice is a human issue, and I do not need a god to teach it to me.","But I must finally realize that I am subject to these sudden transformations. The thing is that I rarely think; a crowd of small metamorphoses accumulate in me without my noticing it, and then, one fine day, a veritable revolution takes place.","I am not asking for sensational revelations, but I would like to sense the meaning of that minute, to feel it\'s urgency.","Then I realized what separated us: what I thought about him could not reach him; it was psychology, the kind they write about in books. But his judgment went through me like a sword and questioned my very right to exist. And it was true, I had always realized it; I hadn\'t the right to exist. I had appeared by chance, I existed like a stone, a plant or a microbe. My life put out feelers towards small pleasures in every direction. Sometimes it sent out vague signals; at other times I felt nothing more than a harmless buzzing.","The revolution you dream of is not ours. You don\'t want to change the world; you want to blow it up.","A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution.","It is too early to love. We will buy the right to do so by shedding blood.","emotion is first of all and in principle an accident","I am alone in this white, garden-rimmed street. Alone and free. But this freedom is rather like death.","When the rich wage war, it\'s the poor who die.","From the period when I wrote La Nausea I wanted to create a morality. My evolution consists in my no longer dreaming of doing so.","What I see is teeming cohesion, contained dispersal... For him, to sculpt is to take the fat off space.","One always dies too soon or too late. And yet, life is there, finished: the line is drawn, and it must all be added up. You are nothing other than your life.","So it comes to this; one doesn\u2019t need rest. Why bother about sleep if one isn\u2019t sleepy? That stands to reason, doesn\u2019t it? Wait a minute, there\u2019s a snag somewhere; something disagreeable. Why, now, should it be disagreeable? \u2026Ah, I see; it\u2019s life without a break.","I clung to nothing, in a way I was calm. But it was a horrible calm\u2014because of my body; my body, I saw with its eyes, I heard with its ears, but it was no longer me; it sweated and trembled by itself and I didn\u2019t recognize it any more.","Existence is prior to essence.","Ah! yes, I know: those who see me rarely trust my word: I must look too intelligent to keep it.","That of War and Peace or of Almagestes. All are satisfactory. The only criterion of a work\\nis its validity: that it should grip and that it should last.","[Andre] Gide can say it to me: it is a writer\'s morality only addressed to a few privileged\\npeople. For that reason it no longer interests me.","Existence is not something which lets itself be thought of form a distance; it must invade you suddenly, master you, weigh heavily on your heart like a great motionless beast - or else there is nothing at all.","Existence precedes and rules essence.","The public, too, has to make an effort in order to understand the writer who, though he renounce complacent obscurity, cannot always express his new-hidden thoughts lucidly and according to accepted models.","You see, I\'m fond of teasing, it\'s a second nature with me\u2014and I\'m used to teasing myself. Plaguing myself, if you prefer; I don\'t tease nicely.","First all men must be able to become men by the improvement of their conditions of existence, so that a universal morality can be created. If I begin by saying to them: \\"Thou\\nshalt not lie,\\" there is no longer any possibility of political action. What matters first is the liberation of man.","For forty years I was conscripted by the absolute, the neurosis. The absolute is gone. There remain countless tasks among which literature is in no way privileged.","I have always been an optimist, perhaps even too much.","I must be without remorse or regrets as I am without excuse; for from the instant of my upsurge into being, I carry the weight of the world by myself alone without help, engaged in a world for which I bear the whole responsibility without being able, whatever I do, to tear myself away from this responsibility for an instant.","I am myself and I am here.","We do not wish to say only that a man is responsible for his own individuality, but that he is responsible for that of all men.","Some of these days, Oh, you\'ll miss me honey","Do you think I can read [Alain] Robbe-Grillet in an underdeveloped country? He does not feel himself maimed.","All-powerful god, who am I but the fear that I inspire in others?","Love or hatred calls for self-surrender. He cuts a fine figure, the warm-blooded, prosperous man, solidly entrenched in his well-being, who one fine day surrenders all to love\u2014or to hatred; himself, his house, his land, his memories.","You see, the contemporary writer must write through his intimations of unease, while trying to elucidate them.","The For-itself, in fact, is nothing but the pure nihilation of the In-itself; it is like a hole of being at the heart of Being.","I have always been happy. Even if I had been more honest with regard to myself at that moment I should still have written La Nausee.","Things are entirely what they appear to be and behind them... there is nothing.","Thrown into the atmosphere of action [in 1954], I suddenly understood the kind of neurosis that dominated all my previous work. I had not been able to recognize it before: I was inside. Simone de Beauvoir had guessed these reasons before I did.","To eat is to appropriate by destruction.","In Les Mots I explain the origin of my madness, of my neurosis. This analysis may help the young who dream of writing.","In a country lacking leaders, in Africa, for instance, how could a native educated in Europe refuse to become a professor, even at the price of his literary vocation?","One could only damage oneself through the harm one did to others. One could never get directly at oneself.","This then is the age of reason.","Abjection is a methodological conversion, like Cartesian doubt and Husserlian epoche: it establishes the world as a closed system which consciousness regards from without, in the manner of divine understanding.","Absurd, irreducible; nothing--not even a profound and secret delirium of nature--could explain [a tree root].","Happiness has to be installed in each person as a state of affairs completely cut off from the process that brought it about and, in particular, from the real situation. Man has to be affected with happiness. It is a tonality given to him. Contradiction: if one does take care to give him happiness, it is because he is a free creature--but in order to give it to him, one turns him into an object.","To love is never just to love since it is also to will to love, and ... to love in spite of oneself, to allow oneself to be overcome by one\'s love.","In the nineteenth century one had to give all sorts of guarantees and lead an exemplary life in order to cleanse oneself in the eyes of the bourgeois of the sin of writing, for literature is, in essence, heresy. The situation has not changed except that it is now the Communists, that is, the qualified representatives of the proletariat, who as a matter of principle regard the writer as suspect.","My eyes feel all soft, all soft as flesh. I\'m going to sleep.","I\u2019ve dropped out of their hearts like a little sparrow fallen from its nest. So gather me up, dear, fold me to your heart \u2013 and you\u2019ll see how nice I can be.","For common minds have an ugly ability to perceive in the deepest and richest saying nothing but their own everyday opinion.","In any case, if you ever leave me with a handsome man, do not tell me that you trust me because, let me warn you: that is not what will prevent me from deceiving you, if I want to. On the contrary.","God is the solitude of men. There was only me: I alone decided to commit Evil; alone, I invented Good. I am the one who cheated, I am the one who performed miracles, I am the one accusing myself today, I alone can absolve myself; me, the man.","Heroism is not to be won at the point of a pen.","The painful secret of gods and kings is that men are free, Aegistheus. You know it and they do not.","It is not a matter of indifference whether we like oysters or clams, snails or shrimp, if only we know how to unravel the existential significance of these foods.","Remember, Orestes: you were part of my herd, you grazed in the fields along with my sheep. Your liberty is nothing but a mange eating away at you, it is nothing but an exile.","I am neither virgin nor priest enough to play with the inner life.","I consider Les Nourritures Terrestres as a frightening book: \\"Look for God in no other place than everywhere.\\" Go and tell that to a workman, an engineer!","Many young people today do not concern themselves with style. They think that what one says should be said simply and that is all. For me, style - which does not exclude simplicity, quite the opposite - is above all a way of saying three or four things in one. There is the simple sentence, with its immediate meaning, and then at the same time, below this immediate meaning, other meanings are organized. If one is not capable of giving language this plurality of meaning, then it is not worth the trouble to write.","There is no book of mine that I reject. That does not mean that I find them good.","A pale reflection of myself wavers in my consciousness...and suddenly the \u201cI\u201d pales, pales, and fades out.","Night is falling: at dusk, you must have good eyesight to be able to tell the Good Lord from the Devil.","I do not give a damn about the dead. They died for the [Communist] Party and the Party can decide what it wants. I practice a live man\'s politics, for the living.","It is not right, my fellow-countrymen, you who know very well all the crimes committed in our name. It\'s not at all right that you do not breathe a word about them to anyone, not even to your own soul, for fear of having to stand in judgment of yourself. I am willing to believe that at the beginning you did not realize what was happening; later, you doubted whether such things could be true; but now you know, and still you hold your tongues.","Life is a useless passion.","Man is always a wizard to man, and the social world is at first magical.","When my relations with the Communist Party gave me the necessary perspective I decided to write my autobiography. I wanted to show how a man can pass from literature held sacred to action which nevertheless remains that of an intellectual.","I had dreamed my life for nearly fifty years (I am about to be fifty-nine). But, you see,\\nthere are two tones in Les Mats: the echo of this condemnation and a mitigation of that severity.","Therefore, in the nature of this will for freedom, which freedom itself implies, I may pass judgement on those who seek to hide from themselves the complete arbitrariness and the complete freedom of their existence.","I was a neophyte in another world [in 1954].","I was escaping from Nature and at last becoming myself, that Other whom I was aspiring to be in the eyes of others.","On my way to the office in the morning, there are, in front of me, behind me, other men going to their jobs. I see them; if I dared, I would smile at them. I think to myself that I am a socialist, that they are the purpose of my life, of my efforts and that they do not know it yet.","I believe, I desire, that social and economic ills may be remedied.","Il n\'y a pas d\'autre univers qu\'un univers humain, l\'univers de la subjectivite   humaine. There is no other universe except the human universe, the universe of human subjectivity.","A human being who wakened in the morning with a queesy stomach, with fifteen hours to kill before next bedtime, had not much use for freedom.","I considered calmly that I was born to write.","Never have I thought that I was the happy possessor of a \\"talent;\\" my sole concern has been to save myself by work and faith.","The [Communist] Party has one objective: the creation of a socialist economy; and one means: the utilization of the class struggle.","L\'homme est une passion inutile. Man is a useless passion.","What do you want to do with the [Communist] Party? A racing stable? What good is it to sharpen a knife every day if you never useit for slicing? A party is never more than a means. There is only one objective: power.","Perception is naturally surpassed toward action; better yet, it can be revealed only in and through projects of action. The world is revealed as an \\"always future hollow\\", for we are always future to ourselves.","It is the same: a chosen one is a man whom God\'s finger crushes against the wall.","But for me there is neither Monday nor Sunday: there are days which pass in disorder, and then, sudden lightning like this one. Nothing has changed and yet everything is different. I can\'t describe it, it\'s like the Nausea and yet it\'s just the opposite: at last an adventure happens to me and when I question myself I see that it happens that I am myself and that I am here; I am the one who splits in the night, I am as happy as the hero of a novel.","I had been playing with matches and burned a small rug. I was in the process of covering up my crime when suddenly God saw me. I felt His gaze inside my head and on my hands....I flew into a rage against so crude an indiscretion, I blasphemed....He never looked at me again....I had the more difficulty getting rid of Him the Holy Ghost in that He had installed Himself at the back of my head....I collared the Holy Ghost in the cellar and threw Him out.","The appearance of the other in the world corresponds therefore to a congealed sliding of the whole universe.","I do not feel that I am the product of chance, a speck of dust in the universe, but someone who was expected, prepared, prefigured. In short, a being whom only a Creator could put here; and this idea of a creating hand refers to God.","I know. I know that I shall never again meet anything or anybody who will inspire me with passion. You know, it\'s quite a job starting to love somebody. You have to have energy, generosity, blindness. There is even a moment, in the very beginning, when you have to jump across a precipice: if you think about it you don\'t do it. I know I\'ll never jump again.","Ah! How I hate the crimes of the new generation: they are dry and sterile as darnel.","All the same, they [books] do serve some purpose. Culture doesn\'t save anything or anyone, it doesn\'t justify. But it\'s a product of man: he projects himself into it, he recognizes himself in it; that critical mirror alone offers him his image.","Once liberty has exploded in the soul of a man, the gods can do nothing against that man.","Understand me: I wish to be a man from somewhere, a man among men. You see, a slave, when he passes by, weary and surly, carrying a heavy load, limping along and looking down at his feet, only at his feet to avoid falling down; he is in his town, like a leaf in greenery, like a tree in a forest, argos surrounds him, heavy and warm, full of herself; I want to be that slave, Electra, I want to pull the city around me and to roll myself up in it like a blanket. I will not leave.","Ah! Do not judge the gods, young man, they have painful secrets.","Good digestions, the gray monotony of provincial life, and the boredom-ah the soul-destroying boredom-of long days of mild content.","Man exists, turns up, appears on the scene and only afterwards, defines himself","Generally speaking there is no irreducible taste or inclination. They all represent a certain appropriative choice of being. It is up to existential psychoanalysis to compare and classify\\nthem. Ontology abandons us here; it has merely enabled us to determine the ultimate ends of human reality, its fundamental possibilities, and the value which haunts it.","Everything in my past, in my training, everything that has been most essential in my activity up to now has made me above all a man who writes, and it is too late for that to change.","Man is always separated from what he is by all the breadth of the being which he is not. He makes himself known to himself from the other side of the world and he looks from the horizon\\n toward himself to recover his inner being.","The past is the luxury of proprietors.","Criminals together. We\'re in hell, my little friend, and there\'s never any mistake there. People are not damned for nothing.","Either the USSR was not the country of socialism, in which case socialism didn\'t exist anywhere and doubtless, wasn\'t possible: or else, socialism was that, this abominable monster, this police state, the power of beasts of prey.","If you are not already dead, forgive. Rancor is heavy, it is worldly; leave it on earth: die light.","Some men are born committed to action: they do not have a choice, they have been thrown on a path, at the end of that path, an act awaits them, their act.","Aegistheus, the kings have another secret.... Once liberty has exploded in the soul of a man, the Gods can do nothing against that man. It is a matter for men to handle amongst themselves, and it is up to other men and to them alone to let him flee or to destroy him.","The status of \'native\' is a nervous condition introduced and maintained by the settler among colonized people with their consent.","I distrust the incommunicable; it is the source of all violence","A good hanging now and then -- that entertains folk in the provinces and robs death of its glamour.","I know only one Church: it is the society of men.","I am a man, Jupiter, and each man must invent his own path.","Lord, you have cursed Cain and Cain\u2019s children: thy will be done. You have allowed men\u2019s hearts to be corrupted, that their intentions be rotten, that their actions putrefy and stink: thy will be done.","I receive letters from workers, from secretaries. . . . They are the most interesting ones.","The recent experiences of pocketbooks prove this. I have changed my public since my works have been published in a smaller format.","At that time [1954], as a result of political events, I was deeply preoccupied by my relations with the Communist Party.","Besides one should not believe that the people only want reading that is easy to absorb.","Total war is no longer war waged by all members of one national community against all those of another. It is total... because it may well involve the whole world.","What I lacked [in La Nausee] was a sense of reality. I have changed since. I have slowly learned to experience reality.","I don\'t know. Everything. Living. Smoking.","Through the lack of attaching myself to words, my thoughts remain nebulous most of the time. They sketch vague, pleasant shapes and then are swallowed up; I forget them almost immediately.","Little flashes of sun on the surface of a cold, dark sea.","I enjoy feeling fastidious and aloof. I enjoy saying no, always no, and I should be afraid of any attempt to construct a finally habitable world, because I should merely have to say - Yes; and act like other people.","My pessimism has never been flabby.","With a little luck that epoch may arrive. I am on the side of those who think that things will go better when the world has changed.","I think [Alain Robbe-Grillet] a good writer, but he speaks to the comfortable bourgeoisie.","The form [of literature] matters little to me, classical or not.","I say a murder is abstract.

So there remains within me a wide range of abilities, inclinations and potentialities, unused but perfectly viable, which endow me with a worthiness that could never be inferred from the mere history of my actions. But in reality and for the existentialist, there is no love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving; there is no genius other than that which is expressed in works of art.\u201d","I jump up: it would be much better if I could only stop thinking. Thoughts are the dullest things. Duller than flesh. They stretch out and there\'s no end to them and they leave a funny taste in the mouth.

I ex. . .\\" It goes, it goes . . . and there\'s no end to it. It\'s worse than the rest because I feel responsible and have complicity in it. For example, this sort of painful rumination: I exist, I am the one who keeps it up. I. The body lives by itself once it has begun. But though I am the one who continues it, unrolls it. I exist. How serpentine is this feeling of existing, I unwind it, slowly. ... If I could keep myself from thinking! I try, and succeed: my head seems to fill with smoke . . . and then it starts again: \\"Smoke . . . not to think . . . don\'t want to think ... I think I don\'t want to think. I mustn\'t think that I don\'t want to think. Because that\'s still a thought.\\" Will there never be an end to it?My thought is me: that\'s why I can\'t stop. I exist because I think . . . and I can\'t stop myself from thinking. At this very moment, it\'s frightful, if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing. I am the one who pulls myself from the nothingness to which I aspire: the hatred, the disgust of existing, there are as many ways to make myself exist, to thrust myself into existence. Thoughts are born at the back of me, like sudden giddiness, I feel them being born behind my head ... if I yield, they\'re going to come round in front of me, between my eyes, and I always yield, the thought grows and grows and there it is, immense, filling me completely and renewing my existence.","\u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062d\u064a\u0645","Life has no meaning, the moment you lose the illusion of being eternal.","I dreamed vaguely of killing myself to wipe out at least one of these superfluous lives.

The past did not exist. Not at all. Not in things, not even in my thoughts. It is true that I had realized a long time ago that mine had escaped me. But until then I had believed that it had simply gone out of my range. For me the past was only a pensioning off: it was another way of existing, a state of vacation and inaction; each event, when it had played its part, put itself politely into a box and became an honorary event: we have so much difficulty imagining nothingness.

They assume vague, amusing shapes and are then swallowed up: I promptly forget them.","What if something were to happen? What if something suddenly started throbbing? Then they would notice it was there and they\'d think their hearts were going to burst. Then what good would their dykes, bulwarks, power houses, furnaces and pile drivers be to them? It can happen any time, perhaps right now: the omens are present. For example, the father of a family might go out for a walk, and, across the street, he\'ll see something like a red rag, blown towards him by the wind. And when the rag has gotten close to him he\'ll see that it is a side of rotten meat, grimy with dust, dragging itself along by crawling, skipping, a piece of writhing flesh rolling in the gutter, spasmodically shooting out spurts of blood. Or a mother might look at her child\'s cheek and ask him: \\"What\'s that, a pimple?\\" and see the flesh puff out a little, split, open, and at the bottom of the split an eye, a laughing eye might appear. Or they might feel things gently brushing against their bodies, like the caresses of reeds to swimmers in a river. And they will realize that their clothing has become living things. And someone else might feel something scratching in his mouth. He goes to the mirror, opens his mouth: and his tongue is an enormous, live centipede, rubbing its legs together and scraping his palate. He\'d like to spit it out, but the centipede is a part of him and he will have to tear it out with his own hands. And a crowd of things will appear for which people will have to find new names, stone eye, great three cornered arm, toe crutch, spider jaw. And someone might be sleeping in his comfortable bed, in his quiet, warm room, and wake up naked on a bluish earth, in a forest of rustling birch trees, rising red and white towards the sky like the smokestacks of Jouxtebouville, with big bumps half way out of the ground, hairy and bulbous like onions. And birds will fly around these birch trees and pick at them with their beaks and make them bleed. Sperm will flow slowly, gently, from these wounds, sperm mixed with blood, warm and glassy with little bubbles.","The Nausea has not left me and I don\'t believe it will leave me so soon; but I no longer have to bear it, it is no longer an illness or a passing fit: it is I.","Something is beginning in order to end: adventure does not let itself be drawn out; it only makes sense when dead.

And the story goes on in reverse: instants have stopped piling themselves in a lighthearted way one on top of the other, they are snapped up by the end of the story which draws them and each one of them in turn, draws out the preceding instant: \\"It was night, the street was deserted.\\" The phrase is cast out negligently, it seems superfluous; but we do not let ourselves be caught and we put it aside: this is a piece of information whose value we shall subsequently appreciate. And we feel that the hero has lived all the details of this night like annunciations, promises, or even that he lived only those that were promises, blind and deaf to all that did not herald adventure. We forget that the future was not yet there; the man was walking in a night without forethought, a night which offered him a choice of dull rich prizes, and he did not make his choice.

I ran along the docks, turned into the deserted streets in the Beauvoisis district; the houses watched my flight with their mournful eyes. I repeated with anguish: Where shall I go? where shall I go? Anything can happen. Sometimes, my heart pounding, I made a sudden right about turn: what was happening behind my back? Maybe it would start behind me and when I would turn around, suddenly, it would be too late. As long as I could stare at things nothing would happen: I looked at them as much as I could, pavements, houses, gaslights; my eyes went rapidly from one to the other, to catch them unawares, stop them in the midst of their metamorphosis. They didn\'t look too natural, but I told myself forcibly: this is a gaslight, this is a drinking fountain, and I tried to reduce them to their everyday aspect by the power of my gaze. Several times I came across barriers in my path: the Cafe des Bretons, the Bar de la Marine. I stopped, hesitated in front of their pink net curtains: perhaps these snug places had been spared, perhaps they still held a bit of yesterday\'s world, isolated, forgotten. But I would have to push the door open and enter. I didn\'t dare; I went on. Doors of houses frightened me especially. I was afraid they would open of themselves. I ended by walking in the middle of the street.I suddenly came out on the Quai des Bassins du Nord. Fishing smacks and small yachts. I put my foot on a ring set in the stone. Here, far from houses, far from doors, I would have a moment of respite. A cork was floating on the calm, black speckled water.\\"And under the water? You haven\'t thought what could be under the water.\\"A monster? A giant carapace? sunk in the mud? A dozen pairs of claws or fins labouring slowly in the slime. The monster rises.

It\'s rather the way in which the moments are linked together. I think this is what happens: you suddenly feel that time is passing, that each instant leads to another, this one to another one, and so on; that each instant is annihilated, and that it isn\'t worth while to hold it back, etc., etc. And then you attribute this property to events which appear to you in the instants; what belongs to the form you carry over to the content. You talk a lot about this amazing flow of time but you hardly see it. You see a woman, you think that one day she\'ll be old, only you don\'t see her grow old. But there are moments when you think you see her grow old and feel yourself growing old with her: this is the feeling of adventure.","But the operation of writing implies that of reading as its dialectical correlative and these two connected acts necessitate two distinct agents. It is the joint effort of author and reader, which brings upon the scene that concrete and imaginary object which is the work of the mind. There is no art except for and by others.","A little more and I would have fallen into the mirror trap. I avoided it, but only to fall into the window trap: with nothing to do, my arms dangling, I go over to the window.","We have to deal with human reality as a being which is what it is not and which is not what it is.","She is dearer to me than life.

And if he does not say that to himself, he is masking his anguish. There is no question here of the kind of anguish which would lead to quietism, to inaction. It is a matter of a simple sort of anguish that anybody who has had responsibilities is familiar with.\u201d","You are what you are not and are not what you are.","How can you expect my character to be solidly real, to be anything other than obviously imaginary, when everything is contingent anyway?

To exist is simply to be there; those who exist let themselves be encountered, but you can never deduce anything from them. I believe there are people who have understood this. Only they tried to overcome this contingency by inventing a necessary, causal being. But no necessary being can explain existence: contingency is not a delusion, a probability which can be dissipated; it is the absolute, consequently, the perfect free gift. All is free, this park, this city and myself. When you realize that, it turns your heart upside down and everything begins to float, as the other evening at the \\"Railwaymen\'s Rendezvous\\": here is Nausea; here there is what those bastards\u2014the ones on the Coteau Vert and others\u2014try to hide from themselves with their idea of their rights. But what a poor lie: no one has any rights; they are entirely free, like other men, they cannot succeed in not feeling superfluous. And in themselves, secretly, they are superfluous, that is to say, amorphous, vague, and sad.","I murmur: \\"It\'s a seat,\\" a little like an exorcism. But the word stays on my lips: it refuses to go and put itself on the thing. It stays what it is, with its red plush, thousands of little red paws in the air, all still, little dead paws. This enormous belly turned upward, bleeding, inflated\u2014bloated with all its dead paws, this belly floating in this car, in this grey sky, is not a seat. It could just as well be a dead donkey tossed about in the water, floating with the current, belly in the air in a great grey river, a river of floods; and I could be sitting on the donkey\'s belly, my feet dangling in the clear water.","Do you regret those days?\'\'No,\' replied Marcelle acidly: \'but I regret the life I might have had.","Me gustar\xeda tanto abandonarme, olvidarme, dormir.

I don\'t need to turn around to know they are watching me through the windows: they are watching my back with surprise and disgust; they thought I was like them, that I was a man, and I deceived them. I suddenly lost the appearance of a man and they saw a crab running backwards out of this human room. Now the unmasked intruder has fled: the show goes on.","I know very well that I don\'t want to do anything: to do something is to create existence\u2014and there\'s quite enough existence as it is.","This sun and blue sky were only a snare.

The eyes, nose, and mouth disappear. Nothing is left. Brown wrinkles show on each side of the feverish swelled lips, crevices, mole holes. A silky, white down covers the great slopes of the cheeks, two hairs protrude from the nostrils: it is a geological embossed map. And, in spite of everything, this lunar world is familiar to me. I cannot say I recognize the details. But the whole thing gives me an impression of something seen before which stupefies me: I slip quietly off to sleep.","I was there, standing in front of a window whose panes had a definite refraction index. But what feeble barriers! I suppose it is out of laziness that the world is the same day after day. Today it seemed to want to change. And then, anything, anything could happen.","I found everything perfectly clear, and I really understood absolutely nothing.","You didn\'t succeed. Well, what of that?

I dreamed vaguely of killing myself to wipe out at least one of these superfluous lives. But even my death would have been In the way.In the way, my corpse, my blood on these stones, between these plants, at the back of this smiling garden. And the decomposed flesh would have been In the way in the earth which would receive my bones, at last, cleaned, stripped, peeled, proper and clean as teeth, it would have been In the way: I was In the way for eternity.","But faced with this great wrinkled paw, neither ignorance nor knowledge was important: the world of explanations and reasons is not the world of existence.","There exist concretely alarm clocks, signboards, tax forms, policemen, so many guard rails against anguish. But as soon as the enterprise is held at a distance from me, as soon as I am referred to myself because I must await myself in the future, then I discover myself suddenly as the one who gives its meaning to the alarm clock, the one who by a signboard forbids himself to walk on a flower bed or on the lawn, the one from whom the boss\'s order borrows its urgency, the one who decides the interest of the book which he is writing, the one who finally makes the values exist in order to determine his action by their demands. I emerge alone and in anguish confronting the unique and original project which constitutes my being; all the barriers, all the guard rails collapse, nihilated by the consciousness of my freedom.","I\'m not obstinate, I\'m highly strung: I don\'t know how to let myself go. I must always think of what is happening to me - it\'s a form of self-protection.","These young people amaze me; drinking their coffee, they tell clear, plausible stories. If you ask them what they did yesterday, they don\'t get flustered; they tell you all about it in a few words. If I were in their place, I\'d start stammering.

When you live alone, you even forget what it is to tell a story : plausibility disappears at the same time as friends.","Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness and dies by chance.

I seem to be a sort of flabby mass in which words are engulfed; no sooner do I name myself than what is named is merged in him who names, and one gets no farther. I have often wanted to hate myself and, as you know, had good reasons for so doing. But my attempted hatred of myself was absorbed into my insubstantiality and was nothing but a recollection. I could not love myself either, I am sure, though I have never tried to. But I was eternally compelled to be myself; I was my own burden, but never burdensome enough, Mathieu. For one instant, on that June evening when I elected to confess to you, I thought I had encountered myself in your bewildered eyes.You saw me, in your eyes I was solid and predictable; my acts and moods were the actual consequences of a definite entity. And through me you knew that entity. I described it to you in my words, I revealed to you facts unknown to you, which had helped you to visualize it. And yet you saw it, I merely saw you seeing it. For one instant you were the heaven-sent mediator between me and myself, you perceived that compact and solid entity which I was and wanted to be in just as simple and ordinary a way as I perceived you. For, after all, I exist, I am, though I have no sense of being; and it is an exquisite torment to discover in oneself such utterly unfounded certainty, such unsubstantiated pride. I then understood that one could not reach oneself except through another\u2019s judgment, another\u2019s hatred. And also through another\u2019s love perhaps; but there is here no question of that. For this revelation I am not ungrateful to you. I do not know how you would describe our present relations. Not goodwill, nor wholly hatred. Put it that there is a corpse between us. My corpse.","Something has happened to me, I can\'t doubt it anymore. It came as an illness does, not like an ordinary certainty, not like anything evident. It came cunningly, little by little; I felt a little strange, a little put out, that\'s all. Once established it never moved, it stayed quiet, and i was able to persuade myself that nothing was the matter with me, that it was a false alarm. And now, it\'s blossoming.","Everything happens to every man as if the entire human race were staring at him and measuring itself by what he does. So every man ought to be asking himself, \\"Am I really a man who is entitled to act in such a way that the entire human race should be measuring itself by my actions?\\" And if he does not ask himself that, he masks his anguish.","It looked like a colour, but also... like a bruise or a secretion, like an oozing-and something else, an odour, for example, it melted into the odour of wet earth, warm, moist wood, into a black odour that spread like varnish over this sensitive wood, in a flavour of chewed, sweet fibre. I did not simply see this black: sight is an abstract invention, a simplified idea, one of man\'s ideas. That black, amorphous, weakly presence, far surpassed sight, smell and taste. But this richness was lost in confusion and finally was no more because it was too much.","I get up. I move through this pale light; I see it change beneath my hands and on the sleeves of my coat: I cannot describe how much it disgusts me.","Never were we freer than under the German Occupation.","This is what fools people: a man is always a teller of tales, he lives surrounded by his stories and the stories of others, he sees everything that happens to him through them; and he tries to live his own life as if he were telling a story.

I have only my body: a man entirely alone, with his lonely body, cannot indulge in memories; they pass through him. I shouldn\'t complain: all I wanted was to be free.","So I was a poodle of the future; I made prophecies.","I slip Anny\'s letter back into my despatch case: she has done what she could; I cannot reach the woman who took it in her hands, folded and put it in the envelope. Is it possible even to think of someone in the past? As long as we loved each other, we never allowed the meanest of our instants, the smallest grief, to be detached and forgotten, left behind. Sounds, smells, nuances of light, even the thoughts we never told each other; we carried them all away and they remained alive: even now they have the power to give us joy and pain. Not a memory: an implacable, torrid love, without shadow, without escape, without shelter. Three years rolled into one. That is why we parted: we did not have enough strength to bear this burden. And then, when Anny left me, all of a sudden, all at once, the three years crumbled into the past. I didn\'t even surfer, I felt emptied out. Then time began to flow again and the emptiness grew larger. Then, in Saigon when I decided to go back to France, all that was still left\u2014strange faces, places, quays on the banks of long rivers\u2014all was wiped out. Now my past is nothing more than an enormous vacuum. My present: this waitress in the black blouse dreaming near the counter, this man. It seems as though I have learned all I know of life in books.","Every belief is a belief that falls short; one never wholly believes what one believes.","L\'existentialiste, au contraire, pense qu\'il est tr\xe8s g\xeanant que Dieu n\'existe pas, car avec lui dispara\xeet toute possibilit\xe9 de trouver des valeurs dans un ciel intelligible; il ne peut plus y avoir de bien a priori, puisqu\'il n\'y a pas de conscience infinie et parfaite pour le penser; il n\'est \xe9crit nulle part que le bien existe, qu\'il faut \xeatre honn\xeate, qu\'il ne faut pas mentir, puisque pr\xe9cis\xe9ment nous sommes sur un plan o\xf9 il y a seulement des hommes.","Moi, je ne tiens pas les rancunes et j\'avoue tout, complaisamment : pour l\'autocritique, je suis dou\xe9, \xe0 la condition qu\'on ne pr\xe9tende pas me l\'imposer.","Existentialism\'s first move is to make every man aware of what he is and to make the full responsibility of his existence rest on him.","Not only is man what he conceives himself to be, but he is also only what he wills himself to be after this thrust toward existence.

The small child is drawn as if by magic to holes. He can not restrain himself from putting in his finger or his whole arm. He makes a symbolic sacrifice of his body to cause the void to disappear and a plenitude of being to exist. The fundamental tendency of human beings to stop up holes persists throughout life, symbolically and in reality. And only from this standpoint can we understand why the feminine sex is obscene. It is obscene because it is a hole and because it sends out an appeal for a plenitude of flesh. A woman also senses her condition as such an appeal, such an enticement. Thus every hole becomes something obscene because it \u201cis an obscene expectation.","There\u2019s the story of a person who does this, does that, but it isn\u2019t I, I have nothing in common with him.

It seems inevitable, so strong is the necessity of this music: nothing can interrupt it, nothing which comes from this time in which the world has fallen; it will stop by itself, as if by order. If I love this beautiful voice it is especially because of that: it is neither for its fulness nor its sadness, rather because it is the event for which so many notes have been preparing, from so far away, dying that it might be born. And yet I am troubled; it would take so little to make the record stop: a broken spring, the whim of Cousin Adolphe. How strange it is, how moving, that this hardness should be so fragile. Nothing can interrupt it yet it can break it. The last chord has died away.

Reassembled and compressed, one hand on my tomb and the other on my cradle, I felt brief and splendid, a flash of lightening swallowed up in darkness.","I felt that the success of the enterprise was in my hands: the moment had an obscure meaning which had to be trimmed and perfected ; certain motions had to be made, certain words spoken : I staggered under the weight of my responsibility.

I draw back my hand and put it in my pocket; but immediately I feel the warmth of my thigh through the stuff. I pull my hand out of my pocket and let it hang against the back of the chair. Now I feel a weight at the end of my arm. It pulls a little, softly, insinuatingly it exists. I don\'t insist: no matter where I put it it will go on existing; I can\'t suppress it, nor can I suppress the rest of my body, the sweaty warmth, which soils my shirt, nor all this warm obesity which turns lazily, as if someone were stirring it with a spoon, nor all the sensations going on inside, going, coming, mounting from my side to my armpit or quietly vegetating from morning to night, in their usual corner.","Algo comienza para terminar; la aventura no admite a\xf1adiduras; s\xf3lo cobra sentido con su muerte.

Subjectivism means, on the one hand, the freedom of the individual subject and, on the other, that man cannot pass beyond human subjectivity. It is the latter which is the deeper meaning of existentialism. When we say that man chooses himself, we do mean that every one of us must choose himself; but by that we also mean that in choosing for himself he chooses for all men. For in effect, of all the actions a man may take in order to create himself as he wills to be, there is not one which is not creative, at the same time, of an image of man such as he believes he ought to be. To choose between this or that is at the same time to affirm the value of that which is chosen; for we are unable ever to choose the worse. What we choose is always the better; and nothing can be better for us unless it is better for all. If, moreover, existence precedes essence and we will to exist at the same time as we fashion our image, that image is valid for all and for the entire epoch in which we find ourselves. Our responsibility is thus much greater than we had supposed, for it concerns mankind as a whole.\u201d","I feel there are no more perfect moments. I feel it in my legs when I walk.

First I lost the memory of her eyes, then the memory of her long body. I kept her smile as long as possible and then, finally lost that three years ago. Just now, brusquely, as I was taking the letter from the landlady\'s hands, it came back to me; I thought I saw Anny smiling. I try to refresh my memory: I need to feel all the tenderness that Anny inspires; it is there, this tenderness, it is near me, only asking to be born. But the smile does not return: it is finished.

What is he afraid of? When you want to understand something you stand in front of it, alone, without help: all the past in the world is of no use.

In my grandfather\'s study, they were everywhere; it was forbidden to dust them except once a year, before the October term. Even before I could read, I already revered these raised stones; upright or leaning, wedged together like bricks on the library shelves or nobly placed like avenues of dolmens, I felt that our family prosperity depended on them. They were all alike, and I was romping about in a tiny sanctuary, surrounded by squat, ancient monuments which had witnessed my birth, which would witness my death and whose permanence guaranteed me a future as calm as my past. I used to touch them in secret to honour my hands with their dust but I did not have much idea what to do with them and each day I was present at ceremonies whose meaning escaped me: my grandfather - so clumy, normally, that my grandmother buttoned his gloves for him - handled these cultural objects with the dexterity of an officiating priest. Hundreds of times I saw him get up absent-mindedly, walk round the table, cross the room in two strides, unhesitatingly pick out a volume without allowing himself time for choice, run through it as he went back to his armchair, with a combined movement of his thumb and right forefinger, and, almost before he sat down, open it with a flick \\"at the right page,\\" making it creak like a shoe. I sometimes got close enough to observe these boxes which opened like oysters and I discovered the nakedness of their internal organs, pale, dank, slightly blistering pages, covered with small black veins, which drank ink and smelt of mildew.","nothing that exists can be comic; it was like a floating analogy, almost entirely elusive, with certain aspects of vaudeville.","How far away from them I feel, up on this hill. It seems to me that I belong to another species.","There is something I longed for more than all the rest \u2013 without realizing it properly.

Yes, now\'s the moment; I\'m looking at this thing on the mantelpiece, and I understand that I\'m in hell. I tell you, everything\'s been thoughtout beforehand. They knew I\'d stand at the fireplace stroking this thing of bronze, with all those eyes intent on me. Devouring me. What? Only two of you? I thought there were more; many more. So this is hell. I\'d never have believed it. You remember all we were told about the torture-chambers, the fire and brimstone, the \\"burning marl.\\" Old wives\' tales! There\'s no need for red-hot pokers. HELL IS-OTHER PEOPLE!","Someone will say, \\"I did not ask to be born.\\" This is a naive way of throwing greater emphasis on our facticity. I am responsible for everything, in fact,except for my very responsibility, for I am not the foundation of my being. Therefore everything takes place as if I were compelled to be responsible. I am abandoned in the world, not in the sense that I might remain abandoned and passive in a hostile universe like a board floating on the water, but rather in the sense that I find myself suddenly alone and without help, engaged in a world for which I bear the whole responsibility without being able, whatever I do, to tear myself away from this responsibility for an instant. For I am responsible for my very desire of fleeing responsibilities. To make myself passive in the world, to refuse to act upon things and upon Others is still to choose myself, and suicide is one mode among others of being-in-the-world. Yet I find an absolute responsibility for the fact that my facticity (here the fact of my birth) is directly inapprehensible and even inconceivable, for this fact of my birth never appears as a brute fact but always across a projective reconstruction of my for-itself. I am ashamed of being born or I am astonished at it or I rejoice over it, or in attempting to get rid of my life I affirm that I live and I assume this life as bad. Thus in a certain sense I choose being born.","Aku suka menyadari betapa kerasnya buku bertahan, tidak pernah mau takluk begitu saja padaku; aku jadi terpedaya, capai, tetapi aku amat menikmati ambiguitas posisiku: \\"mengerti tetapi tidak mengerti\\".","A doll with skin like that isn\'t going to mess it up with a revolver shot.

Nor, on the other hand, if God does not exist, are we provided with any values or commands that could legitimise our behaviour. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. \u2013 We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free.

It declares, rather, that even if God existed that would make no difference from its point of view. Not that we believe God does exist, but we think that the real problem is not that of His existence; what man needs is to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God.","If existence really does precede essence, there is no explaining things away by reference to a fixed and given human nature, In other words, there is no determinism, man is free, man is freedom. On the other hand, if God does not exist, we find no values or commands to turn to which legitimize our conduct. So, in the bright realm of values, we have no excuses behind us, no justification before us. We are alone with no excuses.This is the idea I shall try to convey when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet in other respects is free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.","First, it has been charged with inviting people to remain in a kind of desperate quietism because, since no solutions are possible, we should have to consider action in this world as quite impossible.

That is the mirage: the future is more real than the present. It is not surprising: in a completed life, the end is taken as the truth of the beginning. The dead man stands half-way between being and worth, between the crude fact and its reconstruction: his history becomes a kind of circular essence which is summed up in each of his moments.","But an adventure never returns nor is prolonged.","\u041c\u044f\u0433\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442; \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043c, \u043e\u043d\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e, \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0436\u0433\u043b\u0438 \u043b\u0430\u043c\u043f\u044b. \u041e\u043d\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0442 \u0432 \u043e\u043a\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0431\u043e. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0438\u0445... \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043f\u043e-\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c\u0443. \u041e\u043d\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0443\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430, \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0445 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438 - \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u044b, \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441-\u043f\u0430\u043f\u044c\u0435, \u0448\u0438\u0440\u043c\u044b, \u0448\u0430\u043b\u0438. \u0418\u0445 \u0448\u043a\u0430\u0444\u044b \u0431\u0438\u0442\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044b \u0431\u0443\u0442\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439, \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 - \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0448\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430.\u0410 \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0431\u044b \u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0435? \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0448\u044c, \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u043c, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c. \u0423 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u043e, \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0442\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u0432\u043e\u0437\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e. \u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f: \u044f \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e - \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u043c.","The function of a writer is to call a spade a spade. If words are sick, it is up to us to cure them. Instead of that, many writers live off this sickness. In many cases modern literature is a cancer of words. ... There is nothing more deplorable than the literary practice which, I believe, is called poetic prose and which consists of using words for the obscure harmonics which reosund about them and which are made up of vague meanings which are in contradiction with the clear meaning. .... That is not all: we are living in an age of mystifications. Some are fundamental ones which are due to the structure of society; some are secondary. At any rate, the social order today rests upon the mystification of consciousness, as does disorder as well.","Those who conceal from themselves this total freedom, under the guise of solemnity, or by making deterministic excuses, I will call cowards.

Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet, in other respects is free; because, once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does. The existentialist does not believe in the power of passion. He will never agree that a sweeping passion is a ravaging torrent which fatally leads a man to certain acts and is therefore an excuse. He thinks that man is responsible for his passion.","La plupart du temps, faute de s\'attacher \xe0 des mots, mes pens\xe9es restent des brouillards.

Now I think of no one any more. I don\'t even bother looking for words. It flows in me, more or less quickly. I fix nothing, I let it go. Through the lack of attaching myself to words, my thoughts remain nebulous most of the time. They sketch vague, pleasant shapes and then are swallowed up: I forget them almost immediately.","I marvel at these young people: drinking their coffee, they tell clear, plausible stories. If they are asked what they did yesterday, they aren\'t embarrassed: they bring you up to date in a few words. If I were in their place, I\'d fall over myself. It\'s true that no one has bothered about how I spend my time for a long while. When you live alone you no longer know what it is to tell something: the plausible disappears at the same time as the friends.","And naturally, everything they tell about in books can happen in real life, but not in the same way. It is to this way of happeningthat I clung so tightly.","One thus arrives at a curious conception of thought. Thought has no real, concrete existence, accessible to immediate consciousness, since the datum of introspection is the image. It has no universality in act, because, if it were so, one should be able to grasp it directly. But it is a potential universality that one derives from the fact that a word can be accompanied by very different images.","Our job as a writer is to represent the world and to bear witness to it.","\u0643\u0646\u062a \u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0623\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0643\u0641\u0631\u0642\u0629 \u062a\u0647\u0628\u0637 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629.","Var olmak susamadan i\xe7mek gibi bir \u015feydir.","There is nothing very new about all that; I have never rejected these harmless emotions; far from it. In order to feel them, it is sufficent to be a little isolated, just enough to get rid plausability at the right moment. But I remained close to people, on the surface of solitude, quite determined, in case of emergency, to take refuge in their midst: so far I am an amateur at heart.Now, there are objects everywhere like this glass of beer, here on the table.

It exists its character in pure distinction non-thematically and non-thetically in the proof which it effects of its own contingency and in the nihilation by which it recognizes and surpasses its facticity. This is why pure introspective self-description does not give us character. Proust\'s hero \'does not have\' a directly apprehensible character; he is presented first as being conscious of himself as an ensemble of general reactions common to all men...in which each man can recognise himself. This is because these reactions belong to the general \'nature\' of the psychic.","Ben onun gibi umutsuz de\u011filim, \xe7\xfcnk\xfc bekledi\u011fim fazla bir \u015fey yok.

Serpent or claw or root or vulture\'s talon, what difference does it make.

But neither does a circle exist. This root, on the other hand, existed in such a way that I could not explain it. Knotty, inert, nameless, it fascinated me, filled my eyes, brought me back unceasingly to its own existence. In vain to repeat: \\"This is a root\\"\u2014it didn\'t work any more. I saw clearly that you could not pass from its function as a root, as a breathing pump, to that, to this hard and compact skin of a sea lion, to this oily, callous, headstrong look. The function explained nothing: it allowed you to understand generally that it was a root, but not that one at all. This root, with its colour, shape, its congealed movement, was . . . below all explanation. Each of its qualities escaped it a little, flowed out of it, half solidified, almost became a thing; each one was In the way in the root and the whole stump now gave me the impression of unwinding itself a little, denying its existence to lose itself in a frenzied excess.","So a change has taken place during these last few weeks. But where? It is an abstract change without object. Am I the one who has changed? If not, then it is this room, this city and this nature; I must choose. I think I\u2019m the one who has changed: that\u2019s the simplest solution. Also the most unpleasant. But I must finally realize that I am subject to these sudden transformations. The thing is that I rarely think; a crowd of small metamorphoses accumulate in me without my noticing it, and then, one fine day, a veritable revolution takes place. This is what has given my life such a jerky, incoherent aspect.","I scraped my heel against this black claw: I wanted to peel off some of the bark.

When they ran quickly under your nose like startled hares and you didn\'t pay too much attention, you might believe them to be simple and reassuring, you might believe that there was real blue in the world, real red, a real perfume of almonds or violets. But as soon as you held on to them for an instant, this feeling of comfort and security gave way to a deep uneasiness: colours, tastes, and smells were never real, never themselves and nothing butthemselves.","If anyone had asked me what existence was, I would have answered, in good faith, that it was nothing, simply an empty form which was added to external things without changing anything in their nature. And then all of a sudden, there it was, clear as day: existence had suddenly unveiled itself. It had lost the harmless look of an abstract category: it was the very paste of things, this root was kneaded into existence. Or rather the root, the park gates, the bench, the sparse grass, all that had vanished: the diversity of things, their individuality, were only an appearance, a veneer. This veneer had melted, leaving soft, monstrous masses, all in disorder\u2014naked, in a frightful, obscene nakedness.","The simplest, most indefinable quality had too much content, in relation to itself, in its heart.","But this richness was lost in confusion and finally was no more because it was too much.","I am the Thing.

As if there could possibly be true stories; things happen one way and we tell about them in the opposite sense. You seem to start at the beginning: \\"It was a fine autumn evening in 1922. I was a notary\'s clerk in Marommes.\\" And in reality you have started at the end. It was there, invisible and present, it is the one which gives to words the pomp and value of a beginning. \\"I was out walking, I had left the town without realizing it, I was thinking about my money troubles.\\" This sentence, taken simply for what it is, means that the man was absorbed, morose, a hundred leagues from an adventure, exactly in the mood to let things happen without noticing them. But the end is there, transforming everything. For us, the man is already the hero of the story. His moroseness, his money troubles are much more precious than ours, they are all gilded by the light of future passions. And the story goes on in the reverse: instants have stopped piling themselves in lighthearted way one on top of the other, they are snapped up by the end of the story which draws them and each of them in turn, draws out the preceding instant. \\"it was night, the street was deserted.\\" The phrase is cast out negligently, it seems superfluous; but we do not let ourselves be caught and we put it aside: this a piece of information whose value we shall subsequently appreciate. And we feel that the hero has lived all the details of this night like annunciations, promises, or even that he lived only those that were promises, blind and deaf to all that did not herald adventure. We forget that the future was not yet there; the man was walking in a night without forethought, a night which offered him a choice of due rich prizes, and he did not make his choice.","Je ne suis ni le ma\xeetre ni l\'esclave, Jupiter. Je suis ma libert\xe9! \xc0 peine m\'as-tu cr\xe9\xe9 que j\'ai cess\xe9 de t\'appartenir","I thought it was so stupid, so out of place, I hated this ignoble mess. Mounting up, mounting up as high as the sky, spilling over, filling everything with its gelatinous slither, and I could see depths upon depths of it reaching far beyond the limits of the garden, the houses, and Bouville, as far as the eye could reach. I was no longer in Bouville, I was nowhere, I was floating. I was not surprised, I knew it was the World, the naked World suddenly revealing itself, and I choked with rage at this gross, absurd being. You couldn\u2019t even wonder where all that sprang from, or how it was that a world came into existence, rather than nothingness. It didn\u2019t make sense, the World was everywhere, in front, behind. There had been nothing before it. Nothing. There had never been a moment in which it could not have existed. That was what worried me: of course there was no reason for this flowing larva to exist. But it was impossible for it is not to exist. It was unthinkable: to imagine nothingness you had to be there already, in the midst of the World, eyes wide open and alive; nothingness was only an idea in my head, an existing idea floating in this immensity: this nothingness had not come before existence, it was an existence like any other and appeared after many others.","All was fullness and all was active, there was no weakness in time, all, even the least perceptible stirring, was made of existence. And all these existents which bustled about this tree came from nowhere and were going nowhere.","El amor es una gran cosa po\xe9tica que es preciso no espantar.","\u0628\u0647 \u062c\u0627\u064a \u062a\u0633\u0644\u0637 \u0628\u0631 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u064a\u0634\u062a\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0637 \u0634\u062f","If people throw up to us our works of fiction in which we write about people who are soft, weak, cowardly, and sometimes even downright bad, it\'s not be. cause these people are soft, weak, cowardly, or bad; because if we were to say, as Zola did, that they are that way because of heredity, the workings of environment, society, because of biological or psychological determinism, people would be reassured. They would say, \\"Well, that\'s what we\'re like, no one can doanything about it.\\" But when the existentialist writes about a coward, he says that this coward is responsible for his cowardice. He\'s not like that because he has a cowardly heart or lung or brain; he\'s not like that on account of his physiological make-up; but he\'s like that because he has made himself a coward by his acts. There\'s no such thing as a cowardly constitution; there are nervous constitutions; there is poor blood, as the common people say, or strong constitutions. But the man whose blood is poor is not a coward on that account, for what makes cowardice is the act of renouncing or yielding. A constitution is not an act; the coward is defined on the basis of the acts he performs. People feel, in a vague sort of way, that this coward we\'re talking about is guilty of being a coward, and the thought frightens them. What people would like is that a coward or a hero be born that way.","The only difference between image and idea is thus that in the one case, the expression of the object is confused, and in the other, it is clear. The confusion comes from this: every movement envelops in itself the infinity of the movements of the universe; and the brain receives an infinity of modifications to which only a confused thought can correspond, enveloping the infinity of clear ideas that would correspond to each detail. Clear ideas are therefore contained in the confused ideas. They are unconscious; they are perceived without being apperceived. Only their sum total is apperceived; this appears simple to us because of our ignorance of its components.","We still have not defined the intellectual yet: all we have are technicians of practical knowledge who either accommodate themselves to their contradiction or manage to avoid suffering from it. But when one of them becomes aware of the fact that despite the universality of his work it serves only particular interests, then his awareness of this contradiction - what Hegel called an \'unhappy consciousness\' - is precisely what characterizes him as an intellectual.","\xbfC\xf3mo yo, que no he tenido fuerzas para retener mi propio pasado puedo esperar que salvar\xe9 el de otro?","Thirdly, the existent individual is impassioned, impassioned with a passionate thought; he is inspired; he is a kind of incarnation of the infinite in the finite. This passion which animates the existent (and this brings us to the fourth characteristic) is what Kierkegaard calls \u201cthe passion of freedom.","I can\u2019t explain what I see. To anyone. There: I am quietly slipping into the water\u2019s depths, towards fear. I am alone in the midst of these happy, reasonable voices. All these creatures spend their time explaining, realizing happily that they agree with each other. In Heaven\u2019s name, why is it so important to think the same things all together.","I sank down on the bench, stupefied, stunned by this profusion of beings without origin: everywhere blossomings, hatchings out, my ears buzzed with existence, my very flesh throbbed and opened, abandoned itself to the universal burgeoning.","Ela n\xe3o tem amizade por mim.

Perhaps this is what I liked best in her, this austere loyalty to her most insignificant features.","\u041e\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e? \u041e\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u043e \u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0437\u0438 \u0431\u043b\u0443\u0434\u043a\u0430\u0432\u043e-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0438\u0432 \u0432\u043a\u0443\u0441 \u0432 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0438? \u041e\u0442 \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430? \u041e\u0442 \u0437\u0432\u044f\u0440\u0430? \u041e\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u043d? \u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0435 \u0432\u043a\u0443\u0441\u044a\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0435\u043a. \u0429\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044f, \u0432\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u043c\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0449\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u0438\u0431\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0449 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432? \u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432, \u043e\u043c\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430, \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d... \u041e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0438! \u0422\u043e\u0437\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u043a \u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430, \u0442\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430; \u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0449\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u044a\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430? \u0410? \u041e\u0442\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0435! \u041c\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0431\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0435\u043a \u043d\u044f\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0435. \u041c\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0431\u0438 \u043d\u044f\u043a\u043e\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430 \u0449\u0435 \u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438. \u0412\u0441\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e \u0449\u0435 \u0435 \u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442\u0432\u043e - \u043e\u0447\u0438, \u0441\u044a\u0434\u0438\u0438, \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435. \u041d\u043e\u0449. \u041e, \u0441\u044a\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0449\u0442\u0430, \u0442\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0439\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0438 \u0431\u0438\u043b, \u043a\u043e\u0439\u0442\u043e \u0449\u0435 \u0431\u044a\u0434\u0435\u0448, \u043a\u043e\u0439\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0438 - \u0430\u0437 \u0431\u044f\u0445. \u0410\u0437 \u0431\u044f\u0445!","El mundo de las explicaciones y razones no es el de la existencia.","\u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0443 \u0432 \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0443\u0441\u043e\u043f\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439.","Lo que me asombra es sentirme tan triste y tan cansado.","A man rarely feels like laughing alone:","I have reconsidered my thoughts of yesterday.

And explode it does, as you and I know. And we live in an age of conflagration: it only needs the rising birth rate to worsen the food shortage, it only needs the newly born to fear living a little more than dying, and for the torrent of violence to sweep away all the barriers. In Algeria and Angola, Europeans are massacred on sight. This is the age of the boomerang, the third stage of violence: it flies right back at us, it strikes us and, once again, we have no idea what hit us. The \\"liberals\\" remain stunned: they admit we had not been polite enough to the \\"natives,\\" that it would have been wiser and fairer to grant them certain rights, wherever possible; they would have been only too happy to admit them in batches without a sponsor to that exclusive club -- the human species; and now this barbaric explosion of madness is putting them in the same boat as the wretched colonists. The metropolitan Left is in a quandary: it is well aware of the true fate of the \\"natives,\\" the pitiless oppression they are subjected to, and does not condemn their revolt, knowing that we did everything to provoke it. But even so, it thinks, there are limits: these guerrillas should make every effort to show some chivalry; this would be the best way of proving they are men. Sometimes the Left berates them: \\"You\'re going too far; we cannot support you any longer.\\" They don\'t care a shit for its support; it can shove it up its ass for what it\'s worth. As soon as the war began, they realized the harsh truth: we are all equally as good as each other. We have all taken advantage of them, they have nothing to prove, they won\'t give anyone preferential treatment. A single duty, a single objective: drive out colonialism by every means. And the most liberal among us would be prepared to accept this, at a pinch, but they cannot help seeing in this trial of strength a perfectly inhuman method used by subhumans to claim for themselves a charter for humanity: let them acquire it as quickly as possible, but in order to merit it, let them use nonviolent methods.

M. de Rollebon, who was passing by and who believed in nothing, bet the Cure of Moulins that he would need less than two hours to bring the sick man back to Christian sentiments.

When a tyrant falls, when an occupying army is ousted, when an oppressive regime gives way to a free and democratic order, a new day does not dawn. Triumphant speeches by new leaders may distract attention from the problems facing the liberated country; victory parades or spontaneous celebrations in the streets for a time may obscure deep divisions within the newly free society. But any occupation leaves scars on a nation\u2019s psyche. The complicity of some with the former rulers, the persecution of others at the hands of their fellow citizens, courageous acts of resistance offset by the passivity of the majority of the population\u2014only by facing these shameful features of its subjugation can the liberated nation achieve harmony, heal its wounds, and regain legitimacy in the eyes of the outside world.","When Sartre wrote \u201cParis Under the Occupation, the dead were still being mourned while the fate of prisoners of war and the deported remained unknown.

They have proof, a hundred times a day, that everything happens mechanically, that the world obeys fixed, unchangeable laws. In a vacuum all bodies fall at the same rate of speed, the public park is closed at 4 p.m. in winter, at 6 p.m. in summer, lead melts at 335 degrees centigrade, the last streetcar leaves the Hotel de Ville at 11.05 p.m. They are peaceful, a little morose, they think about Tomorrow, that is to say, simply, a new today; cities have only one day at their disposal and every morning it comes back exactly the same. They scarcely doll it up a bit on Sundays. Idiots. It is repugnant to me to think that I am going to see their thick, self-satisfied faces.

Not in music, but in the realm of art. Not a history book, because that is about what has existed, and existence is pointless, is not necessary.","Now when I say \u201cI, it seems hollow to me. I can\u2019t manage to feel myself very well, I am so forgotten. The only real thing left in me is existence which feels it exists. I yawn, lengthily. No one. Antoine Roquentin exists for on one. That amuses me. And just what is Antoine Roquentin? An abstraction. A pale reflection of myself wavers in my consciousness. Antoine Roquentin . . . and suddenly the \u201cI\u201d pales, pales, and fades out.Lucid, forlorn, consciousness is walled-up; it perpetuates itself. Nobody lives there any more. A little while ago someone said \u201cme,\u201d said my consciousness. Who? Outside there were streets, alive with known smells and colours. Now nothing is left but anonymous walls, anonymous consciousness. That is what there is: walls, and between the walls, a small transparency, alive and impersonal. Consciousness exists as a tree, as a blade of grass. It slumbers, it grows bored. Small fugitive presences populate it like birds in the branches. Populate it and disappear. Consciousness forgotten, forsaken between these walls, under this grey sky. And here is the sense of its existence: it is conscious of being superfluous. It dilutes, scatters itself, tries to lose itself on the brown wall, along the lamp post or down there in the evening mist. But it never forgets itself. That is its lot. There is a stifled voice which tells it: \u201cThe train leaves in two hours,\u201d and there is the consciousness of this voice. There is also consciousness of a face. It passes slowly, full of blood, spattered, and its bulging eyes weep. It is not between the walls, it is nowhere. It vanishes; a bent body with a bleeding face replaces it, walks slowly away, seems to stop at each step, never stops. There is a consciousness of this body walking slowly in a dark street. It walks but it gets no further away. The dark street does not end, it loses itself in nothingness. It is not between the walls, it is nowhere. And there is consciousness of a stifled voice which says: \u201cThe Self-Taught Man is wandering through the city.\u201dNot the same city, not between these toneless walls, the Self-Taught Man walks in a city where he is not forgotten.\u201d","The waitress does not move. In the glass her face seems to sleep. Her eyes are indeed open but they are only slits. That\u2019s the way she is, she is never in a hurry to wait on customers, she always takes a moment to dream over their orders. She must allow herself the pleasure of imagining: I believe she\u2019s thinking about the bottle she\u2019s going to take from above the counter, the white label and red letters, the thick black syrup she is going to pour out: it\u2019s a little as though she were drinking it herself.","The Age Of Reason 1. \u2018Well, it\u2019s that same frankness you fuss about so much. You\u2019re so absurdly scared of being your own dupe, my poor boy, that you would back out of the finest adventure in the world rather than risk telling yourself a lie.\u2019 2. \u201c I\u2019m not so much interested in myself as all that\u2019 he said simply.\u2018I know\u2019, said Marcelle. It isn\u2019t an aim , it\u2019s a means. It helps you to get rid of yourself; to contemplate and criticize yourself: that\u2019s the attitude you prefer. When you look at yourself, you imagine you aren\u2019t what you see, you imagine you are nothing. That is your ideal: you want to be nothing.\u2019\u20193. \u2018In vain he repeated the once inspiring phrase: \u2018I must be free: I must be self-impelled, and able to say: \u2018\u2019I am because I will: I am my own beginning.\u2019\u2019 Empty, pompous words, the commonplaces of the intellectual.\u20194. \u2018He had waited so long: his later years had been no more than a stand-to. Oppressed with countless daily cares, he had waited\u2026But through all that, his sole care had been to hold himself in readiness. For an act. A free, considered act; that should pledge his whole life, and stand at the beginning of a new existence\u2026.He waited. And during all that time, gently, stealthily, the years had come, they had grasped him from behind\u2026.\u20195. \u2018 \u2018It was love. This time, it was love. And Mathiue thought:\u2019 What have I done?\u2019 Five minutes ago this love didn\u2019t exist; there was between them a rare and precious feeling, without a name and not expressible in gestures.\u20196. \u2018 The fact is, you are beyond my comprehension: you, so prompt with your indignation when you hear of an injustice, you keep this woman for years in a humiliating position, for the sole pleasure of telling yourself that you are respecting your principles. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if it were true, if you really did adapt your life to your ideas. But, I must tell you once more\u2026you like that sort of life-placid, orderly, the typical life of an official.\u2019\u2018\u2019That freedom consisted in frankly confronting situations into which one had deliberately entered, and accepting all one\u2019s responsibilities.\u2019\u2018Well\u2026perhaps I\u2019m doing you an injustice. Perhaps you haven\u2019t in fact reached the age of reason, it\u2019s really a moral age\u2026perhaps I\u2019ve got there sooner than you have.\u2019 7. \u2018 I have nothing to defend. I am not proud of my life and I\u2019m penniless. My freedom? It\u2019s a burden to me, for years past I have been free and to no purpose. I simply long to exchange it for a good sound of certainty\u2026.Besides, I agree with you that no one can be a man who has not discovered something for which he is prepared to die.\u20198. \u2018\u2018I have led a toothless life\u2019, he thought. \u2018 A toothless life. I have never bitten into anything. I was waiting. I was reserving myself for later on-and I have just noticed that my teeth have gone. What\u2019s to be done? Break the shell? That\u2019s easily said. Besides, what would remain? A little viscous gum, oozing through the dust and leaving a glistering trail behind it.\u20199.\u2019\u2019 A life\u2019, thought Mathieu, \u2018is formed from the future just like the bodies are compounded from the void\u2019. He bent his head: he thought of his own life. The future had made way into his heart, where everything was in process and suspense. The far-off days of childhood, the day when he has said:\u2019I will be free\u2019, the day when he had said: \u2019I will be famous\u2019, appeared to him even now with their individual future, like a small, circled individual sky above them all, and the future was himself, himself just as he was at present, weary and a little over-ripe, they had claims upon him across the passage of time past, they maintained their insistencies, and he was often visited by attacks of devastating remorse, because his casual, cynical present was the original future of those past days.","But what a poor lie: no one has any rights; they are entirely free, like other men, they cannot succeed in not feeling superfluous.

A glorious little suffering has just been born, an exemplary suffering. Four notes on the saxophone. They come and go, they seem to say: You must be like us, suffer in rhythm. All right! Naturally, I\u2019d like to suffer that way, in rhythm, without complacence, without self-pity, with an arid purity. But is it my fault if the beer at the bottom of my glass is warm, if there are brown stains on the mirror, if I am not wanted, if the sincerest of my sufferings drags and weighs, with too much flesh and the skin too wide at the same time, like a sea-elephant, with bulging eyes, damp and touching and yet so ugly? No, they certainly can\u2019t tell me it\u2019s compassionate\u2014this little jewelled pain which spins around above the record and dazzles me. Not even ironic: it spins gaily, completely self-absorbed; like a scythe it has cut through the drab intimacy of the world and now it spins and all of us, Madeleine, the thick-set man, the patronne, myself, the tables, benches, the stained mirror, the glasses, all of us abandon ourselves to existence, because we were among ourselves, only among ourselves, it has taken us unawares, in the disorder, the day to day drift: I am ashamed for myself and for what exists in front of it.It does not exist. It is even an annoyance; if I were to get up and rip this record from the table which holds it, if I were to break it in two, I wouldn\u2019t reach it. It is beyond\u2014always beyond something, a voice, a violin note. Through layers and layers of existence, it veils itself, thin and firm, and when you want to seize it, you find only existants, you butt against existants devoid of sense. It is behind them: I don\u2019t even hear it, I hear sounds, vibrations in the air which unveil it. It does not exist because it has nothing superfluous: it is all the rest which in relation to it is superfluous. It is.And I, too, wanted to be. That is all I wanted; this is the last word. At the bottom of all these attempts which seemed without bonds, I find the same desire again: to drive existence out of me, to rid the passing moments of their fat, to twist them, dry them, purify myself, harden myself, to give back at last the sharp, precise sound of a saxophone note. That could even make an apologue: there was a poor man who got in the wrong world. He existed, like other people, in a world of public parks, bistros, commercial cities and he wanted to persuade himself that he was living somewhere else, behind the canvas of paintings, with the doges of Tintoretto, with Gozzoli\u2019s Florentines, behind the pages of books, with Fabrizio del Dongo and Julien Sorel, behind the phonograph records, with the long dry laments of jazz. And then, after making a complete fool of himself, he understood, he opened his eyes, he saw that it was a misdeal: he was in a bistro, just in front of a glass of warm beer. He stayed overwhelmed on the bench; he thought: I am a fool. And at that very moment, on the other side of existence, in this other world which you can see in the distance, but without ever approaching it, a little melody began to sing and dance: \u201cYou must be like me; you must suffer in rhythm.","En ve\u0301rite\u0301, la prompte retraite de mon pe\u0300re m\'avait gratifie\u0301 d\'un \xab \u0152dipe \xbb fort incomplet: pas de Sur-moi, d\'accord, mais point d\'agressivite\u0301 non plus.

I cannot act upon it, change a single note of it, or slow down its movement. But it depends on the real for its appearance: that the conductor does not faint away, that a fire in the hall does not put an end to the performance. From this we cannot conclude that the seventh symphony has come to an end. No, we only think that the performance of the symphony has ceased. Does this not show clearly that the performance of the symphony is its analogue? It can manifest itself only through analogues which are dated and which unroll in our time. But to experience it on these analogues the imaginative reduction must be functioning, that is, the real sounds must be apprehended as analogues. It therefore occurs as a perpetual elsewhere, a perpetual absence. We must not picture it (as does spandrell in point counterpoint by huxley as so many platonisms) as existing in another world, in an intelligible heaven. It is not only outside time and space as are essences, for instance it is outside the real, outside existence. I do not hear it actually, i listen to it in the imaginary. Here we find the explanation for the considerable difficulty we always experience in passing from the world of the theatre or of music into that of our daily affairs. There is in fact no passing from one world into the other, but only a passing from the imaginative attitude to that of reality. Aesthetic contemplation is an induced dream and the passing into the real is an actual waking up.","Ben ge\xe7mi\u015fimi nerede saklayaca\u011f\u0131m?

From time to time you make a semi-total: you say: I\u2019ve been travelling for three years, I\u2019ve been in Bouville for three years. Neither is there any end: you never leave a woman, a friend, a city in one go. And then everything looks alike: Shanghai, Moscow, Algiers, everything is the same after two weeks. There are moments\u2014rarely\u2014when you make a landmark, you realize that you\u2019re going with a woman, in some messy business. The time of a flash. After that, the procession starts again, you begin to add up hours and days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. April, May, June. 1924, 1925, 1926.That\u2019s living. But everything changes when you tell about life; it\u2019s a change no one notices: the proof is that people talk about true stories. As if there could possibly be true stories; things happen one way and we tell about them in the opposite sense. [...] \u201cI was out walking, I had left the town without realizing it, I was thinking about my money troubles. This sentence, taken simply for what it is, means that the man was absorbed, morose, a hundred leagues from an adventure, exactly in the mood to let things happen without noticing them. But the end is there, transforming everything. For us, the man is already the hero of the story. His moroseness, his money troubles are much more precious than ours, they are all gilded by the light of future passions. And the story goes on in the reverse: instants have stopped piling themselves in a lighthearted way one on top of the other, they are snapped up by the end of the story which draws them and each one of them in turn, draws out the preceding instant: \u201cIt was night, the street was deserted.\u201d The phrase is cast out negligently, it seems superfluous; but we do not let ourselves be caught and we put it aside: this is a piece of information whose value we shall subsequently appreciate. And we feel that the hero has lived all the details of this night like annunciations, promises, or even that he lived only those that were promises, blind and deaf to all that did not herald adventure. We forget that the future was not yet there; the man was walking in a night without forethought, a night which offered him a choice of dull rich prizes, and he did not make his choice.I wanted the moments of my life to follow and order themselves like those of a life remembered. You might as well try and catch time by the tail.\u201d","Lo que pasa es que rara vez pienso; entonces sin darme cuenta, se acumula en m\xed una multitud de peque\xf1as metamorfosis, y un buen d\xeda se produce una verdadera revoluci\xf3n.

It\u2019s rather the way in which the moments are linked together.
