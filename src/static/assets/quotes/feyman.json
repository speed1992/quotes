I was accused of being anti-women because of two stories: the first was a discussion of the subtleties of velocity, and involved a woman driver being stopped by a cop. There's a discussion about how fast she was going, and I had her raise valid objections to the cop's definitions of velocity. The letter said I was making the women look stupid. The other story they objected to was told by the great astronomer Arthur Eddington, who had just figured out that the stars get their power from burning hydrogen in a nuclear reaction producing helium. He recounted how, on the night after his discovery, he was sitting on a bench with his girlfriend. She said, \"Look how pretty the stars shine!\" To which he replied, \"Yes, and right now, I'm the only man in the world who knows how they shine.\" He was describing a kind of wonderful loneliness you have when you make a discovery. The letter claimed that I was saying a women is incapable of understanding nuclear reactions.

Everything looked like both.This growing confusion was resolved in 1925 or 1926 with the advent of the correct equations for quantum mechanics. Now we know how the electrons and light behave. But what can I call it? If I say they behave like particles I give the wrong impression; also if I say they behave like waves. They behave in their own inimitable way, which technically could be called a quantum mechanical way. They behave in a way that is like nothing that you have seen before. Your experience with things that you have seen before is incomplete. The behavior of things on a very tiny scale is simply different. An atom does not behave like a weight hanging on a spring and oscillating. Nor does it behave like a miniature representation of the solar system with little planets going around in orbits. Nor does it appear to be somewhat like a cloud or fog of some sort surrounding the nucleus. It behaves like nothing you have seen before.There is one simplication at least. Electrons behave in this respect in exactly the same way as photons; they are both screwy, but in exactly in the same way….The difficulty really is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourself, \"But how can it be like that?\" which is a reflection of uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar. I will not describe it in terms of an analogy with something familiar; I will simply describe it. There was a time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity. I do not believe there ever was such a time. There might have been a time when only one man did, because he was the only guy who caught on, before he wrote his paper. But after people read the paper a lot of people understood the theory of relativity in some way or other, certainly more than twelve. On the other hand, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics. So do not take the lecture too seriously, feeling that you really have to understand in terms of some model what I am going to describe, but just relax and enjoy it. I am going to tell you what nature behaves like. If you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this, you will find her a delightful, entrancing thing.

There are, roughly speaking, three ways.First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we can figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop's motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an over-all way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but prob-ably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."},{"id":541,"quote":"The trouble with playing a trick on a highly intelligent man like Mr. Teller is that the time it takes him to figure out from the moment that he sees there is something wrong till he understands exactly what happened is too damn small to give you any pleasure!"},{"id":542,"quote":"If you try once or twice to communicate and get pushed back, pretty soon you decide, “To hell with it."},{"id":543,"quote":"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.- Rogers Commission Report into the Challenger Crash, June 1986."},{"id":544,"quote":"Take this neat little equation here.

You must do the best you can—if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong—to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more subtle problem.

Everything goes because the sun is shining.\" And then we would have fun discussing it: \"No, the toy goes becaues the spring is wound up, I would say. \"How did the spring get would up\" he would ask. \"I wound it up\" \"And how did you get moving?\" \"From eating\" \"And food grows only because the sun is shining. So it's because the sun is shining that all these things are moving\" That would get the concept across that motion is simply the transformation of the sun's power.I turned the page. The answer was, for the wind-up toy, \"Energy makes it go.\" And for the boy on the bicycle, \"Energy makes it go.\" For everything \"Energy makes it go.\"Now that doesn't mean anything. Suppose it's \"Wakalixes.\" That's the general principle: \"Wakalixes makes it go.\" There is no knowledge coming in. The child doesn't learn anything; it's just a wordWhat the should have done is to look at the wind-up toy, see that there are springs inside, learn about springs, learn about wheels, and never mind \"energy\". Later on, when the children know something about how the toy actually works, they can discuss the more general principles of energy.It is also not even true that \"energy makes it go\", because if it stops, you could say, \"energy makes it stop\" just as well.

It is easy to confuse the proof itself with the relationship which it establishes. Clearly, the important thing to learn and to remember is the relationship, not the proof. In any particular circumstance we can either say “it can be shown that” such and such is true, or we can show it. In almost all cases, the particular proof that is used is concocted, first of all, in such form that it can be written quickly and easily on the chalkboard or on paper, and so that it will be as smooth-looking as possible. Consequently, the proof may look deceptively simple, when in fact, the author might have worked for hours trying different ways of calculating the same thing until he has found the neatest way, so as to be able to show that it can be shown in the shortest amount of time! The thing to be remembered, when seeing a proof, is not the proof itself, but rather that it can be shown that such and such is true. Of course, if the proof involves some mathematical procedures or “tricks” that one has not seen before, attention should be given not to the trick exactly, but to the mathematical idea involved.”"},{"id":595,"quote":"When sunlight, which contains red, yellow, green, and blue light, shines on a mud puddle with oil on it, the areas that strongly reflect each of those colors overlap and produce all kinds of combinations which our eyes see as different colors...This phenomenon of colors produced by the partial reflection of white light by two surfaces is called iridescence, and can be found in many places...the more you see how strangely Nature behaves, the harder it is to make a model that explains how even the simplest phenomena actually work."},{"id":596,"quote":"And then I thought to myself, \"you know, what they think of you is so fantastic, it's impossible to live up to it.

If we look at the moons of Jupiter we can understand everything about the way they move around that planet. Incidentally, there was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully by Rømer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. (One can find their schedules by waiting a very long time and finding out how long it takes on the average for the moons to go around.) Now they were ahead when Jupiter was particularly close to the earth and they were behind when Jupiter was farther from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation—it would have been, in fact, the death of this wonderful theory if there were no other explanation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth. This phenomenon showed that light does not travel instantaneously, and furnished the first estimate of the speed of light.

Our equations for the sun, for example, as a ball of hydrogen gas, describe a sun without sunspots, without the rice-grain structure of the surface, without prominences, without coronas. Yet, all of these are really in the equations; we just haven't found the way to get them out. ...The test of science is its ability to predict.

Today we cannot see that the water flow equations contain such things as the barber pole structure of turbulence that one sees between rotating cylinders.

(Do that with spots!)With gradually thicker and thicker layers of glass, partial reflection again increases to 16% and returns to zero-a cycle that repeats itself again and again(see Fig. 5). Newton discovered these oscillations and did one experiment that could be correctly interpreted only if the oscillations continued for 34,000 cycles! Today, with lasers (which produce a very pure, monochromatic light), we can see this cycle still going strong after more than 100,000,000 repetitions-which corresponds to glass that is more than 50 meters thick. (We don't see this phenomenon every day because the light source is normally not monochromatic.)So it turns out that our prediction of 8% is right as an overall average (since the actual amount varies in a regular pattern from zero to 16%), but it's exactly right only twice each cycle-like a stopped clock (which is right twice a day)."},{"id":749,"quote":"I wrote a letter to her and proposed.

The reason for this will be-come clear when we discuss the following phenomena: If we were to charge a body,say a comb, electrically, and then place a charged piece of paper at a distance andmove the comb back and forth, the paper will respond by always pointing to thecomb. If we shake it faster, it will be discovered that the paper is a little behind,there is a delay in the action. (At the first stage, when we move the comb ratherslowly, we find a complication which is magnetism. Magnetic influences have todo with charges in relative motion, so magnetic forces and electric forces can reallybe attributed to one field, as two different aspects of exactly the same thing. Achanging electric field cannot exist without magnetism.) If we move the chargedpaper farther out, the delay is greater. Then an interesting thing is observed.Although the forces between two charged objects should go inversely as thesquare of the distance, it is found, when we shake a charge, that the influenceextends very much farther out than we would guess at first sight.

Now they were ahead when Jupiter was particularly close to the earth and they were behind when Jupiter was farther from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation—it would have been, in fact, the death of this wonderful theory if there were no other explanation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.

Howdo we know? Because there is a clue. The proportion of the different isotopes—how much C12, how much C13, etc., is something which is never changed bychemical reactions, because the chemical reactions are so much the same for thetwo. The proportions are purely the result of nuclear reactions. By looking at theproportions of the isotopes in the cold, dead ember which we are, we can discoverwhat the furnace was like in which the stuff of which we are made was formed.That furnace was like the stars, and so it is very likely that our elements were\"made\" in the stars and spit out in the explosions which we call novae and super-novae.

I tried to teach her, when she was posing, to please stand up, because she was so elegant and striking. I finally talked her into that. Then she had another worry: she’s got “dents near her groin. I have to get out a book of anatomy to show her that it’s the attachment of the muscles to the ilium, and to explain to her that you can’t see these dents on everybody; to see them, everything must be just right, in perfect proportion, like she was.

In what way is it different ? We do not know where to look, or what tolook for, when something is memorized.
