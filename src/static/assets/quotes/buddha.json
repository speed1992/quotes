The method of trying to conquer hatred through hatred never succeeds in overcoming hatred. But, the method of overcoming hatred through non-hatred is eternally effective. That is why that method is described as eternal wisdom.",

His aim is accomplished, he is without fear, rid of craving and without stain. He has removed the arrows of changing existence. This is his last body.",

    "In every trial Let understanding fight for you.",
    "Wherever you live is your temple, if you treat it like one.",
    "Surely if living creatures saw the results of all their evil deeds, they would turn away from them in disgust. But selfhood blinds them, and they cling to their obnoxious desires. They crave pleasure for themselves and they cause pain to others; when death destroys their individuality, they find no peace; their thirst for existence abides and their selfhood reappears in new births. Thus they continue to move in the coil and can find no escape from the hell of their own making.",

    "Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. It can be argued that peace and happiness comes from the subjective internalised perspective of realizing things could be worse and being grateful they aren't. The alternative view that peace and happiness comes from the objective external perspective of having more and better things than at present, while important for growth, can be a never-ending source of jealousy, dissatisfaction and disappointment. A balance of the two, where people are grateful for what they have while striving for more seems the best blended perspective.",

    "Considera quem te aponta os defeitos como se te desvendasse tesouros. Segue o sábio que te reprova os erros. Na verdade, estar em tal companhia é um grande bem, e não um mal.",
    "¿Adónde vamos? Vamos a enfrentarnos con lo que hemos merecido, al encuentro de los efectos de las causas que promovimos. Aquellos cuya labor ha sido incompleta, rodarán solamente por la periferia de la rueda para retornar y completar sus tareas. En cambio, aquellos pocos que han hollado el sendero de equilibrio que conduce al Nirvana, donde una vez agotadas sus acciones, los seres se reúnen con la Causa Incausada de la que partieron, van para aguardar el nuevo destino que el Creador considere apropiado asignarles.",

    "Miközben a Magasztos egyedül, magában ült ott, ez a gondolata támadt:- Ez a tan mély, nehezen felfogható, nehezen érthető, nyugalmat adó, magasrendű, ésszel fel nem érhető, titkos, csak bölcseknek szóló. Számomra világos lett. Ám az emberek vágyaik rabjai, vágyaikon csüggenek, vágyaikat élvezik. Ezért az emberek, akik vágyaik rabjai, vágyaikon csüggenek, vágyaikat élvezik, nem fogják megérteni az okok és okozatok láncolatának összefüggését, nem fogják megérteni a létcsírák kioltását, az érzelmek elvetését, a létszomj elfojtását, a szenvedély eltávoztatását, a nyugalmat, a nirvánát. Ha tehát hirdetni fogom a tant, és a többi ember nem érti meg tanításomat, csak baj háramlik belőle rám, fölösleges fáradság háramlik belőle rám.És ekkor ez az addig nem hallott vers ötlött fel a Magasztos előtt:Nehezen jöttem én is rá, másnak hiába mondanám.A gonoszság, a gyűlölség elzárja más elől a Tant.Ár ellen úszó, mély, titkos, alig látszó szikrányi fény;a gonoszság sötétsége nem hagyja megpillantani.Mikor a Magasztos mindezt végiggondolta, úgy döntött, hogy megmarad magányában, és nem fogja hirdetni a Tant.",

    "Si quieres conocer la verdad de la vida y la muerte, debes reflexionar continuamente sobre esto: en el universo solo hay una ley que no cambia nunca, la de que todas las cosas cambian y ninguna cosa es permanente.",
    "Los maestros taoístas huainan dicen: «No dejo que los cambios de un momento dado determinen cómo me domino a mí mismo. Lo que llamo dominio de mí mismo significa que mi naturaleza y mi vida permanecen en lugar seguro.»"
