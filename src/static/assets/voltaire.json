I except, always, El Dorado. I scarcely ever knew a city that did not desire the destruction of a neighbouring city, nor a family that did not wish to exterminate some other family.

Leo nuestros antiguos libros y ellos espesan todavía más mis tinieblas. Hablo con mis compañeros: los unos me responden que hay que gozar de la vida y burlarse de los hombres; los otros creen saber algo y se pierden en ideas extravagantes; todo aumenta el sentimiento doloroso que experimento.

Che questi errori non generino le nostre sventure. Tu non ci hai dato un cuore perché noi ci odiassimo, né delle mani perché ci scannassimo.

Possano tutti gli uomini ricordarsi che sono fratelli! Che essi abbiano in orrore la tirannide esercitata sugli animi, così come esecrano il brigantaggio che strappa con la forza il frutto del lavoro e dell’industria pacifica! Se i flagelli della guerra sono inevitabili, non odiamoci però, non laceriamoci a vicenda quando regna la pace e impieghiamo l’istante della nostra esistenza per benedire ugualmente, in mille lingue diverse, dal Siam sino alla California, la tua bontà che questo istante ci ha dato",

He entered Paris by the suburb of St. Marceau, and fancied that he was in the dirtiest village of Westphalia. Scarcely was Candide arrived at his inn, than he found himself attacked by a slight illness, caused by fatigue. As he had a very large diamond on his finger, and the people of the inn had taken notice of a prodigiously heavy box among his baggage, there were two physicians to attend him, though he had never sent for them, and two devotees who warmed his broths. \"I remember,\" Martin said, \"also to have been sick at Paris in my first voyage; I was very poor, thus I had neither friends, devotees, nor doctors, and I recovered.",

Throughout Italy we write only what we do not think; and the present inhabitants of the country of the Caesars and Antonines dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a Dominican father. I should be enamored of the spirit of the English nation, did it not utterly frustrate the good effects it would produce by passion and the spirit of party.”Candide, seeing a Milton, asked the senator if he did not think that author a great man. “Who?” said Pococurante sharply; “that barbarian who writes a tedious commentary in ten books of rumbling verse, on the first chapter of Genesis? that slovenly imitator of the Greeks, who disfigures the creation, by making the Messiah take a pair of compasses fromHeaven’s armory to plan the world; whereas Moses represented the Diety as producing the whole universe by his fiat? Can I think you have any esteem for a writer who has spoiled Tasso’s Hell and the Devil; who transforms Lucifer sometimes into a toad, and at others into apygmy; who makes him say the same thing over again a hundred times; who metamorphoses him into a school–divine; and who, by an absurdly serious imitation of Ariosto’s comic invention of firearms, represents the devils and angels cannonading each other in Heaven? Neither I nor any other Italian can possibly take pleasure in such melancholyreveries; but the marriage of Sin and Death, and snakes issuing from the womb of the former, are enough to make any person sick that is not lost to all sense of delicacy.

The only gospel we should read is the grand book of nature, written with God’s own hand, and stamped with his own seal. The only religion we ought to profess is, 'to adore God, and act like honest men.’ It would be as impossible for this simple and eternal religion to produce evil, as it would be impossible for Christian fanaticism not to produce it….

Andei quinhentas ou seiscentas léguas no Canadá; não encontrei um só monumento, ninguém ali sabe nada sobre o que fez o bisavô. Não seria este o estado natural do homem? A espécie humana deste continente parece-me superior à do outro. O seu ser tem aumentado de há muitos séculos para cá, graças às artes e aos conhecimentos. Será por terem barba na cara e Deus a ter negado aos americanos? Não o creio, porque os chineses não têm barba e cultivam as artes há mais de cinco mil anos. Com efeito, se eles têm mais de quatro mil anos de história, é necessário que a nação viva unida e florescente há mais de cinquenta séculos.O que mais me impressiona nesta antiga história da China é que tudo nela seja verosímil e natural. Admiro-a por nada ter de maravilhoso.Porque é que todas as nações se atribuem origens fabulosas? Os antigos cronistas da história da França, que ainda assim não são muito antigos, dizem que os franceses descendem de um Francus, filho de Heitor; os Romanos dizem-se originários de um frígio, conquanto não haja na língua deles uma só palavra que tenha a mais pequena relação com a língua frígia. Os deuses habitaram dez mil anos no Egipto e os diabos na Sítia, onde engendraram os Hunos. Antes de Tucídides, não vejo senão romanos parecidos com o Amadis e muito menos divertidos do que ele. Por toda a parte há aparições, oráculos, metamorfoses, sonhos explicados, sobre que assenta o destino dos maiores impérios e dos mais pequenos Estados. Aqui há animais que falam, além animais que se adoram, deuses transformados em homens e homens transformados em deuses. Ah!

He said to Pangloss and Martin: \"That good old man seems to me to have made himself a life far preferable to that of the six Kings with whom we had the honor of having supper.\"\"Great eminence,\" said Pangloss, \" is very dangerous, according to the report of all philosophers. For after all, Eglon, King of the Moabites, was assassinated by Ehud; Absolom was hanged by his hair and pierced with three darts; King Naab son of Jeroboam was killed by Baasha...\"\"I also know\", said Candide, \"that we must cultivate our garden.\"\"You are right,\" said Pangloss, \"for when man was put in the Garden of Eden, he was put there ut operaretur eum, to work; which proves that man was not born to rest.\"\"Let us work without reasoning,\" said Martin, \"it is the only way to make life endurable.\"All the little society entered into this laudable plan; each one began to exercise his talents. The little piece of land produced much. True, Cunégonde was very ugly; but she became and excellent pastry cook; Paquette embroidered; the old woman took care of the linen. No one, not even Friar Giroflée, failed to perform some service; he was a very good carpenter, and even became an honorable man; and Pangloss sometimes said to Candide: \"All events are linked together in the best of all possible worlds. for after all, if you had not been expelled from a fine castle with great kicks in the backside for love of Mademoiselle Cunégonde, if you had not been subjected to the Inquisition, if you had not traveled about America on foot, if you had not given the Baron a great blow with your sword, if you had not lost all your sheep from the good country of Eldorado, you would not be here eating candied citrons and pistachios.\"\"That is well said,\" replied Candide, \"but we must cultivate our garden.",

Paquette tenait ce present d’un Cordelier très savant qui avait remonté à la source, car il l’avait eu d’une vieille comtesse, qui l’avait reçu d’un capitaine de cavalerie, qui le devait à une marquise, qui le tenait d’un page, qui l’avait reçu d’un jésuite, qui, étant novice, l’avait eu en droite ligne d’un des compagnons de Christophe Colomb. Pour moi, je ne le donnerai à personne, car je me meurs.O Pangloss! s’écria Candide, voilà une étrange généalogie! n’est-ce pas le diable qui en fut la souche? Point du tout, répliqua ce grand home; c’était une chose indispensable dans le meilleur des mondes, un ingredient nécessaire; car si Colomb n’avait pas attrapé dans une île de l'Amérique cette maladie qui empoisonne la source de la generation, qui souvent meme empêche la generation, et qui est évidemment l’opposé du grand but de la nature, nous n’aurions ni le chocolat ni la cochenille; il faut encore observer que jusqu’aujourd’hui, dans notre continent, cette maladie nous est particulière, comme la controverse.",

    "— Учителю, дойдохме да те помолим да ни кажеш защо е било създадено това странно животно, човекът.— Защо се бъркаш в тези неща — му отвърна дервишът. — Твоя работа ли е?— Но, достопочтени отче — каза Кандид, — на земята има страшно много зло.— Какво значение има — каза дервишът — дали има зло или добро? Когато негово височество изпраща някой кораб в Египет, тревожи ли се той дали мишките в кораба се чувстват добре, или не?— Какво тогава трябва да правим? — запита Панглос.— Да мълчим — отвърна му дервишът.— Аз се надявах — каза Панглос — да побеседвам малко с тебе за последиците и причините, за най-добрия от възможните светове, за произхода на злото, за естеството на душата, за предвечната хармония.Като чу тези думи, дервишът му хлопна вратата под носа.Докато разговаряха с дервиша, пръсна се новината, че в Цариград удушили двама везири и главния мюфтия и набили на кол много техни приятели. В продължение на няколко часа тази трагедия предизвика голямо вълнение навсякъде. Завръщайки се в малкия чифлик, Панглос, Кандид и Мартен видяха един добродушен старец, който бе излязъл на прага си да подиша чист въздух под клоните на портокаловите дървета. Панглос, който обичаше не по-малко да разпитва, отколкото да спори, го запита как се казва мюфтията, когото са удушили.— Съвсем не зная — отговори човечецът — и никога не съм знаел името на никой мюфтия, нито на някой везир. Съвършено нищо не зная за случката, за която ми говорите. Предполагам, че изобщо онези, които се занимават с обществените дела, свършват понякога зле и че напълно заслужават съдбата си. Никога не любопитствам да зная какво става в Цариград, задоволявам се да изпращам там за продан плодовете на градината, която обработвам.След тези думи той покани чужденците в дома си. Двете му дъщери и двамата му сина им предложиха разни видове шербети, които те сами правеха, каймак, размесен с корички от захаросана китра, портокали, лимони, ананаси, фъстъци, кафе мока, в което нямаше никакъв примес от лошото кафе от Батавия и от островите. След това двете дъщери на този добър мюсюлманин намазаха с благовонни масла брадите на Кандид, Панглос и Мартен.— Вие сигурно имате прекрасни обширни земи — каза Кандид на турчина.— Имам само осемдесет декара — отговори турчинът. — Обработвам ги с децата си. Трудът ни пази от трите големи злини: отегчението, порока и нуждата.Завръщайки се в чифлика си, Кандид се отдаде на дълбоки разсъждения върху думите на турчина. Той каза на Панглос и на Мартен:— Този добър старец, струва ми се, си е създал живот, който е много по за предпочитане от съдбата на шестимата царе, с които ние имахме честта да вечеряме.— Както твърдят всички философи — каза Панглос, — величието е много опасно: Еглон, царят на моабитите, е бил убит от Ехуд. Авесалом е увиснал на косите си и е бил прободен с три копия. Цар Надаб, син на Иеровоам, е бил убит от Вааза. Цар Ела — от Самбри, Охозиас — от Иеху, Аталия — от Йойада, царете Иоаким, Иехония, Седекия били превърнати в роби.

Вие знаете…— Зная също — отвърна Кандид, — че трябва да работим градината си.— Прав сте — каза Панглос, — защото, когато човекът е бил поставен в райската градина, той е бил поставен там ut operatur eum, тоест за да я обработва, което показва, че човекът не е роден за почивка.— Да работим, без да умуваме — каза Мартен. — Това е единственият начин да направим живота поносим.Цялото малко общество се съгласи с това похвално намерение и всеки се залови да упражнява дарбите си; малкият къс земя носеше големи приходи.

Понякога Панглос казваше на Кандид:— В най-добрия от възможните светове всички събития са свързани, защото, ако вие не бяхте изгонен от един прекрасен замък с ритници по задника заради любовта ви към госпожица Кюнегонд, ако не бяхте изтезаван от Инквизицията, ако не бяхте обиколил Америка пеша, ако не бяхте пронизал със сабята си барона, ако не бяхте загубил всичките си овце, които получихте от чудесната страна Елдорадо, не щяхте да ядете тук захаросани китри и фъстъци.— Добре казано — отговаряше Кандид, — но трябва да работим градината си.",
    "He concerns himself so much, replied Martin, “in the affairs of this world that it is very probable he may be in me as well aseverywhere else; but I must confess, when I cast my eye on this globe, or rather globule, I cannot help thinking that God has abandoned it to some malignant being. I always except El Dorado. I scarce ever knew a city that did not wish the destruction of its neighboring city; nor afamily that did not desire to exterminate some other family. The poor in all parts of the world bear an inveterate hatred to the rich, even while they creep and cringe to them; and the rich treat the poor like sheep, whose wool and flesh they barter for money; a million of regimentedassassins traverse Europe from one end to the other, to get their bread by regular depredation and murder, because it is the most gentlemanlike profession.
