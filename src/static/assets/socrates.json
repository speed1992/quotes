But if you continue to seek truth, you will eventually be able to handle it better. In fact, you want more! It's true that many people around you now may think you are weird or even a danger to society, but you don't care.

Excellence then is a habit.","I know that I am intelligent, because I know that I know nothing.","No one can teach, if by teaching we mean the transmission of knowledge, in any mechanical fashion, from one person to another.

What is to become of them?","Obligation sends the children to bed on time, but love tucks the covers in around their necks and passes out kisses and hugs.

The happiest people on earth don't have the best of everything... they make the best of everything I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think.","Sometimes you have to let go to see if there was anything worth holding onto.","Better to do a little well, then a great deal badly.","The young people of today think of nothing but themselves.

First, those who manage well the circumstances they encounter day by day. Next, those who are decent and honorable in their intercourse with all men, bearing easily and good naturedly what is offensive in others and being as agreeable and reasonable to their associates as is humanly possible to be... those who hold their pleasures always under control and are not ultimately overcome by their misfortunes... those who are not spoiled by their successes, who do not desert their true selves but hold their ground steadfastly as wise and sober - minded men.","Four things belong to a judge: to hear courteously, to answer wisely, to consider soberly, and to decide impartially.","In childhood be modest, in youth temperate, in adulthood just, and in old age prudent.","Let the questions be the curriculum.","You never know a line is crooked unless you have a straight one to put next to it.","An envious man waxeth lean with the fatness of his neighbors.

You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom.","The tongue of a fool is the key of his counsel, which, in a wise man, wisdom hath in keeping.","If you can do only a little.

Right?","In order that the mind should see light instead of darkness, so the entire soul must be turned away from this changing world, until its eye can learn to contemplate reality and that supreme splendor which we have called the good.

But these glories are withheld from him who is guilty of self-neglect, for they are not wont to blaze forth unbidden.","If you want to be a good saddler, saddle the worst horse; for if you can tame one, you can tame all.","The noblest worship is to make yourself as good and as just as you can.","Listen not to a tale-bearer or slanderer, for he tells thee nothing out of good-will; but as he discovereth of the secrets of others, so he will of thine in turn.","To fear death, my friends, is only to think ourselves wise, without being wise: for it is to think that we know what we do not know. For anything that men can tell, death may be the greatest good that can happen to them: but they fear it as if they knew quite well that it was the greatest of evils. And what is this but that shameful ignorance of thinking that we know what we do not know?","I am quite ready to acknowledge . . . that I ought to be grieved at death, if I were not persuaded that I am going to other gods who are wise and good (of this I am as certain as I can be of any such matters), and to men departed who are better than those whom I leave behind. And therefore I do not grieve as I might have done, for I have good hope that there is yet something remaining for the dead.","To fear death is nothing other than to think oneself wise when one is not. For it is to think one knows what one does not know. No one knows whether death may not even turn out to be the greatest blessings of human beings. And yet people fear it as if they knew for certain it is the greatest evil.","The man who is truly wise knows that he knows very little.","Just as you ought not to attempt to cure eyes without head or head without body, so you should not treat body without soul.","Do you suppose that I should have lived as long as I have if I had moved in the sphere of public life, and conducting myself in that sphere like an honorable man, had always upheld the cause of right, and conscientiously set this end above all other things? Not by a very long way, gentlemen; neither would any other man.","The examined life is the only life worth living.","The duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener.","How many things I can do without!","The bad one is that way because of the ignorance, therefore he can be healed with wisdom.","Nothing is to be preferred before justice.","Get not your friends by bare compliments but by giving them sensible tokens of your love.","To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images.","I call that man idle who might be better employed.","Beloved Pan and all ye other gods who haunt this place, give me beauty in the inward soul; and may the outward and the inward man be one.","The Delphic Oracle said I was the wisest of all the Greeks. It is because that I alone, of all the Greeks, know that I know nothing.","Philebus was saying that enjoyment and pleasure and delight, and the class of feelings akin to them, are a good to every living being, whereas I contend, that not these, but wisdom and intelligence and memory, and their kindred, right opinion and true reasoning, are better and more desirable than pleasure","You think that upon the score of fore-knowledge and divining I am infinitely inferior to the swans. When they perceive approaching death they sing more merrily than before, because of the joy they have in going to the God they serve.","And the same things look bent and straight when seen in water and out of it, and also both concave and convex, due to the sight's being mislead by the colors, and every sort of confusion of this kind is plainly in our soul. And, then, it is because they take advantage of this affection in our nature that shadow painting, and puppeteering, and many other tricks of the kind fall nothing short of wizardry.","Since I am convinced that I wrong no one, I am not likely to wrong myself.","It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue (aka areté) every day...for the unexamined life is not worth living.","Our purpose in founding the city was not to make any one class in it surpassingly happy, but to make the city as a whole as happyas possible.","I prefer to be refuted than to refute, for it is a greater good for oneself to be freed from the greatest evil than to free another.","All men's souls are immortal, but the souls of the righteous are immortal and divine.","YOU ARE NOT ONLY GOOD TO YOURSELF, BUT THE CAUSE OF GOODNESS IN OTHERS","I have lived long enough to learn how much there is I can really do without....

What has happened to me now has not happened of itself, but it is clear to me that it was better for me to die now and to escape from trouble. That is why my divine sign did not oppose me at any point. So I am certainly not angry with those who convicted me, or with my accusers. Of course that was not their purpose when they accused and convicted me, but they thought they were hurting me, and for this they deserve blame.","Wisdom belongs in wonder.","I soon realized that poets do not compose their poems with knowledge, but by some inborn talent and by inspiration, like seers and prophets who also say many fine things without any understanding of what they say.","To be uncertain is to be uncomfortable, but to be certain is to be ridiculous.","The true Wisdom is in recognizing our own ignorance.","...one thing I am ready to fight for as long as I can, in word and act: that is, that we shall be better, braver and more active men if we believe it right to look for what we don't know than if we believe there is no point in looking because what we don't know we can never discover.","What a lot of things there are a man can do without.","Some have courage in pleasures, and some in pains: some in desires, and some in fears, and some are cowards under the same conditions.","The beginning is the most important part, especially when dealing with anything young and tender.","An honest man is always a child.\n[Lat., Semper bonus homo tiro est.]","God desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only.","The greatest of all mysteries is the man himself.","To know, is to know that you know nothing.","The right way to begin is to pay attention to the young, and make them just as good as possible.","If you will take my advice you will think little of Socrates, and a great deal more of truth.","Wonder is the beginning of all wisdom.","In my investigation in the service of the god I found that those who had the highest reputation were nearly the most deficient, while those who were thought to be inferior were more knowledgeable.","Neither I nor any other man should, on trial or in way, contrive to avoid death at any cost.","I only know that I know nothing","All that we know is nothing can be known.","If the whole world depends on today's youth, I can't see the world lasting another 100 years.","Virtue does not come from wealth, but wealth, and every other good thing which men have comes from virtue.","I only know how little I know","Wars and revolutions and battles are due simply and solely to the body and its desires.","The fewer our wants the more we resemble the Gods.","A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter, or any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he is a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter.","Creation is man's immortality and brings him nearest to the gods.","I have good hope that there is something remaining for the dead.","Athletics have become professionalized.","'Wars, factions, and fighting,' said Socrates as he looked forward from his last hour, 'have no other origin than this same body and its lusts...

Only the willing and true of heart will seek the betterment of many.","As for me, all I know is I know nothing.","One who is injured ought not to return the injury, for on no account can it be right to do an injustice.","Often when looking at a mass of things for sale, he would say to himself, 'How many things I have no need of!'","I am confident that there truly is such a thing as living again, that the living spring from the dead, and that the souls of the dead are in existence.","Nobody knows anything, but I, knowing nothing, am the smartest man in the world.","We are in fact convinced that if we are ever to have pure knowledge of anything, we must get rid of the body and contemplate things by themselves with the soul by itself. It seems, to judge from the argument, that the wisdom which we desire and upon which we profess to have set our hearts will be attainable only when we are dead and not in our lifetime.","But already it is time to depart, for me to die, for you to go on living; which of us takes the better course, is concealed from anyone except God.","I only wish that ordinary people had an unlimited capacity for doing harm; then they might have an unlimited power for doing good.","I know nothing but the certainty of my own ignorance.","Whoever would have his body supple, easy and healthful should learn to dance.","If thou continuous to take delight in idle argumentation thou mayest be qualified to combat with the sophists, but will never know how to live with men.","The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding death, but in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death.","Whenever a number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form.","In every sort of danger there are various ways of winning through, if one is ready to do and say anything whatever.","To live well and honorably and justly are the same thing.","I only know one thing, and that is I know nothing","Are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth, or the best possible state of your soul?","Marry a good woman, and be happy the rest of your life.

It is only too likely that neither of us has any knowledge to boast of; but he thinks that he knows something which he does not know, whereas I am quite conscious of my ignorance. At any rate it seems that I am wiser than he is to this small extent, that I do not think that I know what I do not know.","My divine sign indicates the future to me.","So you would rather suffer an injustice than do an injustice?","Thou shouldst eat to live; not live to eat.","[N]either in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way of escaping death. For often in battle there is no doubt that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death; and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing to say and do anything.

It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.","Know thyself.","Let him who would move the world first move himself.","Death may be the greatest of all human blessings.","Contentment is natural wealth, luxury is artificial poverty.","Employ your time in improving yourself by other men's writings so that you shall come easily by what others have labored hard for.","The only good is knowledge and the only evil is ignorance.","The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our separate ways, I to die, and you to live. Which of these two is better only God knows.","I am not an Athenian or a Greek, but a citizen of the world.\"[As quoted in Plutarch's Of Banishment]","I examined the poets, and I look on them as people whose talent overawes both themselves and others, people who present themselves as wise men and are taken as such, when they are nothing of the sort.From poets, I moved to artists. No one was more ignorant about the arts than I; no one was more convinced that artists possessed really beautiful secrets. However, I noticed that their condition was no better than that of the poets and that both of them have the same misconceptions. Because the most skillful among them excel in their specialty, they look upon themselves as the wisest of men. In my eyes, this presumption completely tarnished their knowledge. As a result, putting myself in the place of the oracle and asking myself what I would prefer to be — what I was or what they were, to know what they have learned or to know that I know nothing — I replied to myself and to the god: I wish to remain who I am.We do not know — neither the sophists, nor the orators, nor the artists, nor I— what the True, the Good, and the Beautiful are. But there is this difference between us: although these people know nothing, they all believe they know something; whereas, I, if I know nothing, at least have no doubts about it. As a result, all this superiority in wisdom which the oracle has attributed to me reduces itself to the single point that I am strongly convinced that I am ignorant of what I do not know.","We cannot live better than in seeking to become better.","We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.","understanding a question is half an answer","Life contains but two tragedies.

Everyone is fighting some kind of battle.","My friend...care for your psyche...know thyself, for once we know ourselves, we may learn how to care for ourselves\" -Socrates","The beginning of wisdom is the definition of terms.","Regard your good name as the richest jewel you can possibly be possessed of -- for credit is like fire; when once you have kindled it you may easily preserve it, but if you once extinguish it, you will find it an arduous task to rekindle it again. The way to a good reputation is to endeavor to be what you desire to appear.","He is richest who is content with the least, for content is the wealth of nature.","If all our misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence everyone must take an equal portion, most people would be content to take their own and depart.","Those who are hardest to love need it the most.","Children nowadays are tyrants.

I set myself to do you– each one of you, individually and in private– what I hold to be the greatest possible service. I tried to persuade each one of you to concern himself less with what he has than with what he is, so as to render himself as excellent and as rational as possible.","The mind is everything; what you think you become","Virtue does not come from wealth, but. . . wealth, and every other good thing which men have. . . comes from virtue.","He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god.","The misuse of language induces evil in the soul","There is no solution; seek it lovingly","Not life, but good life, is to be chiefly valued.","It is better to change an opinion than to persist in a wrong one.","God takes away the minds of poets, and uses them as his ministers, as he also uses diviners and holy prophets, in order that we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness, but that God himself is the speaker, and that through them he is conversing with us.","And therefore if the head and the body are to be well, you must begin by curing the soul; that is the first and essential thing. And the care of the soul, my dear youth, has to be effected by the use of certain charms, and these charms are fair words; and by them temperance is implanted in the soul, and where temperance comes and stays, there health is speedily imparted, not only to the head, but to the whole body.","The only thing I know is that I know nothing, and i am no quite sure that i know that.","One who is injured ought not to return the injury, for on no account can it be right to do an injustice; and it is not right to return an injury, or to do evil to any man, however much we have suffered from him.","Give me beauty in the inward soul; may the outward and the inward man be at one.","There is no greater evil one can suffer than to hate reasonable discourse.","Are you not ashamed of caring so much for the making of money and for fame and prestige, when you neither think nor care about wisdom and truth and the improvement of your soul?","Well, although I do not suppose that either of us know anything really beautiful & good, I am better off than he is- for he knows nothing & thinks that he knows; I neither know nor think that I know.","To express oneself badly is not only faulty as far as the language goes, but does some harm to the soul.","Intelligent individuals learn from every thing and every one; average people, from their experiences. The stupid already have all the answers.","My plainness of speech makes them hate me, and what is their hatred but a\tproof that I am speaking the truth.","One day, the old wise Socrates walks down the streets, when all of the sudden a man runs up to him \"Socrates I have to tell you something about your friend who...\"\"Hold up\" Socrates interrupts him \"About the story you're about to tell me, did you put it trough the three sieves?\"\"Three sieves?\" The man asks \"What three sieves?\"\"Let's try it\" Socrates says.\"The first sieve is the one of truth, did you examine what you were about to tell me if it is true?\" Socrates asks.\"Well no, I just overheard it\" The man says.\"Ah, well then you have used the second sieve, the sieve of good?\" Socrates asks \"Is it something good what you're about to tell me?\"\"Ehm no, on the contrary\" the man answers.\"Hmmm\" The wise man says \"Let's use the third sieve then, is it necessary to tell me what you're so exited about?\"\"No not necessary\" the man says.\"Well\" Socrates says with a smile \"If the story you're about to tell me isn't true, good or necessary, just forget it and don't bother me with it.","Do not trouble about those who practice philosophy, whether they are good or bad; but examine the thing itself well and carefully.

And not being ambitious they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment. And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office, not because they would, but because they cannot help — not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good. For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is at present…","The ancient Oracle said that I was the wisest of all the Greeks. It is because I alone, of all the Greeks, know that I know nothing.","Beauty is a short-lived tyranny","Are you not ashamed of heaping up the greatest amount of money and honour and reputation, and caring so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul?","Be true to thine own self","May the inward and outward man be as one.","I honor and love you: but why do you who are citizens of the great and mighty nation care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor And reputation, and so little amount wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul? Re you not ashamed of these?... I do nothing but go about persuading you all, not to take thought for your persons and your properties, but first and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given by more, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man.","An unconsidered life is not one worth living.","One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing'.","A system of morality which is based on relative emotional values is a mere illusion, a thoroughly vulgar conception which has nothing sound in it and nothing true.","Now the hour to part has come.

And, to the utmost of my power, I exhort all other men to do the same...

Is not this ignorance of a disgraceful sort, the ignorance which is the conceit that a man knows that he does not know? And in this respect only I believe myself to differ from men in general, and may perhaps claim to be wiser than they are: that whereas I know but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know...","I do believe that there are gods, and in a far higher sense than that in which any of my accusers believe in them.","The unexamined life is not worth living","God would seem to indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are not human, or the work of man, but divine and the work of God; and that the poets are only the interpreters of the Gods...","Mankind is made of two kinds of people: wise people who know they're fools, and fools who think they are wise.","Wisdom is knowing you know nothing","Remember, no human condition is ever permanent.

One must accept the fall of the dice and settle one's affairs accordingly-- in whatever way argument declares would be best. One must not behave like children who have stumbled and who hold on to the hurt place and spend their time in crying out; rather one must always habituate the soul to turn as quickly as possible to curing and setting aright what has fallen and is sick, doing away with lament by medicine.","Neither in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way of escaping death. For often in battle there is no doubt that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death; and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding death, but in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death.","How many things can I do without?","And a thing is not seen because it is visible, but\tconversely, visible because it is seen; nor is a thing led because\tit is in the state of being led, or carried because it is in the\tstate of being carried, but the converse of this. And now I think, Euthyphro, that my meaning will be intelligible; and my\tmeaning is, that any state of action or passion implies previous\taction or passion. It does not become because it is becoming,\tbut it is in a state of becoming because it becomes; neither\tdoes it suffer because it is in a state of suffering, but it is in a\tstate of suffering because it suffers. Do you not agree?","One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.","To fear death, gentlemen, is no other than to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know.  No one knows whether death may not be the greatest of all blessings for a man, yet men fear it as if they knew that it is the greatest of evils.  And surely it is the most blameworthy ignorance to believe that one knows what one does not know.  It is perhaps on this point and in this respect, gentlemen, that I differ from the majority of men, and if I were to claim that I am wiser than anyone in anything, it would be in this, that, as I have no adequate knowledge of things in the underworld, so I do not think I have.  I do know, however, that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man.  I shall never fear or avoid things of which I do not know, whether they may not be good rather than things that I know to be bad.","Smart people learn from everything and everyone, average people from their experiences, stupid people already have all the answers.","And the same things look bent and straight when seen in water and out of it, and also both concave and convex, due to the sight’s being mislead by the colors, and every sort of confusion of this kind is plainly in our soul. And, then, it is because they take advantage of this affection in our nature that shadow painting, and puppeteering, and many other tricks of the kind fall nothing short of wizardry.","It is not difficult to avoid death, gentlemen of the jury; it is much more difficult to avoid wickedness, for it runs faster than death.","Employ your time in improving yourself by other men's writings, so that you shall gain easily what others have labored hard for.","Do you feel no compunction, Socrates, at having followed a line of action which puts you in danger of the death penalty?'I might fairly reply to him, 'You are mistaken, my friend, if you think that a man who is worth anything ought to spend his time weighing up the prospects of life and death. He has only one thing to consider in performing any action--that is, whether he is acting rightly or wrongly, like a good man or a bad one.","Be as you wish to seem","The Only Thing I Know For Sure Is That I Know Nothing At All, For Sure","The really important thing is not live, but to live well.","A man who really fights for justice must lead a private, not a public, life if he is to survive for even a short time.","All I know is that I know nothing.","I don't know why I did it, I don't know why I enjoyed it, and I don't know why I'll do it again.","Nosce te ipsum","Everything is plainer when spoken than when unspoken.","Programming is not about what you know.

Is there not here conceit of knowledge, which is a disgraceful sort of ignorance? And this is the point in which, as I think, I am superior to men in general, and in which I might perhaps fancy myself wiser than other men, - that whereas I know but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know: but I do know that injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God or man, is evil and dishonorable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a certain evil.","As for me, all I know is that I know nothing.","I thought that as I had failed in the contemplation of true existence, I ought to be careful that I did not lose the eye of my soul; as people may injure their bodily eye by observing and gazing on the sun during an eclipse, unless they take the precaution of looking at the image reflected in the water, or in some similar medium. ...I was afraid that my soul might be blinded altogether if I looked at things with my eyes or tried by the help of my senses to apprehend them. And I thought that I had better had recourse to ideas, and seek in them truth in existence. I dare to say that the simile is not perfect--for I am far from admitting that he who contemplates existence through the medium of ideas, sees them only \"through a glass darkly,\" any more than he who sees them in their working and effects.","I pity those reviewers above, and people like them, who ridicule authors like R.A. Boulay and other proponents of similar Ancient Astronaut theories, simply for putting forth so many interesting questions (because that's really what he often throughout openly admits is all he does does) in light of fascinating and thought-provoking references which are all from copious sources.Some people will perhaps only read the cover and introduction and dismiss it as soon as any little bit of information flies in the face of their beliefs or normalcy biases. Some of those people, I'm sure, are some of the ones who reviewed this book so negatively without any constructive criticism or plausible rebuttal. It's sad to see how programmed and indoctrinated the vast majority of humanity has become to the ills of dogma, indoctrination, unverified status quos and basic ignorance; not to mention the laziness and conformity that results in such acquiescence and lack of critical thinking or lack of information gathering to confirm or debunk something. Too many people just take what's spoon fed to them all their lives and settle for it unquestioningly. For those people I like to offer a great Einstein quote and one of my personal favorites and that is:\"Condemnation without investigation is the highest form of ignorance\"I found this book to be a very interesting gathering of information and collection of obscure and/or remote antiquated information, i.e. biblical, sacred, mythological and otherwise, that we were not exactly taught to us in bible school, or any other public school for that matter. And I am of the school of thought that has been so for intended purposes.The author clearly cites all his fascinating sources and cross-references them rather plausibly. He organizes the information in a sequential manner that piques ones interest even as he jumps from one set of information to the next. The information, although eclectic as it spans from different cultures and time periods, interestingly ties together in several respects and it is this synchronicity that makes the information all the more remarkable.For those of you who continue to seek truth and enlightenment because you understand that an open mind makes for and lifelong pursuit of such things I leave you with these Socrates quotes:\"True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.","True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, & the world around us.","the great honor in the world is to be what we pretend to be","Conocerse a uno mismo, ese es el principio fundamental de la verdadera sabiduría Humana.","...each individual can only do one thing well.

Are you not ashamed of this?","Would that the majority could inflict the greatest evils, for they would then be capable of the greatest good, and that would be fine, but now they cannot do either. They cannot make a man either wise or foolish, but they inflict things haphazardly.","القناعة هي المصدر الحقيقي لأكبر لذة","The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways - I to die, and you to live.

The rhapsode like yourself and the actor are intermediate links, and the poet himself is the first of them. Through all these the God sways the souls of men in any direction which he pleases, and makes one man hang down from another. Thus there is a vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses, who are suspended, as if from the stone, at the side of the rings which hang down from the Muse. And every poet has some Muse from whom he is suspended, and by whom he is said to be possessed, which is nearly the \tIon 5same thing; for he is taken hold of.","I neither know nor think that I know","...[T]he really important thing is not to live, but to live well...

That is the meaning of true knowledge.","There is one way, then, in which a man can be free from all anxiety about the fate of his soul - if in life he has abandoned bodily pleasures and adornments, as foreign to his purpose and likely to do more harm than good, and has devoted himself to the pleasures of acquiring knowledge, and so by decking his soul not with a borrowed beauty but with its own - with self-control, and goodness, and courage, and liberality, and truth - has fitted himself to await his journey in the next world.","By all means, marry. If you get a good wife, you’ll become happy; if you get a bad one, you’ll become a philosopher.","I'm wiser than that person. For it's likely that neither of us knows anything fine and good, but he thinks he knows something he doesn't know, whereas I, since I don't in fact know, don't think that I do either. At any rate, it seems that I'm wiser than he in just this one small way: that what I don't know, I don't think I know.","Get not your friends by bare compliments, but by giving them sensible tokens of your love.","Is there not one true coin for which all things ought to exchange?- and that is wisdom; and only in exchange for this, and in company with this, is anything truly bought or sold, whether courage, temperance or justice. And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her? But the virtue which is made up of these goods, when they are severed from wisdom and exchanged with one another, is a shadow of virtue only, nor is there any freedom or health or truth in her; but in the true exchange there is a purging away of all these things, and temperance, and justice, and courage, and wisdom herself, are a purgation of them.","The definition of terms is the beginning of wisdom.","It is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong","...a good man cannot be harmed either in life or in death, and that his affairs are not neglected by the gods.","By all means marry.

Well, supposing, as I said, that you should offer to acquit me on these terms, I should reply 'Gentlemen, I am your very grateful and devoted servant, but I owe a greater obedience to God than to you; and so long as I draw breath and have my faculties, I shall never stop practicing philosophy and exhorting you and elucidating the truth for everyone that I meet. I shall go on saying, in my usual way, \"My very good friend, you are an Athenian and belong to a city which is the greatest and most famous in the world for its wisdom and strength.

I shall do this to everyone that I meet, young or old, foreigner or fellow-citizen; but especially to you my fellow-citizens, inasmuch as you are closer to me in kinship. This, I do assure you, is what my God commands; and it is my belief that no greater good has ever befallen you in this city than my service to my God; for I spend all my time going about trying to persuade you, young and old, to make your first and chief concern not for your bodies nor for your possessions, but for the highest welfare of your souls, proclaiming as I go 'Wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing, both to the individual and to the State.' ...And so, gentlemen, I would say, 'You can please yourselves whether you listen to Anytus or not, and whether you acquit me or not; you know that I am not going to alter my conduct, not even if I have to die a hundred deaths.","Human nature will not easily find a better helper than eros","..Do we have not choice but to agree that in each of us are found the same elements and characteristics as are found in the city?

If death were a release from everything, it would be a boon for the wicked. But since the soul is clearly immortal, it can have no escape or security from evil except by becoming as good and wise as it possibly can. For it takes nothing with it to the next world except its education and training: and these, we are told, are of supreme importance in helping or harming the newly dead at the very beginning of his journey there.","So I withdrew and thought to myself: 'I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something when he does not, whereas when I do not know, neither do I think I know; so I am likely to be wiser than he to this small extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know.","I am likely to be wiser than he to this small, extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know","Two things greater than all the things are.On is love and the other is war.","I am likely to be wiser than he to this small, extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know.","A man who preserves his integrity no real, long-lasting harm can ever come.","He who is not content with what he has will not be content with what he would like to have.","Is something good because the gods approve of it?

But perhaps someone will say 'Do you feel no compunction, Socrates, at having followed a line of action which puts you in danger of the death-penalty?' I might fairly reply to him 'You are mistaken, my friend, if you think that a man who is worth anything ought to spend his time weighing up the prospects of life and death.

In other discussions it has often checked me in the middle of a sentence; but this time it has never opposed me in any part of this business in anything that I have said or done. What do I suppose to be the explanation? I will tell you. I suspect that this thing that has happened to me is a blessing, and we are quite mistaken in supposing death to be an evil. I have good grounds for thinking this, because my accustomed sign could not have failed to oppose me if what I was doing had not been sure to bring some good result.","wonder is the beginning of wisdom","Sólo sé que no sé nada.","My method is to call in support of my statements the evidence of a single witness, the man I am arguing with, and to take his vote alone; the rest of the world are nothing to me; I am not talking to them.","Doing good is a matter of looking after the part of yourself which matters most, namely your soul","...[M]en are put in a sort of guard-post, from which one must not release one's self or run away...","One thing that I know, is that I know nothing.","If I save my insight, I don’t attend to weakness of eyesight.","I would rather die having spoken after my manner, than speak in your manner and live.","Do we say that one must never willingly do wrong, or does it depend upon the circumstances?

Whatever the popular view is, and whether the alternative in pleasanter than the present one or even harder to bear, the fact remains that to do wrong is in every sense bad and dishonourable for the person who does it.","Do you imagine that a city can continue to exist and not be turned upside down, if the legal judgments which are pronounced in it have no force but are nullified and destroyed by private persons?","Homme, connais-toi toi-même!","If the soul is immortal, it demands our care not only for that part of time which we call life, but for all time; and indeed it would seem now that it will be extremely dangerous to neglect it.

Şi dacă în moarte nu-i nici o simţire, ci este aşa ca un somn adânc, când cineva doarme fără măcar să aibă un vis, atunci moartea se înfăţişează ca un minunat câştig. Căci eu socotesc că dacă şi-ar alege cineva o noapte în care a dormit aşa de bine că n-a fost tulburat nici măcar de un vis, dacă apoi ar compara acea noapte cu toate celelalte nopţi şi zile ale vieţii sale şi, cercetându-le întru sine, ar trebui să spună câte zile şi câte nopţi din viaţa lui a trăit mai liniştit şi mai plăcut decât în noaptea aceea, socotesc că nu numai un om de rând, dar însuşi Marele Rege ar găsi că acestea sunt prea puţine la număr faţă de celelalte zile şi nopţi.Dacă moartea este aşa ceva, eu o numesc câştig. Căci atunci întreaga veşnicie nu pare a fi altceva decât o singură noapte senină. Dacă însă moartea este ca şi o călătorie de aici în alt loc, dacă sunt adevărate cele ce se spun, că acela este locul de întâlnire al tuturor care au murit, atunci ce bine s-ar putea închipui mai mare decât moartea, o, judecătorii mei?","Let us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great reason to hope that death is a good; for one of two things—either death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another. Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private man, but even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single night. But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this? If indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world below, he is delivered from the professors of justice in this world, and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there, Minos and Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were righteous in their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth making. What would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again.","Virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man, public as well as private.","Anyone who’s really fighting for justice must live as a private citizen and not as a public figure if he’s going to survive even a short time.","God only is wise.","ὁ ... ἀνεξέταστος βίος οὐ βιωτὸς ἀνθρώπῳ... An unexamined life is not worth living","...I do not believe that the law of God permits a better man to be harmed by a worse. No doubt my accuser might put me to death or have me banished or deprived of civic rights; but even if he thinks, as he probably does (and others to, I dare say), that these are great calamities, I do not think so... For let me tell you, gentlemen, that to be afraid of death is only another form of thinking that one is wise when one is not; it is to think that one knows what one does not know. No one knows with regard to death whether it is not really the greatest blessing that can happen to a man; but people dread it as though they were certain that it is the greatest evil; and this ignorance, which thinks that it knows what it does not, must surely be ignorance most culpable. This, I take it, gentlemen, is the degree, and this is the nature of my advantage over the rest of mankind; and if I were to claim to be wiser than my neighbour in any respect, it would be in this: that not possessing any real knowledge of what comes after death, I am also conscious that I do not possess it. But I do know that to do wrong and to disobey my superior, whether God or man, is wicked and dishonourable; and so I shall never feel more fear or aversion for something which, for all I know, may really be a blessing, than for those evils which I know to be evils.","Make Athens Think Again.","...I do not think that it is right for a man to appeal to the jury or to get himself acquitted by doing so; he ought to inform them of the facts and convince them by argument. The jury does not sit to dispense justice as a favour, but to decide where justice lies; and the oath which they have sworn is not to show favour at their own discretion, but to return a just and lawful verdict... Therefore you must not expect me, gentlemen, to behave towards you in a way which I consider neither reputable nor moral nor consistent with my religious duty.","...[T]hese people... are my dangerous accusers; because those who hear them suppose that anyone who inquires into such matters... theories about the heavens... and everything below the earth... must be an atheist.","Time is endless when it is purposeful.","...[I]n any inquiry you are likely to attain more nearly to knowledge of your object in proportion to the care and accuracy with which you have prepared yourself to understand that object in itself[.]","I went to interview a man with a high reputation for wisdom, because I felt that here if anywhere I should succeed in disproving the oracle and pointing out to my divine authority 'You said that I was the wisest of men, but here is a man who is wiser than I am.' Well, I gave a thorough examination to this person... and in conversation with him I formed the impression that although in many people's opinion, and especially in his own, he appeared to be wise, in fact he was not. Then when I began to try to show him that he only thought he was wise and was not really so, my efforts were resented both by him and by many of the other people present. However, I reflected as I walked away: 'Well, I am certainly wiser than this man. It is only too likely that neither of us has any knowledge to boast of; but he thinks that he knows something which he does not know, whereas I am quite conscious of my ignorance. At any rate it seems that I am wiser than he is to this small extent, that I do not think that I know what I do not know... [A]s I pursued my investigation at the god's command,... my honest impression was... that the people with the greatest reputations were almost entirely deficient, while others who were supposed to be their inferiors were much better qualified in practical intelligence.","...[I]f at the time of its release the soul is tainted and impure, because it has always associated with the body and cared for it and loved it, and has been so beguiled by the body and its passions and pleasures that nothing seems real to it but those physical things which can be touched and seen and eaten and drunk and used for sexual enjoyment; and if it is accustomed to hate and fear and avoid what is invisible and hidden from our eyes, but intelligible and comprehensible by philosophy - if the soul is in this state, do you think that it will escape independent and uncontaminated?","...[T]hose who care about their souls and do not subordinate them to the body dissociate themselves firmly from these others and refuse to accompany them on their haphazard journey; and, believing that it is wrong to oppose philosophy with her offer of liberation and purification, they turn and follow her wherever she leads...","Să te temi de moarte, cetăţeni, nu este nimic altceva decât să-ţi închipui că eşti înţelept fără să fii, înseamnă să crezi că ştii ceea ce nu ştii. Căci nimeni nu ştie ce este moartea şi nici dacă nu e cumva cel mai mare bine pentru om, dar toţi se tem de ea ca şi cum ar fi siguri că e cel mai mare rău. Iar acest fel de a gândi cum să nu fie tocmai prostia aceea vrednică de dispreţ - de a crede că ştii ceea ce nu ştii? Eu însă, atenieni, poate că tocmai prin aceasta şi în acest punct mă deosebesc de cei mai mulţi (chiar dacă ar însemna să spun că într-o privinţă sunt mai înţelept decât altul), şi anume că, dacă nu ştiu mare lucru despre cele din Hades, îmi şi dau seama că nu ştiu.","Perhaps someone may say 'But surely, Socrates, after you have left us you can spend the rest of your life in quietly minding your own business.' This is the hardest thing of all to make some of you understand. If I say that this would be disobedience to God, and that is why I cannot 'mind my own business', you will not believe that I am serious. If on the other hand I tell you that to let no day pass without discussing goodness and all the other subjects about which you hear me talking and examining both myself and others is really the best thing that a man can do, and that life without this sort of examination is not worth living, you will be even less inclined to believe me. Nevertheless, that is how it is, gentlemen, as I maintain; though it is not easy to convince you of it.","Αλιμονο σε αυτους που δεν ξερουν οτι δεν ξερουν αυτα που δεν ξερουν","Pues bien, cuando alguien se da a lamúsica y deja que le inunde el alma derramando por sus oídos, como por un canal, aquellasdulces, suaves y lastimeras armonías de quehablábamos hace poco y pasa su vida enteraentre gorjeos y goces musicales, esta personacomienza por templar, como el fuego al hierro,la fogosidad que pueda albergar su espíritu yhacerla útil de dura e inservible.

It follows that bad people ultimately harm only themselves: nothing can harm a good man either in life or after death","For I go around doing nothing but persuading both young and old among you not to care for your body or your wealth in preference to or as strongly as for the best possible state of your soul, as I say to you: Wealth does no bring about excellence, but excellence makes wealth and everything else good for men, both individually and collectively","It looks as if I was cleverer than Daedalus in using my skill, my friend, insofar as he could only cause to move the things he made himself, but I can make other people’s move as well as my own. And the smartest part of my skill is that I am clever without wanting to be, for I would rather have your statements to me remain unmoved than possess the wealth of Tantalus as well as the cleverness of Daedalus","The more I know, the more I know nothing.","La vista del entendimiento, ten por cierto, empieza a ver adecuadamente cuando la de los ojos comienza a perder su fuerza.","Si pensáis que matando a la gente vais a impedir que se os reproche que no vivís rectamente, no pensáis bien.
