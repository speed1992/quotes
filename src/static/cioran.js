    "What do you do from morning to night?\" \"I endure myself.",
    "How important can it be that I suffer and think? My presence in this world will disturb a few tranquil lives and will unsettle the unconscious and pleasant naiveté of others. Although I feel that my tragedy is the greatest in history - greater than the fall of empires - I am nevertheless aware of my total insignificance. I am absolutely persuaded that I am nothing in this universe; yet I feel that mine is the only real existence.",
    "What does the future, that half of time, matter to the man who is infatuated with eternity?",
    "Consider love: is there a nobler outpouring, a rapture less suspect? Its shudders rival music, compete with the tears of solitude and of ecstasy: sublime...but a sublimity inseperable from the urinary tract: transports bordering upon excretion, a heaven of the glands, sudden sancitity of the orifices. It takes no more than a moment of attention for this intoxication, shaken, to cast you back into the ordures of physiology or a moment of fatigue to recognize that so much ardor produces only a variety of mucous.",
    "Chaos is rejecting all you have learned, chaos is being yourself.",
    "It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late.",
    "Trees are massacred, houses go up — faces, faces everywhere. Man is spreading. Man is the cancer of the earth.",
    "What I know at sixty, I knew as well at twenty. Forty years of a long, superfluous, labor of verification.",
    "I don’t understand why we must do things in this world, why we must have friends and aspirations, hopes and dreams. Wouldn’t it be better to retreat to a faraway corner of the world, where all its noise and complications would be heard no more? Then we could renounce culture and ambitions; we would lose everything and gain nothing; for what is there to be gained from this world?",

    "How good would it be if one could die by throwing oneself into an infinite void.",
    "I am the beast with a contorted grin, contracting down to illusion and dilating toward infinity, both growing and dying, delightfully suspended between hope for nothing and despair of everything, brought up among perfumes and poisons, consumed with love and hatred, killed by lights and shadows. My symbol is death of light and the flame of death. Sparks die in me only to be reborn as thunder and lightning. Darkness itself glows in me.",

    "We would not be interested in human beings if we did not have the hope of someday meeting someone worse off than ourselves.",
    "Much more than our other needs and endeavors, it is sexuality that puts us on an even footing with our kind: the more we practice it, the more we become like everyone else: it is in the performance of a reputedly bestial function that we prove our status as citizens: nothing is more public than the sexual act.",

    "You cannot protect your solitude if you cannot make yourself odious.",
    "As far as I am concerned, I resign from humanity. I no longer want to be, nor can still be, a man. What should I do? Work for a social and political system, make a girl miserable? Hunt for weaknesses in philosophical systems, fight for moral and esthetic ideals? It’s all too little. I renounce my humanity even though I may find myself alone. But am I not already alone in this world from which I no longer expect anything?",

    "There was a time when time did not yet exist.",
    "Paradise was unendurable, otherwise the first man would have adapted to it; this world is no less so, since here we regret paradise or anticipate another one. What to do? Where to go? Do nothing and go nowhere, easy enough.",
    "I have all the defects of other people yet everything they do seems to me inconceivable.",
    "Whenever I happen to be in a city of any size, I marvel that riots do not break out everyday: Massacres, unspeakable carnage, a doomsday chaos. How can so many human beings coexist in a space so confined without hating each other to death?",

    "Death makes no sense except to people who have passionately loved life. How can one die without having something to part from? Detachment is a negation of both life and death. Whoever has overcome his fear of death has also triumphed over life. For life is nothing but another word for this fear.",

    "Utopia is a mixture of childish rationalism and secularized angelism.",
    "No matter which way we go, it is no better than any other. It is all the same whether you achieve something or not, have faith or not, just as it is all the same whether you cry or remain silent.",
    "The obsession with suicide is characteristic of the man who can neither live nor die, and whose attention never swerves from this double impossibility.",
    "We derive our vitality from our store of madness.",

    "For you who no longer possess it, freedom is everything, for us who do, it is merely an illusion.",
    "History is nothing but a procession of false Absolutes, a series of temples raised to pretexts, a degradation of the mind before the Improbable.",
    "Ideas should be neutral. But man animates them with his passions and folly. Impure and turned into beliefs, they take on the appearance of reality. The passage from logic is consummated. Thus are born ideologies, doctrines, and bloody farce.",
    "Thinking should be like musical meditation. Has any philosopher pursued a thought to its limits the way Bach or Beethoven develop and exhaust a musical theme? Even after having read the most profound thinkers, one still feels the need to begin anew. Only music gives definitive answers.",
    "If truth were not boring, science would have done away with God long ago. But God as well as the saints is a means to escape the dull banality of truth.",
    "We rightly scorn those who have no made use of their defects, who have not exploited their deficiencies, and have not been enriched by their losses, as we despise any man who does not suffer at being a man or simply at being. Hence no graver insult can be inflicted than to call someone 'happy', no greater flattery than to grant him a 'vein of melancholy'... This is because gaiety is link to no important action and because, except for the mad, no one laughs when he is alone.",

    "Hungarian Language — savage it may be but of a beauty that has nothing human about it, with sonorities of another universe, powerful and corrosive, appropriate to prayer, to groans and to tears, risen out of hell to perpetuate its accent and its aura…words of nectar and cyanide.",
    "A distant enemy is always preferable to one at the gate.",
    "The curtain of the universe is moth-eaten, and through its holes we see nothing now but mask and ghost.",
    "There is not much difference between a mortal man and a dying man. The absurdity of making plans is only slightly more obvious in the second case.",
    "Let us not be needlessly bitter: certain failures are sometimes fruitful.",
    "Nothing sweeter than to drag oneself along behind events; and nothing more reasonable. But without a strong dose of madness, no initiative, no enterprise, no gesture. Reason: the rust of our vitality. It is the madman in us who forces us to adventure; once he abandons us, we are lost; everything depends on him, even our vegetative life; it is he who invites us, who obliges us to breathe, and it is also he who forces our blood to venture through our veins. Once he withdraws, we are alone indeed! We cannot be normal and alive at the same time.",
    "To Live signifies to believe and hope - to lie and to lie to oneself.",
    "I try--without success--to stop finding reasons for vanity in anything. When I happen to manage it nonetheless, I feel that I no longer belong to the mortal gang. I am above everything then, above the gods themselves. Perhaps that is what death is: a sensation of great, of extreme superiority.",
    "We dread the future only when we are not sure we can kill ourselves when we want to.",
    "One is and remains a slave as long as one is not cured of hoping.",
    "I live only because it is in my power to die when I choose to: without the idea of suicide, I'd have killed myself right away.",
    "Normal people have nothing to forget.",
    "To live... in any sense of the word... is to reject others; to accept them, one must renounce, do oneself violence.",
    "Life inspires more dread than death - it is life which is the great unknown.",
    "Since all life is futility, then the decision to exist must be the most irrational of all.",
    "He who hates himself is not humble.",
    "There is only one thing worse than boredom, and that is the fear of boredom.",
    "The desire to die was my one and only concern; to it I have sacrificed everything, even death.",
    "You are done for - a living dead man - not when you stop loving but stop hating. Hatred preserves: in it, in its chemistry, resides the mystery of life.",
    "Alone, even doing nothing, you do not waste your time. You do, almost always, in company. No encounter with yourself can be altogether sterile: Something necessarily emerges, even if only the hope of some day meeting yourself again.",
    "There was a time when time did not yet exist. … The rejection of birth is nothing but the nostalgia for this time before time.",
    "Wisdom disguises our wounds; it teaches us how to bleed in secret.",
    "I do nothing, granted. But I see the hours pass - which is better than trying to fill them.",
    "Consciousness is nature's nightmare.",
    "By what aberration has suicide, the only truly normal action, become the attribute of the flawed?",
    "Where are my sensations? They have melted into... me, and what is this me, this self, but the sum of these evaporated sensations?",
    "A decadent civilization compromises with its disease, cherishes the virus infecting it, loses its self-respect.",
    "Write books only if you are going to say in them the things you would never dare confide to anyone.",
    "My mission is to suffer for all those who suffer without knowing it. I must pay for them, expiate their unconsciousness, their luck to be ignorant of how unhappy they are.",
    "Never to have occasion to take a position, to make up one's mind, or to define oneself - there is no wish I make more often.",
    "Beware of thinkers whose minds function only when they are fueled by a quotation.",
    "I do not forgive myself for being born. It is as if creeping into this world, I had profaned a mystery, betrayed some momentous pledge, committed a fault of nameless gravity.",
    "No one should forget: Eros alone can fulfill life; knowledge, never. Only Eros makes sense; knowledge is empty infinity; – for thoughts, there is always time; life has its time; there is no thought that comes too late; any desire can become a regret.",
    "If I were to be totally sincere, I would say that I do not know why I live and why I do not stop living. The answer probably lies in the irrational character of life which maintains itself without reason.",
    "Time is heavy sometimes; imagine how heavy eternity must be.",
    "One does not inhabit a country; one inhabits a language. That is our country, our fatherland - and no other.",
    "It is because we are all impostors that we endure each other. The man who does not consent to lie will see the earth shrink under his feet: we are biologically obliged to the false",
    "A regret understood by no one: the regret to be a pessimist. It’s not easy to be on the wrong foot with life.",
    "To live in any true sense of the word is to reject others; to accept them, one must be able to renounce, to do oneself violence, to act against one's own nature, to weaken oneself; we conceive freedom only for ourselves - we extend it to our neighbours only at the cost of exhausting efforts; whence the precariousness of liberalism, a defiance of our instincts, a brief and miraculous success, a state of exception, at the antipodes of our deepest imperatives.",
    "If each of us were to confess his most secret desire, the one that inspires all his plans, all his actions, he would say: \"I want to be praised.\"",
    "After having struggled madly to solve all problems, after having suffered on the heights of despair, in the supreme hour of revelation, you will find that the only answer, the only reality, is silence.",
    "When we cannot be delivered from ourselves, we delight in devouring ourselves.",
    "Society: an inferno of saviors!",
    "Life is merely a fracas on an unmapped terrain, and the universe a geometry stricken with epilepsy.",
    "Espousing the melancholy of ancient symbols, I would have freed myself.",
    "We must learn how to explode! Any disease is healthier than the one provoked by a hoarded rage.",
    "Psychoanalysis is a technique we practice at our cost; psychoanalysis degrades our risks, our dangers, our depths; it strips us of our impurities, of all that made us curious about ourselves.",
    "The truly solitary being is not the man who is abandoned by men, but the man who suffers in their midst, who drags his desert through the marketplace and deploys his talents as a smiling leper, a mountebank of the irreparable.",
    "One cannot live without motives. I have no motives left, and I am living.",
    "What surrounds us we endure better for giving it a name - and moving on.",
    "Wherever we go, we come up against the human, a repulsive ubiquity before which we fall into stupor and revolt, a perplexity on fire.",
    "Between Ennui and Ecstasy unwinds our whole experience of time.",
    "Anyone can escape into sleep, we are all geniuses when we dream, the butcher's the poet's equal there.",
    "Transmitting one's flaws [through procreation] to someone else is a crime. I could never consent to give life to someone who would inherent my ailments.",

    "The universal view melts things into a blur.",
    "What are you waiting for in order to give up?",
    "Self-conscious rejection of the absolute is the best way to resist God; thus illusion, the substance of life, is saved.",

    "Everything is pathology, except for indifference.",
    "Tears do not burn except in solitude.",
    "Skepticism is the sadism of embittered souls.",
    "As long as one believes in philosophy, one is healthy; sickness begins when one starts to think.",

    "Were we to undertake an exhaustive self-scrutiny, disgust would paralyze us, we would be doomed to a thankless existence.",
    "Glory - once achieved, what is it worth?",
    "If we had the courage to confront the doubts we timidly conceive about ourselves, none of us would utter an 'I' without shame.",
    "I lost my sleep, and this is the greatest tragedy that can befall someone. It is much worse than sitting in prison.",
    "Good health is the best weapon against religion. Healthy bodies and healthy minds have never been shaken by religious fears.",
    "The refutation of suicide: is it not inelegant to abandon a world which has so willingly put itself at the service of our melancholy?",
    "To read is to let someone else work for you - the most delicate form of exploitation.",

    "Jealousy - that jumble of secret worship and ostensible aversion.",
    "We are all geniuses when we dream.",
    "There is no other world. Nor even this one. What, then, is there? The inner smile provoked in us by the patent nonexistence of both.",
    "To live entirely without a goal! I have glimpsed this state, and have often attained it, without managing to remain there: I am too weak for such happiness.",
    "Humanity adores only those who cause it to perish.",
    "No one can keep his griefs in their prime; they use themselves up.",
    "All that shimmers on the surface of the world, all that we call interesting, is the fruit of ignorance and inebriation.",
    "To get up in the morning, wash and then wait for some unforeseen variety of dread or depression. I would give the whole universe and all of Shakespeare for a grain of ataraxy.",
    "To claim you are more detached, more alien to everything than anyone, and to be merely a fanatic of indifference!",
    "True moral elegance consists in the art of disguising one's victories as defeats.",
    "Everything turns on pain; the rest is accessory, even nonexistent, for we remember only what hurts. Painful sensations being the only real ones, it is virtually useless to experience others.",
    "I was walking late one night along a tree-lined path; a chestnut fell at my feet. The noise it made as it burst, the resonance it provoked in me, and an upheaval out of all proportion to this insignificant event thrust me into miracle, into the rapture of the definitive, as if there were no more questions-only answers. I was drunk on a thousand unexpected discoveries, none of which I could make use of. ... This is how I nearly reached the Supreme. But instead I went on with my walk.",
    "Man started out on the wrong foot. The misadventure in paradise was the first consequence. The rest had to follow.",
    "Discretion is deadly to genius; ruinous to talent.",
    "Music is the refuge of souls ulcerated by happiness.",
    "Each of us is born with a share of purity, predestined to be corrupted by our commerce with mankind, by that sin against solitude.",
    "The importance of insomnia is so colossal that I am tempted to define man as the animal who cannot sleep. Why call him a rational animal when other animals are equally reasonable? But there is not another animal in the entire creation that wants to sleep yet cannot.",
    "History proves nothing because it contains everything.",
    "Basis of society: anonymous sweat.",
    "True confessions are written with tears only. But my tears would drown the world, as my inner fire would reduce it to ashes.",
    "It has been a long time since philosophers have read men's souls. It is not their task, we are told. Perhaps. But we must not be surprised if they no longer matter much to us.",
    "Ideas come as you walk, Nietzsche said.  Walking dissipates thoughts, Shankara taught.",
    "No human beings are more dangerous than those who have suffered for a belief",
    "An individual dies ... when, instead of taking risks and hurling himself toward being, he cowers within, and takes refuge there.",

    "We die in proportion to the words we fling around us.",

    "In order to have the stuff of a tyrant, a certain mental derangement is necessary.",
    "Far from diminishing the appetite for power, suffering exasperates it.",
    "Tyranny destroys or strengthens the individual; freedom enervates him, until he becomes no more than a puppet. Man has more chances of saving himself by hell than by paradise.",
    "Think of God and not religion, of ecstasy and not mysticism. The difference between the theoretician of faith and the believer is as great as between the psychiatrist and the psychotic.",
    "Speech and silence. We feel safer with a madman who talks than with one who cannot open his mouth.",
    "Society is not a disease, it is a disaster. What a stupid miracle that one can live in it.",

    "Word - that invisible dagger.",
    "The fear of being deceived is the vulgar version of the quest for Truth.",
    "We have convictions only if we have studied nothing thoroughly.",
    "The reaction against your own thought in itself lends life to thought. How this reaction is born is hard to describe, because it identifies with the very rare intellectual tragedies. The tension, the degree and level of intensity of a thought proceeds from its internal antinomies, which in turn are derived from the unsolvable contradictions of a soul. Thought cannot solve the contradictions of the soul. As far as linear thinking is concerned, thoughts mirror themselves in other thoughts, instead of mirroring a destiny.",
    "To think is to take a cunning revenge in which we camouflage our baseness and conceal our lower instincts.",
    "Our works, whatever they may be, derive from our incapacity to kill or to kill ourselves.",

    "Each of us must pay for the slightest damage he inflicts upon a universe created for indifference and stagnation, sooner or later, he will regret not having left it intact.",
    "Tolerance cannot seduce the young.",
    "What to think of other people? I ask myself this question each time I make a new acquaintance. So strange does it seem to me that we exist, and that we consent to exist.",

In such moments you will be severed from life, from love, smiles, friends and even from death. And you will ask yourself if there is anything besides the nothingness of the world and your own nothingness.",
    "Tragic paradox of freedom: the mediocre men who alone make its exercise possible cannot guarantee its duration.",
    "The task of the solitary man is to be even more solitary.",
    "We cannot consent to be judged by someone who has suffered less than ourselves. And since each of us regards himself as an unrecognized Job.",
    "As art sinks into paralysis, artists multiply. This anomaly ceases to be one if we realize that art, on its way to exhaustion, has become both impossible and easy.",
    "Mind, even more deadly to empires than to individuals, erodes them, compromises their solidity.",

    "I seem to myself, among civilized men, an intruder, a troglodyte enamored of decrepitude, plunged into subversive prayers.",

    "God: a disease we imagine we are cured of because no one dies of it nowadays.",
    "Every word affords me pain. Yet how sweet it would be if I could hear what the flowers have to say about death!",
    "The more intense a spiritual leader's appetite for power, the more he is concerned to limit it to others.",
    "To hope is to contradict the future.",
    "Every thought should recall the ruin of a smile.",

    "Vague a l'ame - melancholy yearning for the end of the world.",
    "The premonition of madness is complicated by the fear of lucidity in madness, the fear of the moments of return and reunion... One would welcome chaos if one were not afraid of lights in it.",
    "The source of our actions resides in an unconscious propensity to regard ourselves as the center, the cause, and the conclusion of time. Our reflexes and our pride transform into a planet the parcel of flesh and consciousness we are.",
    "By all evidence we are in the world to do nothing; but instead of nonchalantly promenading our own corruption, we exude our sweat and grow winded upon the fetid air.",
    "Consciousness is much more than the thorn, it is the dagger in the flesh.",
    "Knowledge, having irritated and stimulated our appetite for power, will lead us inexorably to our ruin.",

    "I foresee the day when we shall read nothing but telegrams and prayers.",
    "Nothing is so wearing as the possession or abuse of liberty.",
    "It is an understatement to say that in this society injustices abound: in truth, it is itself the quintessence of injustice.",

    "Utopia is the grotesque en rose, the need to associate happiness - that is, the improbable - with becoming, and to coerce an optimistic, aerial vision to the point where it rejoins its own source: the very cynicism it sought to combat. In short, a monstrous fantasy.",
    "No one can do without some semblance of immortality, and even less will they deny themselves the right to seek it out in the form of this or that reputation, starting with the literary...  Since death has come to be accepted by all as the absolute end, everyone writes.",
