Rarely is suicide committed (yet the hypothesis is not excluded) through reflection. What sets off the crisis is almost always unverifiable.

But one would have to know whether a friend of the desperate man had not that very day addressed him indifferently. He is the guilty one. For that is enough to precipitate all the rancors and all the boredom still in suspension. But if it is hard to fix the precise instant, the subtle step when the mind opted for death, it is easier to deduce from the act itself the consequences it implies. In a sense, and as in melodrama, killing yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not understand it. Let's not go too far in such analogies, however, but rather return to everyday words. It is merely confessing that that \"is not worth the trouble.\" Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering. What, then, is that incalculable feeling that deprives the mind of the sleep necessary to life? A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land.

The common lot of married couples. You get married, you go on loving a bit longer, you work. And you work so hard that it makes you forget to love. As the head of the office where Grand was employed hadn't kept his promise, Jeanne, too, had to work outside. At this point a little imagination was needed to grasp what Grand was trying to convey. Owing largely to fatigue, he gradually lost grip of himself, had less and less to say, and failed to keep alive the feeling in his wife that she was loved. An overworked husband, poverty, the gradual loss of hope in a better future, silent evenings at home, what chance had any passion of surviving such conditions? Probably Jeanne had suffered. And yet she'd stayed; of course one may often suffer a long time without knowing it. Thus years went by. Then, one day, she left him. Naturally she hadn't gone alone. \"I was very fond of you, but now I'm so tired.

Beneath her, the blue-and-white terraces of the Arab town overlapped one another, splattered with the dark-red spots of the peppers drying in the sun. Not a soul could be seen, but from the inner courts, together with the aroma of roasting coffee, there rose laughing voices or incomprehensible stamping of feet. Father off, the palm grove, divided into uneven squares by clay walls, rustled its upper foliage in a wind that could not be felt up on the terace. Still farther off and all the way to the horizon extended the ocher-and-gray realm of stones, in which no life was visible. At some distance from the oasis, however, near the wadi that bordered the palm grove on the west could be seen broad black tents. All around them a flock of motionless dromedaries, tiny at the distance, formed against the gray ground the black signs of a strange handwriting, the meaning of which had to be deciphered. Above the desert, the silence was as vast as the space. Janine, leaning her whole body against the parapet, was speechless, unable to tear herself away from the void opening before her. Beside her, Marcel was getting restless. He was cold; he wanted to go back down. What was there to see here, after all? But she could not take her gaze from the horizon. Over yonder, still farther south, at that point where sky and earth met in a pure line - over yonder it suddenly seemed there was awaiting her something of which, though it had always been lacking, she had never been aware until now. In the advancing afternoon the light relaxed and softened; it was passing from the crystalline to the liquid. Simultaneously, in the heart of a woman brought there by pure chance a knot tightened by the years, habit, and boredom was slowly loosening. She was looking at the nomads' encampment. She had not even seen the men living in it' nothing was stirring among the black tents, and yet she could think only of them whose existence she had barely known until this day. Homeless, cut off from the world, they were a handful wandering over the vast territory she could see, which however was but a paltry part of an even greater expanse whose dizzying course stopped only thousands of miles farther south, where the first river finally waters the forest. Since the beginning of time, on the dry earth of this limitless land scraped to bone, a few men had been ceaselessly trudging, possessing nothing but serving no one, poverty-stricken but free lords of a strange kingdom. Janine did not know why this thought filled her with such a sweet, vast melancholy that it closed her eyes. She knew that this kingdom had been eternally promised her and yet that it would never be hers, never again, except in this fleeting moment perhaps when she opened her eyes again on the suddenly motionless sky and on its waves of steady light, while the voices rising from the Arab town suddenly fell silent. It seemed to her that the world's course had just stopped and that, from that moment on, no one would ever age any more or die.

During the day the hall is protected by sloping wooden awnings. When the sun goes down they are raised. Then the hall is filled with an odd green light born of the double shell of the sky and the sea. When one is seated far from the windows, one sees only the sky and, silhouetted against it, the faces of the dancers passing in succession. Sometimes a waltz is being played, and against the green background the black profiles whirl obstinately like those cut-out silhouettes that are attached to a phonograph's turntable. Night comes rapidly after this, and with it the lights. But I am unable to relate the thrill and secrecy that subtle instant holds for me. I recall at least a magnificent tall girl who had danced all afternoon. She was wearing a jasmine garland on her right blue dress, wet with perspiration from the small of her back to her legs. She was laughing as she danced and throwing back her head. As she passed the tables, she left behind her a mingled scent of flowers and flesh. When evening came, I could no longer see her body pressed tight to her partner, but against her body alternating spots of white jasmine and black hair, and when she would throw back her swelling breast I would hear her laugh and see her partner's profile suddenly plunge forward.

The doctrine of the superman led to the methodical creation of sub-men—a fact that doubtless should be denounced, butwhich also demands interpretation.

Analizele sale îl duc la concluzia că «lumea nu-i mai poate oferi nimic omului înspăimîntat». «Grija» îi pare a depăşi prin adevărul ei categoriile raţionamentului, încît nu se gîndeşte decît la ea şi nu vorbeşte decît despre ea. Îi enumeră înfăţişările: plictiseala, cînd omul banal încearcă să o niveleze în el însuşi şi să o înăbuşe; groaza, cînd spiritul contemplă moartea. Nici el nu desparte conştiinţa de absurd. Conştiinţa morţii este chemarea grijii şi «existenţa îşi adresează atunci sieşi un apel prin intermediul conştiinţei».

Ces cinq mille francs, arrivés à la fin d’une vie, se révélèrent assez encombrants. Il fallait les placer. Si presque tous les hommes sont capables de se servir d’une grosse fortune, la difficulté commence quand la somme est petite. Cette femme resta fidèle à elle-même. Près de la mort, elle voulut abriter ses vieux os. Une véritable occasion s’offrait à elle. Au cimetière de sa ville, une concession venait d’expirer et, sur ce terrain, les propriétaires avaient érigé un somptueux caveau, sobre de lignes, en marbre noir, un vrai trésor à tout dire, qu’on lui laissait pourla somme de quatre mille francs. Elle acheta ce caveau. C’était là une valeur sûre, à l’abri des fluctuations boursières et des événements politiques. Elle fit aménager la fosse intérieure, la tint prête à recevoir son propre corps. Et, tout achevé, elle fit graver son nom en capitales d’or.Cette affaire la contenta si profondément qu’elle fut prise d’un véritable amour pour son tombeau. Elle venait voir au début les progrès des travaux Elle finit par se rendre visite tous les dimanches après-midi. Ce fut son unique sortie et sa seule distraction. Vers deux heures de l’après-midi, elle faisait le long trajet qui l’amenait aux portes de la ville où se trouvait le cimetière. Elle entrait dans le petit caveau, refermait soigneusement la porte, et s’agenouillait sur le prie-Dieu. C’est ainsi que, mise en présence d’elle-même, confrontant ce qu’elle était et ce qu’elle devait être, retrouvant l’anneau d’une chaîne toujours rompue, elle perça sans effort les desseins secrets de la Providence.

À la Toussaint, arrivée plus tard que d’habitude, elle trouva le pas de la porte pieusement jonché de violettes.

Even if God existed, Ivan would never surrender to Him in the face of the injustice done to man. But alonger contemplation of this injustice, a more bitter approach, transformed the \"even if you exist\" into \"you do notdeserve to exist,\" therefore \"you do not exist.\" The victims have found in their own innocence the justification forthe final crime. Convinced of their condemnation and without hope of immortality, they decided to murder God. If itis false to say that from that day began the tragedy of contemporary man, neither is it true to say that there waswhere it ended. On the contrary, this attempt indicates the highest point in a drama that began with the end of theancient world and of which the final words have not yet been spoken. From this moment, man decides to excludehimself from grace and to live by his own means. Progress, from the time of Sade up to the present day, hasconsisted in gradually enlarging the stronghold where, according to his own rules, man without God brutally wieldspower. In defiance of the divinity, the frontiers of this stronghold have been gradually extended, to the point ofmaking the entire universe into a fortress erected against the fallen and exiled deity. Man, at the culmination of hisrebellion, incarcerated himself; from Sade's lurid castleto the concentration camps, man's greatest liberty consisted only in building the prison of his crimes. But the state ofsiege gradually spreads, the demand for freedom wants to embrace all mankind. Then the only kingdom that isopposed to the kingdom of grace must be founded —namely, the kingdom of justice—and the human communitymust be reunited among the debris of the fallen City of God. To kill God and to build a Church are the constant andcontradictory purpose of rebellion. Absolute freedom finally becomes a prison of absolute duties, a collectiveasceticism, a story to be brought to an end.

For one principle to triumph, another principle must be overthrown. The city of light of which Spartacus dreamed could only have been built on the ruins of eternal Rome, of its institutions and of its gods. Spartacus’ army marches to lay siege to a Rome paralyzed with fear at the prospect of having to pay for its crimes. At the decisive moment, however, within sight of the sacred walls, the army halts and wavers, as if it were retreating before the principles, the institutions, the city of the gods. When these had been destroyed, what could be put in their place except the brutal desire for justice, the wounded and exacerbated love that until this moment had kept these wretches on their feet.2 In any case, the army retreated without having fought, and then made the curious move of deciding to return to the place where the slave rebellion originated, to retrace the long road of its victories and to return to Sicily. It was as though these outcasts, forever alone and helpless before the great tasks that awaited them and too daunted to assail the heavens, returned to what was purest and most heartening in their history, to the land of their first awakening, where it was easy and right to die.Then began their defeat and martyrdom. Before the last battle, Spartacus crucified a Roman citizen to show his men the fate that was in store for them. During the battle, Spartacus himself tried with frenzied determination, the symbolism of which is obvious, to reach Crassus, who was commanding the Roman legions. He wanted to perish, but in single combat with the man who symbolized, at that moment, every Roman master; it was his dearest wish to die, but in absolute equality. He did not reach Crassus: principles wage war at a distance and the Roman general kept himself apart. Spartacus died, as he wished, but at the hands of mercenaries, slaves like himself, who killed their own freedom with his. In revenge for the one crucified citizen, Crassus crucified thousands of slaves. The six thousand crosses which, after such a just rebellion, staked out the road from Capua to Rome demonstrated to the servile crowd that there is no equality in the world of power and that the masters calculate, at a usurious rate, the price of their own blood."},{"id":2044,"quote":"Iar dacă azi sînt nefericită, deşi sînt convinsă de dragostea ta, e pentru că sînt sigură că ai să-mi spui să plec.

In a more serious fashion, the idea of a science that steadily increases itsconquests can also be derived from Cartesian philosophy. But Turgot, in 1750, is the first person to give aclear definition of the new faith. His treatise on the progress of the human mind basically recapitulatesBossuet's universal history. The idea of progress alone is substituted for the divine will. \"The total massof the human race, by alternating stages of calm and agitation, of good and evil, always marches, thoughwith dragging footsteps, toward greater and greater perfection.\" This optimistic statement will furnish thebasic ingredient of the rhetorical observations of Condorcet, the official theorist of progress, which helinked with the progress of the State and of which he was also the official victim in that the enlightenedState forced him to poison himself. Sorel was perfectly correct in saying that the philosophy of progresswas exactly the philosophy to suit a society eager to enjoy the material prosperity derived from technicalprogress.

It does not choose feelings or passions to give a detailed description of, such as we find in classicFrench novels. It rejects analysis and the search for a fundamental psychological motive that could explain andrecapitulate the behavior of a character. This is why the unity of this novel form is only the unity of the flash ofrecognition. Its technique consists in describing men by their outside appearances, in their most casual actions, ofreproducing, without comment, everything they say down to their repetitions,and finally by acting as if men wereentirely defined by their daily automatisms. On this mechanical level men, in fact, seem exactly alike, whichexplains this peculiar universe in which all the characters appear interchangeable, even down to their physicalpeculiarities. This technique is called realistic only owing to a misapprehension. In addition to the fact that realismin art is, as we shall see, an incomprehensible idea, it is perfectly obvious that this fictitious world is not attemptinga reproduction, pure and simple, of reality, but the most arbitrary form of stylization. It is born of a mutilation, andof a voluntary mutilation, performed on reality. The unity thus obtained is a degraded unity, a leveling off of humanbeings and of the world. It would seem that for these writers it is the inner life that deprives human actions of unityand that tears people away from one another. This is a partially legitimate suspicion.

The dialectic miracle, the transformation of quantityinto quality, is explained here: it is the decision to call total servitude freedom. Moreover, as in all theexamples cited by Hegel and Marx, there is no objective transformation, but only a subjective change ofdenomination. In other words, there is no miracle. If the only hope of nihilism lies in thinking thatmillions of slaves can one day constitute a humanity which will be freed forever, then history is nothingbut a desperate dream.

If theAmerican novel is the novel of men without memory, the world of Proust is nothing but memory. It isconcerned only with the most difficult and most exacting of memories, the memory that rejects thedispersion of the actual world and derives, from the trace of a lingering perfume, the secret of a new andancient universe. Proust chooses the interior life and, of the interior life, that which is more interior thanlife itself in preference to what is forgotten in the world of reality— in other words, the purely mechanicaland blind aspects of the world. But by his rejection of reality he does not deny reality. He does notcommit the error, which would counterbalance the error of American fiction, of suppressingthe mechanical.

On the contrary, rebellion puts total freedom up for trial. It specifically attacks the unlimitedpower that authorizes a superior to violate the forbidden frontier. Far from demanding generalindependence, the rebel wants it to be recognized that freedom has its limits everywhere that a humanbeing is to be found—the limit being precisely that human being's power to rebel. The most profoundreason for rebellious intransigence is to be found here. The more aware rebellion is of demanding a justlimit, the more inflexible it becomes. The rebel undoubtedly demands a certain degree of freedom forhimself; but in no case, if he is consistent, does he demand the right to destroy the existence and thefreedom of others. He humiliates no one. The freedom he claims, he claims for all; the freedom herefuses, he forbids everyone to enjoy. He is not only the slave against the master, but also man against theworld of master and slave. Therefore, thanks to rebellion, there is something more in history than therelation between mastery and servitude. Unlimited power is not the only law. It is in the name of anothervalue that the rebel affirms the impossibility of total freedom while he claims for himself the relativefreedom necessary to recognize this impossibility. Every human freedom, at its very roots, is thereforerelative. Absolute freedom, which is the freedom to kill, is the only one which does not claim, at the sametime as itself, the things that limitand obliterate it.

Still greater production, still more power, uninterrupted labor, incessant suffering, permanent war, and then a moment will come when universal bondage in the totalitarian empire will be miraculously changed into its opposite: free leisure in a universal republic. Pseudo-revolutionary mystification has now acquired a formula: all freedom must be crushed in order to conquer the empire, and one day the empire will be the equivalent of freedom. And so the way to unity passes through totality.[...]Totality is, in effect, nothing other than the ancient dream of unity common to both believers and rebels, but projected horizontally onto an earth deprived of God. To renounce every value, therefore, amounts to renouncing rebellion in order to accept the Empire and slavery. Criticism of formal values cannot pass over the concept of freedom. Once the impossibility has been recognized of creating, by means of the forces of rebellion alone, the free individual of whom the romantics dreamed, freedom itself has also been incorporated in the movement of history. It has become freedom fighting for existence, which, in order to exist, must create itself. Identified with the dynamism of history, it cannot play its proper role until history comes to a stop, in the realization of the Universal City. Until then, every one of its victories will lead to an antithesis that will render it pointless. The German nation frees itself from its oppressors, but at the price of the freedom of every German. The individuals under a totalitarian regime are not free, even though man in the collective sense is free. Finally, when the Empire delivers the entire human species, freedom will reign over herds of slaves, who at least will be free in relation to God and, in general, in relation to every kind of transcendence. The dialectic miracle, the transformation of quantity into quality, is explained here: it is the decision to call total servitude freedom. Moreover, as in all the examples cited by Hegel and Marx, there is no objective transformation, but only a subjective change of denomination. In other words, there is no miracle. If the only hope of nihilism lies in thinking that millions of slaves can one day constitute a humanity which will be freed forever, then history is nothing but a desperate dream. Historical thought was to deliver man from subjection to a divinity; but this liberation demanded of him the most absolute subjection to historical evolution. Then man takes refuge in the permanence of the party in the same way that he formerly prostrated himself before the altar. That is why the era which dares to claim that it is the most rebellious that has ever existed only offers a choice of various types of conformity. The real passion of the twentieth century is servitude."},{"id":2187,"quote":"The evil that is in the world always comes of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence, if they lack understanding.

The rebel slave affirms that there is something in him which will not tolerate the manner in which his master treats him; the metaphysical rebel declares that he is frustrated by the universe. For both of them it is not only a problem of pure and simple negation. In fact in both cases we find an assessment of values in the name of which the rebel refuses to accept the condition in which he finds himself. The slave who opposes his master is not concerned, let us note, with repudiating his master as a human being. He is repudiating him as master. He denies his right to deny him, as a slave, by making excessive demands. The master fails to the extent that he does not respond to a demand that he ignores. If men cannot refer to common values, which they all separately recognize, then man is incomprehensible to man. The rebel demands that these values should be clearly recognized as part of himself because he knows or suspects that, without them, crime and disorder would reign in the world. An act of rebellion seems to him like a demand for clarity and unity. The most elementary rebellion, paradoxically, expresses an aspiration to order. This description can be applied, word for word, to the metaphysical rebel. He attacks a shattered world to make it whole. He confronts the injustice at large in the world with his own principles of justice. Thus all he originally wants is to resolve this contradiction and establish a reign of justice, if he can, or of injustice if he is driven to the end of his tether. Meanwhile he denounces the contradiction. Metaphysical rebellion is the justified claim of a desire for unity against the suffering of life and death – in that it protests against the incompleteness of human life, expressed by death, and its dispersion, expressed by evil. If a mass death sentence defines man’s condition, then rebellion, in one sense, is its contemporary."},{"id":2466,"quote":"La vérité est mystérieuse, fuyante, toujoursà conquérir.

In fact, nothing could be clearer. Whether it was now or twenty years from now, I would still be the one dying. At that point, what would disturb my train of thought was the terrifying leap I would feel my heart take at the idea of having twenty more years of life ahead of me.

Un comentator citează din el cîteva cuvinte care merită tot interesul: «Singura ieşire adevărată, spune Şestov, se află tocmai acolo unde nu există ieşire pentru judecata omenească. Altminteri, de ce am avea nevoie de Dumnezeu? Omul nu se întoarce către Dumnezeu decît pentru a obţine imposibilul. Cît priveşte posibilul, oamenii îi pot face singuri faţă.» Dacă există o filosofie şestoviană, atunci pot fără îndoială afirma că ea se află în întregime rezumată astfel. Căci atunci cînd, ajuns la capătul analizelor sale pasionante, Şestov descoperă absurditatea fundamentală a oricărei existenţe, el nu spune: «Iată absurdul», ci: «Iată-1 pe Dumnezeu: trebuie să ne lăsăm în voia Lui, chiar dacă El nu corespunde niciuneia din categoriile noastre raţionale». Pentru ca nicio confuzie să nu mai fie cu putinţă, filosoful rus insinuează chiar că acest Dumnezeu este poate plin de ură si vrednic de ură, incomprehensibil şi contradictoriu, dar că el îşi afirmă cu atît mai mult puterea cu cît chipul Lui este mâi hîd. Măreţia Sa stă tocmai în inconsecvenţa sa. Dovada existenţei sale este tocmai inumanitatea Sa. Trebuie să facem saltul în El şi, prin aceasta, să ne eliberăm de iluziile raţiunii. Astfel, pentru Şestov, acceptarea absurdului este contemporană cu însuşi absurdul. A-l constata înseamnă a-1 accepta şi tot efortul logic al gîndirii sale constă în a-1 pune în evidenţă pentru a face astfel să ţîşnească speranţa imensă pe care o aduce cu sine."},{"id":2526,"quote":"Por eso resulta tan desgarrador el amor de los hombres.

God is dead, but as Stirnerpredicted, the morality of principles in which the memory of God is still preserved must also be killed.The hatred of formal virtue—degraded witness to divinity and false witness in the service of injustice—has remained one of the principal themes of history today. Nothing is pure: that is the cry whichconvulses our period.

Iată, de acum înainte, raţiunea libertăţii mele profunde. Voi face aici două comparaţii. Misticii află mai întîi o libertate în dăruirea de sine. Nimicindu-se întru Dumnezeul lor, urmîndu-i poruncile, devin la rîndul lor, în adîncul inimii, liberi. În sclavia liber consimţită, ei află o independenţă profundă. Dar ce înseamnă această libertate? Putem spune mai cu seamă că se simt liberi faţă de ei înşişi şi nu atît liberi, cît, mai ales, liberaţi. Tot astfel, întors cu totul înspre moarte (considerată aici drept absurditatea cea mai evidentă), omul absurd se simte eliberat de tot ceea ce nu este atenţie pasionată care cristalizează în el. El gustă o anumită libertate faţă de regulile comune. Vedem aici că temele iniţiale ale filosofiei existenţialiste îşi păstrează întreaga valoare. Trezirea la conştiinţă, evadarea din somnul cotidian reprezintă primele demersuri ale libertăţii absurde. Vizată însă este învăţătura existenţialistă şi, odată cu ea, acel salt spiritual care, în fond, se sustrage conştiinţei. Tot astfel (e a doua mea comparaţie), sclavii din antichitate nu-şi aparţineau. Dar ei cunoşteau libertatea de a nu se simţi responsabili. Şi moartea are mîini patriciene care strivesc, dar care eliberează. În faptul de a te pierde în această certitudine fără margini, de a te simţi îndeajuns de străin de propria ta viaţă ca s-o poţi spori şi străbate fără miopia amantului există principiul unei eliberări. Această nouă independenţă are un sfirşit, ca orice libertate de acţiune. Nu emite un cec pentru eternitate. Dar înlocuieşte iluziile libertăţii, care se opreau toate în faţa morţii. Divina disponibilitate a condamnatului la moarte în faţa căruia se deschid porţile închisorii într-o anume zi în zori, indiferenţa sa de necrezut faţă de toate, în afară de flacăra pură a vieţii, moartea şi absurdul sunt aici, e lesne de văzut, principiile singurei libertăţi raţionale: aceea pe care o inimă omenească o poate simţi şi trăi! Iată a doua consecinţă. Omul absurd întrevede astfel un univers fierbinte şi îngheţat, transparent şi limitat, în care nimic nu-i cu putinţă dar totul este dat, după care urmează prăbuşirea şi neantul.

As for the means of sucha surprising demonstration, they were even more simple: with each new difficulty encountered by the revolution, theState as described by Marx is endowed with a supplementary prerogative.

Already we can perceive the contradiction of the Stalinistregime in conflict with its official philosophy. Either this regime has realized the classless socialist society, and themaintenance of a formidable apparatus of repression is not justified in Marxist terms, or it has not realized theclassless society and has therefore proved that Marxist doctrine is erroneous and, in particular, that the socializationof the means of production does not mean the disappearance of classes.

In its desire, theexterior world consists of what it does not possess, but which nevertheless exists, and of what it wouldlike to exist but which no longer does.

It therefore acts inorder to gratify itself and, in so doing, it denies and suppresses its means of gratification. It is the epitomeof negation. To act is to destroy in order to give birth to the spiritual reality of consciousness. But todestroy an object unconsciously, as meat is destroyed, for example, in the act of eating, is a purely animalactivity. To consume is not yet to be conscious. Desire for consciousness must be directed towardsomething other than unconscious nature. The only thing in the world that is distinct from nature is,precisely, self-consciousness. Therefore desire must be centered upon another form of desire; selfconsciousnessmust be gratified by another form of self-consciousness.

But Utopia, at least in the form he knew it, is destined to serve cynicism, of which he wanted no part. Marx destroys all transcendence, then carries out, by himself, the transition from fact to duty. But his concept of duty has no other origin but fact. The demand for justice ends in injustice if it is not primarily based on an ethical justification of justice; without this, crime itself one day becomes a duty. When good and evil are reintegrated in time and confused with events, nothing is any longer good or bad, but only either premature or out of date. Who will decide on the opportunity, if not the opportunist? Later, say the disciples, you shall judge. But the victims will not be there to judge. For the victim, the present is the only value, rebellion the only action. Messianism, in order to exist, must construct a defense against the victims.

He enumerates its aspects: boredom when the ordinary man strives to quash it in him and benumb it; terror when the mind contemplates death. He too does not separate consciousness from the absurd. The consciousness of death is the call of anxiety and \"existence then delivers itself its own summons through the intermediary of consciousness.\" It is the very voice of anguish and it adjures existence \"to return from its loss in the anonymous They.\" For him, too, one must not sleep, but must keep alert until the consummation.

The history and the tragedy of our times really begin with him. He only believed that a society founded on freedom of crime must coincide with freedom of morals, as though servitude had its limits. Our times have limited themselves to blending, in a curious manner, his dream of a universal republic and his technique of degradation. Finally, what he hated most, legal murder, has availed itself of the discoveries that he wanted to put to the service of instinctive murder.

If the people are free, they are infallible.Once the King is dead, andthe chains of the old despotism thrown off, the people are going to express what, at all times and in allplaces, is, has been, and will be the truth.

The period of monsters has cometo an end with the termination of the period of violence. \"The human heart advances from nature toviolence, from violence to morality.\" Morality is, therefore, only nature finally restored after centuries ofalienation.

We then have authority to say that any type of rebellion which claims the right to deny or destroy this solidarity simultaneously loses the right to be called rebellion and actually becomes an accomplice to murder. In the same way, this solidarity, except in so far as religion is concerned, only comes to life on the level of rebellion. And so the real drama of revolutionary thought is revealed. In order to exist, man must rebel, but rebellion must respect the limits that it discovers in itself – limits where minds meet and, in meeting, begin to exist. Revolutionary thought, therefore, cannot dispense with memory: it is in a perpetual state of tension. In contemplating the result of an act of rebellion, we shall have to say, each time, whether it remains faithful to its first noble promise or whether, through lassitude or folly, it forgets its purpose and plunges into a mire of tyranny or servitude."},{"id":3361,"quote":"La palabra “peste acababa de ser pronunciada por primera vez.

The narrator does not share this view. The evil in the world comes almost always from ignorance, and goodwill can cause as much damage as ill-will if it is not enlightened. People are more often good than bad, though in fact that is not the question.

That nostalgia for unity, that appetite for the absolute illustrates the essential impulse for the human drama. But the fact of that nostalgia’s existence does not imply that it is to be immediately satisfied. For if, bridging the gulf that separates desire from conquest, we assert with Parmenides the reality of the One (whatever it may be) we fall into the ridiculous contradiction of a mind that asserts total unity and proves by its very assertion its own difference and the diversity it claimed to resolve. This other vicious circle is enough to stifle our hopes."},{"id":3554,"quote":"it is easier to deduce from the act itself the consequences it implies. In a sense, and as in melodrama, killing yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not understand it. Let’s not go too far in such analogies, however, but rather return to everyday words. It is merely confessing that that “is not worth the trouble. Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering.”"},{"id":3555,"quote":"Mentir n'est pas seulement dire ce qui n'est pas, c'est aussi c'est surtout dire plus que ce qui est et, en ce qui concerne le cœur humain, dire plus qu'on ne sent."},{"id":3556,"quote":"Báo chí tự do, dĩ nhiên, có thể tốt cũng có thể xấu, nhưng hầu như chắc chắn nếu không có tự do, báo chí chỉ có thể là xấu."},{"id":3557,"quote":"Mes frères, vous êtes dans le malheur, mes frères, vous l’avez mérité », un remous parcourut l’assistance jusqu’au parvis."},{"id":3558,"quote":"- Vous n'avez pas encore compris, répondit Rambert, en haussant les épaules.- Quoi donc ?- La peste.- Ah ! fit Rieux.- Non, vous n'avez pas compris que ça consiste à recommencer."}]
